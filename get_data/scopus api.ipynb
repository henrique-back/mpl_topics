Microfibers were the most abundant shape with the highest numbers (35.52%) as compared to the rest of the MPs identified. Transparent microfibers were recorded as the highest in numbers followed by red, black, blue, and green. In this study, KOH with different concentrations and exposure times along with oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide was tested (Protocols 3 and 4).

It has been suggested that combining multi-spectral satellite information and machine learning approaches are effective to monitor plastic pollutants in the ocean environment. Recent research has made theoretical progress in identifying marine debris and suspected plastic (MD&SP) through machine learning whereas no study has fully explored the application of these methods for mapping and monitoring marine debris density. Therefore, this article consists of three main components: (1) the development and validation of a supervised machine learning marine debris detection model, (2) to map the MD&SP density into an automated tool called MAP-Mapper and finally (3) evaluation of the entire system for out-of-distribution (OOD) test locations. Developed MAP-Mapper architectures provide users with options to achieve high precision (abbv. -HP) or optimum precision-recall (abbv. -Opt) values in terms of training/test dataset. Our MAP-Mapper-HP model greatly increases the MD&SP detection precision to 95%, while the MAP-Mapper-Opt achieves 87\\xe2\\x80\\x9388% precision\\xe2\\x80\\x93recall pair. To efficiently measure density mapping findings at OOD test locations, we propose the Marine Debris Map (MDM) index, which combines the average probability of a pixel belonging to the MD&SP class and the number of detections in a given time frame. The high MDM findings of the proposed approach are found to be consistent with existing marine litter and plastic pollution areas, and these are presented with available evidence citing literature and field studies.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152645322\",\"dc:title\":\"Comparison of learning models to predict LDPE, PET, and ABS concentrations in beach sediment based on spectral reflectance\",\"dc:creator\":\"Huda F.R.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Scientific Reports\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1038/s41598-023-33207-x\",\"dc:description\":\"Microplastic (MP) contamination on land has been estimated to be 32 times higher than in the oceans, and yet there is a distinct lack of research on soil MPs compared to marine MPs.

It is also strongly influenced by both the tidal oscillating currents characteristic to the bay and vertical terminal velocity of MP particles.

The microplastic contamination in edible tissues (flesh) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the majority of studied organisms.

Single-use plastics (SUPs) are disposable plastics designed to be used once then promptly discarded or recycled. This SUPs range from packaging and takeaway containers to disposable razors and hotel toiletries. Synthetic plastics, which are made of non-renewable petroleum and natural gas resources, require decades to perpetually disintegrate in nature thus contribute to plastic pollution worldwide, especially in marine environments. In response to these problems, bioplastics or bio-based and biodegradable polymers from renewable sources has been considered as an alternative. Understanding the mechanisms behind the degradation of conventional SUPs and biodegradability of their greener counterpart, bioplastics, is crucial for appropriate material selection in the future. This review aims to provide insights into the degradation or disintegration of conventional single-use plastics and the biodegradability of the different types of greener-counterparts, bioplastics, their mechanisms, and conditions. This review highlights on the biodegradation in the environments including composting systems. Here, the various types of alternative biodegradable polymers, such as bacterially biosynthesised bioplastics, natural fibre-reinforced plastics, starch-, cellulose-, lignin-, and soy-based polymers were explored. Review of past literature revealed that although bioplastics are relatively eco-friendly, their natural compositions and properties are inconsistent. Furthermore, the global plastic market for biodegradable plastics remains relatively small and require further research and commercialization efforts, especially considering the urgency of plastic and microplastic pollution as currently critical global issue. Biodegradable plastics have potential to replace conventional plastics as they show biodegradation ability under real environments, and thus intensive research on the various biodegradable plastics is needed to inform stakeholders and policy makers on the appropriate response to the gradually emerging biodegradable plastics.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Biobased plastics | Biodegradable | Biopolymer | Compostable | Degradation | Disposable plastics\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85158064362\",\"dc:title\":\"Settling of buoyant microplastic in estuaries: The importance of flocculation\",\"dc:creator\":\"Laursen S.N.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-08-15\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163976\",\"dc:description\":\"Rivers and estuaries are regarded as major pathways of microplastic (MP) transport from terrestrial areas to marine ecosystems. Despite this knowledge on the transport dynamics and fate of MP in freshwater riverine and brackish estuarine waters is limited. Via ex situ settling experiments emulating the Msimbazi River and Estuary in Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate that flocculation and subsequent settling of positively buoyant MP and fine-grained suspended sediment in riverine and estuarine waters are important for the environmental fate of the plastic particles. Our results show that settling velocities of MP and fine-grained sediment in estuarine water were between five and 21 times larger than in freshwater, explained by the increase in ionic strength that occurs when particles enter saline water. This confirms the concept of increased flocculation and settling of fine-grained particles as they are transported from freshwater to estuarine and marine waters. The implication is that land-based sources of small positively buoyant high-density polyethylene (HDPE) MP transported by rivers will tend to settle and accumulate in estuarine environments and thereby lead to a decrease in the overall load of MPs delivered to the wider marine environment. Thereby our results support the notion of estuaries as MP traps and that flocculation explains the trapping of large quantities of MP debris. Based on these findings we recommend that the interaction of MP with fine-grained sediment should be taken into account when transport models of this pollutant are established.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Buoyant microplastic | Estuary | Flocculation | Settling experiments | Urban catchment\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153794612\",\"dc:title\":\"Rethinking plastic recycling: A comparison between North America and Europe\",\"dc:creator\":\"Ackerman J.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Journal of Environmental Management\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-08-15\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117859\",\"dc:description\":\"In this article, we identify the problem of plastic proliferation, the consequent expansion of plastic waste in our society, the inadequacies of current attempts to recycle plastic, and the urgency to address this problem in the light of the microplastic threat. It details the problems with current efforts to recycle plastic and the particularly poor recycling rates in North America (NA) when compared to certain countries in the European Union (EU). The obstacles to plastic recycling are overlapping economic, physical and regulatory problems spanning fluctuating resale market prices, residue and polymer contamination and offshore export which often circumvents the entire process. The primary differences between the EU and NA are the costs of end-of-life disposal methods with most EU citizens paying much higher prices for both landfilling and Energy from Waste (incineration) costs compared with NA. At the time of writing, some EU states are either restricted from landfilling mixed plastic waste or the cost is significantly greater than in NA ($80 to 125 USD/t vs $55 USD/t). This makes recycling a favourable option in the EU, and, in turn, has led to more industrial processing and innovation, more recycled product uptake, and the structuring of collection and sorting methods that favour cleaner polymer streams. This is a self-re-enforcing cycle and is evident by EU technologies and industries that have emerged to process \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem plastics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, such as mixed plastic film wastes, co-polymer films, thermosets, Polystyrene, (PS) Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), and others.

Circularity is far from complete in any jurisdiction as export of plastic to developing countries is an opaque, but often used disposal method in the EU as it is in NA. Proposed restrictions on off-shore shipping and regulations requiring minimum recycled plastic content in new products will potentially increase plastic recycling by increasing both supply and demand for recycled product.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Landfill | Plastic pollution | Plastics | Polymers | Recycling\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85158011940\",\"dc:title\":\"Microplastics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 An emerging contaminants for algae.

In aquatic ecosystems, algae are important primary producers providing nutrients for a wide range of species, so they play a fundamental role in maintaining the balance of the marine ecosystem. Thus, the toxic effect of pollutants on algae can have a negative impact on organisms at higher trophic levels. The microplastic toxic effect on algae is studied by many researches, leading to many different conclusions due to different experimental designs. The polymer type is an important parameter, as it influences the growth rate, the photosynthetic pigments content, and the oxidative stress. Polystyrene is considered more toxic than other types of microplastics. Studies show that plastics of a smaller size and with a positive surface charge have a higher toxic effect on algae. MNPs toxicity to algae strongly depends on their concentration, and becomes more severe as its level increase. Moreover, size and concentration of plastic particles influence changes in reactive oxygen species and the enzymatic antioxidant activity. MNPs are also a vector for other environmental pollutants. Effects of pollutant-MNPs complexes are more often found to be antagonistic than synergetic, in consequence of toxic substance adsorption on the MNPs surface and their lower bioavailability to algae. The aim of this review was to summarize effects and impacts of microplastics and coexisting pollutants on algal populations, on the basis of currently available literature.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Algae and microalgae | Microplastic and nanoplastic | Toxicity | Xenobiotic\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85157995291\",\"dc:title\":\"Abundance, distribution and composition of microplastics in sediment and fish species from an Urban River of Bangladesh\",\"dc:creator\":\"Khan M.B.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-08-10\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163876\",\"dc:description\":\"Microplastics (MPs) are a growing concern due to its ubiquitous presence and exceptional stability.

However, the literature with respect to microplastics generation is generally limited to surface observations of polypropylene and polyethylene.

A dominate contributing source of microplastic particles is the fragmentation of macroplastics from manufactured goods, alongside laundered synthetic material, abrasion of vehicle tyres and personal care products. The indiscriminate use of plastic and poor management of plastic waste pose serious threat to ecosystem functionality and resilience. Understanding the key underlying transport and mixing mechanisms which influence the behavior of microplastics and their environmental fate are crucial for identify potential microplastic fate-transport pathways from source to sink. This is fundamental for evaluating microplastic interactions and impact on ecosystems. This paper presents laboratory-based tracer measurements for solute and polyethylene (PE) microplastics in the presence of waves. The tests were undertaken in a wave tank equipped with an active absorption paddle-type wave-maker. Fluorescent dye was used to stain the PE particles using a novel staining technique. Rhodamine dye was used as a proxy for the transport of solute pollutants. The temporal and spatial behavior of both microplastics and solute across the nearshore zone was measured using submersible fiber optic fluorometers. Hydrodynamic conditions were designed to create monochromatic waves with a range of wave steepness Sop = 2 - 5 %. Tracer measurements were conducted at three locations, seaward of the breaker region, breaker region and inner surf zone to provide a comprehensive understanding of mixing across the nearshore. The dispersion coefficients were determined for both solute and PE particles. The results indicate the dominant role of surface and bed generated turbulence in determining mixing and dispersion influenced by wave breaker type and width of the surf zone. The comparison of tracer data suggests that PE particles, with similar density to water, and the solute tracer have a similar transport and mixing behavior under the influence of waves.\",\"citedby-count\":\"4\",\"authkeywords\":\"Dispersion | Fluorometric tracing | Microplastics | Nearshore | Pollution transport | Turbulent mixing\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099156920\",\"dc:title\":\"Oceanic giants in the Mediterranean: First mitochondrial analysis of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas\",\"dc:creator\":\"Garofalo L.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Natura Croatica\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-31\",\"dc:description\":\"The leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea (Vandelli, 1761) is an occasional trophic visitor of the Mediterranean basin.

TWP was generated on the roads and migrated to the environment matrix by runoff. It was detected in several environment media such as pavement, soil, water, sediment and organisms. The selection of markers was important because the determination of TWP was mainly achieved by detecting markers. The pollution of TWP was caused by adsorption and leaching of contaminants, which pose certain risk to human and organism. The direct ways to control TWP were intercept the particles during migration and accelerate the decomposition of TWP in the environment. Improved tire formulation could decrease the wear rate and reduce the emission of tire particles. At present, there are many study gaps such as TWP properties, detection methods, environmental fate and so on, which hampers assessing the risk of TWP in the environment.

Organic residues hamper the separation of polymer particles especially within density separation or polymer identification via spectroscopic and staining methods. Therefore, a concise literature survey has been undertaken to identify the most commonly applied digestion protocols with a special focus on water and sediments samples. The selected protocols comprise different solutions, concentrations, and reaction temperatures. Within this study we tested acids (nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), bases (sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide), and oxidizing agents [hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite and Fenton\\'s reagent (hydrogen peroxide 30% in combination with iron(II)sulfate 0.27%)] at different concentrations, temperature levels, and reaction times on their efficiency of biogenic organic matter destruction and the resistance of different synthetic polymers against the applied digestion protocols. Tests were carried out in three parallels on organic material (soft tissue\\xe2\\x80\\x94leaves, hard tissue\\xe2\\x80\\x94branches, and calcareous material\\xe2\\x80\\x94shells) and six polymers (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate) in two size categories. Before and after the application of different digestion protocols, the material was weighed in order to determine the degree of digestion efficiency and polymer resistance, respectively. The efficiency of organic matter destruction is highly variable. Calcareous shells showed no to very low reaction to oxidizing agents and bases, but were efficiently dissolved with both tested acids at all concentrations and at all temperatures. Soft and hard tissue were most efficiently destroyed by sodium hypochlorite. However, the other reagents can also have good effects, especially by increasing the temperature to 40\\xe2\\x80\\x9350\\xc2\\xb0C. The additional temperature increase to 60\\xe2\\x80\\x9370\\xc2\\xb0C showed a further but less effective improvement, compared to the initial temperature increase. The resistance of tested polymer types can be rated as good except for polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate. Increasing the concentrations and temperatures, however, results in accelerated degradation of all polymers. This is most evident for polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate, which show losses in weight between 15 and 100% when the digestion temperature is increased. This effect is most pronounced for polyamide in the presence of acids and for polyethylene terephthalate digested with bases. As a concluding recommendation the selection of the appropriate digestion method should be specifically tested within initial pre-tests to account for the specific composition of the sample matrix and the project objectives.\",\"citedby-count\":\"39\",\"authkeywords\":\"biogenic organic matter | digestion efficiency | microplastics | protocol evaluation | sample purification | synthetic polymer resistance\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098332487\",\"dc:title\":\"Characteristics of mangrove ecosystems in Weda Bay: Environment, Vegetation, and Aboveground Carbon Stocks\",\"dc:creator\":\"Suyadi \",\"prism:publicationName\":\"IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-21\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1088/1755-1315/618/1/012021\",\"dc:description\":\"Weda Bay is one of the largest mangrove habitat in North Maluku and one of mega-biodiversity spots in Indonesia. However, data and information of mangrove vegetation and its ecosystem services particularly carbon stocks were limited. Mangroves were mapped using GIS-remote sensing and vegetation were sampled using transects in five sites of mangroves across Weda Bay. Tansects were extended from seaward to landward to cover all vegetation variation and hydrodynamic conditions. Environmental data (water and substrate): temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), particle size of sediment, and nutrient (phosphate and nitrate) were collected. The objective is to identify characteristics of mangrove landscape and vegetation, it is environment, and it ecosystem services in term of aboveground carbon stocks. The study showed that the characteristics of landscape and vegetation of mangrove varied among hydrodynamic conditions. The bay is important habitat for 8.5% (17 species) of mangrove species in Indonesia. Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza were the most dominant mangroves. The environmental conditions of Weda Bay particularly northern part of the bay were suitable for mangrove growth. Substrate of mangrove did not vary significantly with distance from the seaward which was mainly dominated by mud and clay (3.9 - 63 \\xce\\xbcm). Mean water temperature in the mangrove area was 29.3\\xc2\\xb0C, salinity 34.1 psu, mean water suspension was 46 mg l-1, mean dissolved oxygen was 3.2 mg l-1, and water current was 10 m s-1. Aboveground carbon stock was considerable (752 \\xc2\\xb1 17.6 Mg C ha-1). Change in aboveground carbon stocks over the distance from the seaward edge to landward edge was not significantly different. In contrast, aboveground carbon stocks varied among hydrodynamic conditions: estuarine, delta, and riverine mangroves. Delta mangrove contained the highest carbon stock (993 \\xc2\\xb1 27.7 Mg C ha-1), followed by estuarine mangroves (645 \\xc2\\xb1 12.2 Mg C ha-1) and riverine mangroves (244 \\xc2\\xb1 8.6 Mg C ha-1). However, this ecosystem faced some threats such as mangrove extraction and plastic pollution. Better mangrove management e.g. reducing mangrove extraction and pollution are required to protect the functions and ecosystem services of mangroves.

Many previous researches have carried out the movement of debris in the Bali Strait using numerical model to find out the source and location of the marine debris, however it only carried out local simulations within the Bali Strait. This study aims to determine the movement of debris that reaches the Bali Strait assuming debris originates from coastal areas on south and west coast of Sumatra and Java during the western monsoon (December 2018 - February 2019). The Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) model is used to obtain circulation of current patterns and debris particles movement patterns using the Lagrangian Particle Tracking module. The verification result of the model current pattern and field data using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equation. In the u velocity component the RMSE value is 0.014 m/s with a correlation of 0.968 and the v velocity component is 0.011 m/s with a correlation of 0.945. In general, the current pattern in the waters of southern of Sumatra Island to Java Island in the dominant western monsoon moves eastward due to the influence of western monsoon. The simulation results show particles that reached the Bali Strait as much as 3.47% originating only from the coastal waters of East Java.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Bali Strait | FVCOM | lagrange | marine debris\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091207675\",\"dc:title\":\"Determination of microplastic content in seafood: An integrated approach combined with the determination of elemental contaminants\",\"dc:creator\":\"Bitencourt G.R.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-20\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142301\",\"dc:description\":\"A method for the determination of microplastic (MP) content in seafood is proposed based on the selective digestion of seafood without the degradation of MP.

The heating program was 20 min, which represents a significant reduction in the time normally reported in the literature for MP analysis (from few hours up to 3 days). The proposed method allowed gravimetric determination of eight plastic types (polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, polypropylene, high and low density polyethylene, polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride) with particle size \\xe2\\x89\\xa50.3 mm. Up to 2 g of an in natura seafood sample (shark species, acoupa weakfish, tuna fish, trahira, and pink shrimp) were efficiently digested, which opened the possibility of using the proposed digestion method for determining elemental contaminants (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Thus, as the main feature of the proposed digestion method is the possibility of determining MP and elemental contaminants using the same digestion protocol, saves time and reagents and provides accurate and precise information about different classes of marine pollutants (MP and elemental contaminants).\",\"citedby-count\":\"4\",\"authkeywords\":\"Diluted acid | Marine pollutants | Microplastics | Microwave-assisted wet digestion | Seafood | Single reaction chamber\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089581777\",\"dc:title\":\"Marine hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria breakdown poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)\",\"dc:creator\":\"Denaro R.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-20\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141608\",\"dc:description\":\"Pollution of aquatic ecosystems by plastic wastes poses severe environmental and health problems and has prompted scientific investigations on the fate and factors contributing to the modification of plastics in the marine environment. Here, we investigated, by means of microcosm studies, the role of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), the main constituents of plastic bottles, in the marine environment. To this aim, different bacterial consortia, previously acclimated to representative hydrocarbons fractions namely, tetradecane (aliphatic fraction), diesel (mixture of hydrocarbons), and naphthalene/phenantrene (aromatic fraction), were used as inocula of microcosm experiments, in order to identify peculiar specialization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation. Upon formation of a mature biofilm on the surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films, the bacterial biodiversity and degradation efficiency of each selected consortium was analyzed. Notably, significant differences on biofilm biodiversity were observed with distinctive hydrocarbons-degraders being enriched on poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface, such as Alcanivorax, Hyphomonas, and Cycloclasticus species. Interestingly, ATR-FTIR analyses, supported by SEM and water contact angle measurements, revealed major alterations of the surface chemistry and morphology of PET films, mainly driven by the bacterial consortia enriched on tetradecane and diesel. Distinctive signatures of microbial activity were the alteration of the FTIR spectra as a consequence of PET chain scission through the hydrolysis of the ester bond, the increased sample hydrophobicity as well as the formation of small cracks and cavities on the surface of the film. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that hydrocarbons-degrading marine bacteria have the potential to degrade poly(ethylene terephthalate), although their degradative activity could potentially trigger the formation of harmful microplastics in the marine environment.\",\"citedby-count\":\"32\",\"authkeywords\":\"Marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria | Marine plastic pollution | Poly(ethylene terephthalate) biodegradation\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089532503\",\"dc:title\":\"Microplastics in sediments from Amazon rivers, Brazil\",\"dc:creator\":\"Gerolin C.R.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-20\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141604\",\"dc:description\":\"We assessed the concentrations of microplastics in sediment samples collected in seven sites from Solim\\xc3\\xb5es, Negro and Amazon rivers, upstream and downstream the metropolitan region of Manaus.

Plastic and microplastic waste has a negative environmental, social, and economic impact, e.g., causing injury/death to marine organisms and entering the food chain, which leads to health problems. The development of solutions and methods to mitigate marine (micro)plastic pollution is in high demand. There is a knowledge gap in this field, reason why research on this thematic is increasing.

This study investigated EPS secretion by four phytoplankton species following exposure to various concentrations of polystyrene nano- and microplastics (55 nm nanoparticles; 1 and 6 \\xce\\xbcm microparticles). The 55 nm nanoparticles induced less growth/survival (determined on a DNA basis) and produced EPS with higher protein-to-carbohydrate (P/C) ratios than the exposure to microplastic particles. The amount of DNA from the four marine phytoplankton showed a higher negative linear correlation with increasing P/C ratios, especially in response to nanoplastic exposure. These results provide evidence that marine phytoplankton are quite sensitive to smaller-sized plastics and actively modify their EPS chemical composition to cope with the stress from pollution. Furthermore, the release of protein-rich EPS was found to facilitate aggregate formation and surface modification of plastic particles, thereby affecting their fate and colonization. Overall, this work offers new insights into the potential harm of different-sized plastic particles and a better understanding of the responding mechanism of marine phytoplankton for plastic pollution.

Currently, more than 96 % of MPs studies are related to marine systems. However, the majority of marine MPs pollution has been confirmed to originate from land-based sources, evidence of MPs in the terrestrial system cannot be overlooked. In this manuscript, up-to-date knowledge regarding the sources and occurrence of MPs from the terrestrial system is comprehensively reviewed. According to the different studies both in China and abroad, microfibers derived from textile washing attributed approximately 35 % of the MPs identified in the aquatic system. Additionally, personal care and cosmetic products, tires, agricultural plastic films, artificial turfs and road paints, landfill, littering, packaging and construction industry can also release MPs to the environment. The aquatic system plays an important role in MPs transport. By using a one-way ANOVA test, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) accounted for significantly higher percentages than other polymer compositions in surface water. Polyamide (PA) and PP accounted for the majority of polymers in soils. PP, PE, and polystyrene (PS) presented an overwhelming proportion in sediment. Atmospheric deposition presents a new vehicle for entering into the wider environment. More research is urgently required on the topic of exposure risk of atmospheric MPs via inhalation. Morphological characteristics including shapes, sizes, and colors have been discussed among waters, soils, sediments and airborne. These source-occurrence implications continuum summaries can bring us new insights that we cannot underestimate the severity of MPs from land-based sources and should pay more attention to MPs contamination in the terrestrial ecosystem.\",\"citedby-count\":\"149\",\"authkeywords\":\"Land-based sources | Microplastics | Polymer-shape-size-color configurations | Terrestrial occurrence\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086701388\",\"dc:title\":\"Acute and chronic effects of polystyrene microplastics on brine shrimp: First evidence highlighting the molecular mechanism through transcriptome analysis\",\"dc:creator\":\"Suman T.Y.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Journal of Hazardous Materials\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-05\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123220\",\"dc:description\":\"Microplastics contamination is one of the leading environmental catastrophes for the marine ecosystem, but the molecular toxicity mechanism of those microplastics remains elusive. This study aims to determine the acute and chronic toxicity after exposure to polystyrene microplastics in brine shrimp with various concentrations. Our results demonstrated that acute exposure to polystyrene microplastics induced no significant effects on the survival of brine shrimp. Interestingly, the concentration-dependent increase in both bioaccumulation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed after acute and chronic exposure. Moreover, the histopathology analysis revealed the deformation of epithelial cells in the midgut region after both acute exposures at 100 mg/L and chronic exposure at 1 mg/L to polystyrene microplastics. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of microplastics-mediated toxicity, the transcriptome analysis was performed after chronic exposure, and the result showed 721 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 156 known KEGG pathways. 292 DEGs genes were significantly upregulated and 429 genes were significantly downregulated. The transcriptome analysis further revealed the DEGs related pathways. Taken together, this study not only highlighted the negative effects but also provided detailed sequencing data from transcriptome profiling to enhance our understanding of the molecular toxicity of polystyrene microplastics in brine shrimp.\",\"citedby-count\":\"70\",\"authkeywords\":\"Artemia salina | Bioaccumulation | Molecular toxicology | Polystyrene microplastics | Transcriptome\"}]}}'\n","Total results: 4560\n","          Author                                              Title  Year  \\\n","0   Abolfathi S.

Some more buoyant plastics accumulate in the water column, whereas other heavier types sink to the bottom. Consequently, the presence of microplastics can threaten organisms living in the water column as well as those found in the benthic zone. In this study, the filter feeder Daphnia has been found to ingest microplastics as the particle diameter (< 30 \\xc2\\xb5m) is within their edible particle size range and they are unable to differentiate between particles of different natures. Four different treatments were considered: food only; only microplastic particles; 50% food and 50% microplastic particles; neither food nor microplastics. Sinking microplastics have been found to decrease Daphnia magna individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 swimming velocity during vertical or cruising swimming trajectories, therefore demonstrating the sublethal effects microplastics have on this organism. In addition, microplastics decreased their body growth and survival rates. In cases with the presence of only microplastics, the swimming trajectories of Daphnia indicated the most serious stress experienced as individuals reversed vertical or cruising swimming trajectories to hopping and sinking movements. Therefore, Daphnia individuals in freshwater systems polluted by microplastics might take on the role of ingesting them and later on transporting them to deeper layer water column. In this way microplastics that would remain in the water column for a long time due to their buoyancy, might accumulate at the bottom of the water column.\",\"citedby-count\":\"8\",\"authkeywords\":\"Body growth rate | Daphnia magna | Microplastic | Mortality | Toxicity | Transport mechanisms\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122479544\",\"dc:title\":\"Stopping Macroplastic and Microplastic Pollution at Source by Installing Novel Technologies in River Estuaries and Waste Water Treatment Plants: The CLAIM Project\",\"dc:creator\":\"Gkanasos A.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Frontiers in Marine Science\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2021-12-24\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.3389/fmars.2021.738876\",\"dc:description\":\"Marine pollution from debris is a major issue nowadays, since every year large amounts of litter enter into the sea. Under the Horizon 2020 framework and within the Cleaning Litter by developing and Applying Innovative Methods in European Seas (CLAIM) project, innovative devices were designed, developed, tested and applied in laboratory and in the field. These consisted of a system named CLEAN TRASH for the prevention of macrolitter in river estuaries before entering the Sea and a filtering system for microplastics (MPs), to be placed at waste water treatment plants (WWTP). Laboratory experiments showed that macrolitters were blocked by 90% by the CLEAN TRASH system, while during the sea testing period at the Kifissos river estuary, a significant source of terrestrial based litter for the Saronikos Gulf, a total amount of 1,175 kg of litter was collected in 38 days before entering the sea, of which the 708 kg (60%) were plastic debris of various sizes and another 164 kg (14%) of styrofoam parts. The lab scale prototype of the filtering system for MPs had an efficiency of about 95%. The upscaled device was tested at the Megara WWTP and was able to withhold a significant amount of MPs. The theoretical contribution of such devices toward the reduction of plastic pollution in the Saronikos Gulf area and the Natura conservation areas therein, was also studied with the use of a 3-D coupled Hydrodynamic-Lagrangian litter tracking model. In all experiments performed, the installation of the above devices for a period of 2 years, resulted in a microplastics reduction by about 87% and a macroplastics reduction ranging from 13 to 43%, depending on the sources.\",\"citedby-count\":\"6\",\"authkeywords\":\"CLEAN TRASH | Lagrangian plastic dispersion model | macroplastics | marine pollution | microplastics | prefiltering system | waste water treatment plant\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122285652\",\"dc:title\":\"COVID-19 Generated Personal Protective Equipment: Sources of Microplastics and Pathogen Vectors in Marine Environments?\",\"dc:creator\":\"Noman M.A.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Frontiers in Marine Science\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2021-12-22\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.3389/fmars.2021.798047\",\"dc:description\":\"The world has already experienced the severe adverse effects of COVID-19 at every level. When it became understood that the COVID-19 infection is spread in the community via respiratory transmission from humans, then the widespread use of plastic-made personal protective equipments (PPEs) like face masks and hand gloves tremendously increased throughout the world. Although it has reduced the spreading of virus, however, careless disposal or mismanagement of these single use PPEs has created another major concern for the environment, as plastics are a known source of environmental contamination. On one hand, they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, while on the other, they act as a carrier or vector or pathway for other pathogens or diseases, and hence can increase the degree of continuing the pandemic. Besides, there might be a chance that plastics or microplastics may be responsible for introducing new pathogenic viruses or bacteria to humankind.

To gain the comprehensive understanding of oceanic microplastic contamination as a key global environmental problem, Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were conducted to evaluate the transport of microplastics (MPs) derived from the four major rivers that have been known to discharge large amounts of plastic waste into the South China Sea (SCS). We carried out two types of experiments using a pre-computed 3D current climatological oceanic model: (1) 2D tracking of MP particles placed at the surface to represent positively buoyant (light) MPs, and (2) fully 3D tracking of neutrally buoyant MP particles that are passively transported by ambient current. The seasonally varying monsoons in the SCS were found to provoke strong seasonal variability in the river-derived MP transport. It was found that a large number of MPs, especially from south China, are transported to the East China Sea in the seasons when the southwesterly monsoon prevails. Moreover, the difference in the density of MPs substantially affects their oceanic transport patterns.

Conversely, when the beach sediments remain exposed during long periods, the plastic debris accumulates considerably. Nevertheless, the influence of wind intensity on plastic debris transport was comparatively negligible. In other words, in our study the water flow had a greater capacity to remobilize and transport plastic debris than the wind. The most abundant mesoplastic items were foam, hard plastic, film and small fragments of fishing line. The dominant macroplastic items recorded were pieces of fishing line (nylon) and cigarette filters (cellulose acetate), typically discarded by beach users.

The abundance and morphology of MPs (size, shape, and texture) in muscle and intestinal were investigated by micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (\\xce\\xbc-FT-IR) and atomic force microscope (AFM). ICP-OES was used to investigate the adsorption/leaching of trace metals in microplastics in order to assess health risk for adults and children.

Researchers have recently focused their attention on the world\\'s largest gulf, the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), to determine and assess the impact of microplastic pollution on various environmental compartments (i.e., water, sediment, and biota). This paper critically reviews the analytical methodologies as well as summarizes the distribution, accumulation, sources, and composition of microplastics in a handful of studies (n = 14) conducted in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) covering countries like the USA (n = 10) and Mexico (n = 4). Current quality control measures with respect to sampling and microplastic extraction are summarized. Of 14 studies reviewed, 47% primarily focused on examining sediments for microplastics, with biota and water comprising 35% and 18%, respectively. The abundance ranged from 31.7 to 1392 items m\\xe2\\x88\\x922 and 60\\xe2\\x80\\x931940 items kg\\xe2\\x88\\x921 in sediment, 12\\xe2\\x80\\x93381 particles L\\xe2\\x88\\x921 in water, and 1.31\\xe2\\x80\\x934.7 particles per fish in biota. Irregular shaped fragments were the most abundant, followed by fiber, film, foam, hard, and beads etc. Different polymer types of microplastics have been found, including polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, nylon, and rayon etc. According to published research, 46 out of 100 fish thriving in this region are susceptible to microplastic ingestion. Although microplastic concentration in the GoM is among the highest found worldwide, the determination of microplastic contamination is still a growing field of research and methodological discrepancies largely limit the realization of establishing a baseline information on the microplastic abundance of the GoM. In this respect, considerable efforts must be dedicated towards evaluating their distribution and exposure levels; thereby, major challenges and future research directions are briefly discussed.\",\"citedby-count\":\"17\",\"authkeywords\":\"Fish | Gulf of Mexico | Marine | Microplastics | Sediment | Water\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114633340\",\"dc:title\":\"Adsorption mechanism of two pesticides on polyethylene and polypropylene microplastics: DFT calculations and particle size effects\",\"dc:creator\":\"Mo Q.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Environmental Pollution\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2021-12-15\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118120\",\"dc:description\":\"Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) microplastics (MPs), as carriers, can bind with pesticides, which propose harmful impacts to aqueous ecosystems. Meanwhile, carbofuran and carbendazim (CBD), two widely used carbamate pesticides, are toxic to humans because of the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity. The interaction between two MPs and two pesticides could start in farmland and be maintained during transportation to the ocean. Herein, the adsorption behavior and mechanism of carbofuran and carbendazim (CBD) by PE and PP MPs were investigated via characterization and density functional theory (DFT) simulation. The adsorption kinetic and thermodynamic data were best described by pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Freundlich models. The adsorption behaviors of individual carbofuran/CBD on both MPs were very similar. The CBD adsorption rate and capacity of PE and PP MPs were higher than those of carbofuran. This phenomenon explained the lower negative effects of DOM (oxalic acid, glycine (Gly)) on CBD adsorption relative to those of carbofuran. The presence of oxalic acid and Gly decreased the PE adsorption by 20.40\\xe2\\x80\\x9348.02% and the PP adsorption by 19.27\\xe2\\x80\\x9342.11%, respectively. It indicated the significance of DOM in carbofuran cycling. The adsorption capacities were negatively correlated with MPs size, indicating the importance of specific surficial area. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy before and after adsorption suggested that the adsorption process did not produce any new covalent bond. Instead, intermolecular van der Waals forces were one of the primary adsorption mechanisms of carbofuran and CBD by MPs, as evidenced by DFT calculations. Based on the zeta potential, the electrostatic interaction explained the higher adsorption CBD by MPs than carbofuran.\",\"citedby-count\":\"30\",\"authkeywords\":\"Agriculture film | Carbendazim | Carbofuran | Density functional theory | Dissolved organic matter\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113270658\",\"dc:title\":\"Unique metalloid uptake on microplastics: The interaction between boron and microplastics in aquatic environment\",\"dc:creator\":\"Wang H.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2021-12-15\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149668\",\"dc:description\":\"Boron pollution in the aquatic environment has a hazardous effect on human health and the ecosystem as a metalloid pollutant, and few researchers have focused on the potential interaction between boron and microplastics. We investigated the adsorption of boron on four types of microplastics (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), aged PVC, polystyrene (PS), and aged PS). The adsorption behavior was explored by kinetics, isotherm models, and several aqueous factors, including pH, humic acid, ionic strength (Na+), metal ion types (Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Al3+), and the seawater environment. The adsorption capacities on microplastics were followed: aged PVC (0.91 mg/g) > aged PS (0.197 mg/g) > virgin PVC (0.1 mg/g) > virgin PS (0.005 mg/g). The adsorption kinetics and isotherm models suggested monolayer adsorption and chemisorption. Humic acid and high pH significantly inhibited the adsorption due to the complexation and hydrolysis of boric acid (B(OH)3), respectively. The presence of metal ions may enhance or hinder adsorption, depending on the boron species, ion concentration, ion type, and microplastics categories. The unique interaction mainly depended on surface complexations of B(OH)3 with oxygen-containing groups on microplastics surface. Because aged microplastics have more oxygen-containing groups, they can combine more B(OH)3, and PVC can adsorb more boron due to the C\\xe2\\x80\\x93Cl bond and surface diffusion. In the aquatic environment, however, metal ions may occupy these binding sites, and the electrostatic force between borate ([B(OH)4]\\xe2\\x88\\x92) and microplastics will take precedence. In the simulated intestines of warm-blooded animals, we achieved the greatest boron desorption ratio on microplastics.

The experimental results showed that ASA had the highest removal efficiency (54.70%) under conventional dosage, while PAM achieved the best removal effect (91.45%) at high dosage. Mechanism of coagulation was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results illustrated that when only PAC existed or the dosage of coagulant aids was low, double layer compression was the main principle. The increase of coagulant aids dosage improved the effect of adsorption and sweep flocculation significantly. Moreover, jar tests carried in different conditions demonstrated that the current coagulation systems were highly adaptable.\",\"citedby-count\":\"28\",\"authkeywords\":\"Adsorption | Double layer compression | Enhanced coagulation | Microplastics removal | Sweep flocculation\"}]}}'\n","Total results: 1829\n","         Author                                              Title  Year  \\\n","0  Markose V.J.
