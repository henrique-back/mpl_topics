However, the global occurrence characteristics, environmental risks, driving factors, and source-sink relationships remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 165 articles about marine MP pollution. It was found that the global marine MP abundance displayed a significant spatial heterogeneity, and the distribution pattern was influenced by offshore distance, population density, and economic development. The morphological characteristics of MPs showed a significant difference between seawater and marine sediment, and small-size MPs (<1 mm) accounted for the majority of all MPs in the marine environment. The environmental risk assessment revealed that most of the marine MP pollution still remains at low concentrations in the global context, with the Polyurethane (PU), Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) types of MPs showing high environmental-risk contributions. In addition, land-based waste and marine operations, which were considered to be the dominant sources of marine MPs, primarily aggregated at nearshore submarine areas, in the water column, and in the deep-sea bottom environment. This study suggested that the combination of a meta-analysis and Monte Carlo simulation can provide much valuable information regarding the global occurrence characteristics and environmental risks of marine MPs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd', ""The widespread use of plastic has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste across a range of sizes, notably including microplastics (MPs). The introduction of MPs into aquatic ecosystems can lead to the contamination of organisms, mainly fish. This study reports for the first time a quantitative and qualitative analysis conducted on the abundance of MPs encountered in water and sediment of milkfish aquaculture ponds in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Water and sediment samples were collected at three stations between February to April 2021. The abundance of MPs was analyzed through the application of one-way ANOVA tests and Pearson's correlation analysis. The results identified four types of MPs: fragments, fibers, films, and pellets. The highest abundance of MPs in both water (10.40 particle/L) and sediment samples (1.15 particle/g) was observed in March. The predominant MPs size in the water samples is 100–500 μm, while it is below 100 μm in the sediment. The color of the MPs varied across eight colors: black, purple, red, blue, yellow, pink, green, and transparent. The identification of MPs polymers was found to be polypropylene (PP), Polyurethane (PU), Polycarbonate (PC), Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The presence of MPs in the water column and sediments was correlated with human activities around the ponds. Hence, the abundance of MPs is a source of pollution that has the potential to damage the nutritional quality of farmed milkfish. This study provides important information for the local governments to develop waste management policies for a cleaner environment and improved human health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."", ""An emerging concern of today's world, due to their universal dispersion worldwide, is the environment's microplastic pollution. The Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove, have unique and dynamic environmental settings with numerous pollution risk exposures, including microplastics (MPs). Thus, the present study has focused on the MP pollution in water, sediment, and fish samples of the Sundarbans of Bangladesh for the first time. Water and sediment samples were collected (n = 30/each) from sampling locations along the Pasur river (Bangladesh). Furthermore, nine species of fish samples were collected from a local fish market situated at the Mongla port. Results show that 100 % of the analyzed samples have evidence of MPs. On average, 2.66 × 103 plastic particles/L and 1.57 × 105 particles/kg were found in water and sediment samples, respectively. Furthermore, results show a higher number of MPs in the animals' gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (10.41 particles/g), concerning the average concentration recorded in the muscles (4.68 particles/g). O. pama and H. nehereus were the species that showed the highest MPs accumulation in the GIT. In the muscles, the highest MP levels were observed in T. ilisha and L. calcarifer. Most of the particles were smaller than 1 mm; black-colored particles dominated the pool. FT-IR analysis revealed the presence of seven polymer types where polyamide was abundant in water and sediment samples. SEM analysis showed morphological structures and adsorbed particles on the surface of plastic samples, and the spatial distribution of MPs indicates that the location with high human intervention has elevated levels of MPs. Therefore, our study demonstrates that Sundarbans mangrove forests are highly contaminated with MPs and that its fisheries can be a potential source of human exposure to these pollutants. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.""]"

As microplastics contaminate both water and sediments, research on their spatial distribution in these different environmental matrices has increased. However, fresh waters are poorly studied and even less so are lentic ecosystems. To contribute filling this knowledge gap, this study analyses the distribution of microplastics in the water column and surface sediments of a volcanic lake, namely Lake Bracciano. Furthermore, it analyses in more detail the relationship between the concentration of microplastics in sediments, its grain size and the sampling depth (i.e. nearshore or deep). Water and sediment sampling was carried out in different sectors of the lake (northern, eastern, southern, western) using a plankton net and a van Veen grab sampler, respectively. Two sediment samples were collected at each station in order to analyse the abundance of microplastic and to perform grain size analysis. Results show a mean concentration of 2.4 items m−3 in water and 42 items kg−1 in sediments. The distribution of microplastics is uneven between the different sampling stations, with the northern sector being the most contaminated in both matrices. The chemical composition and shape of microplastics vary between water and sediment. In particular, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride are the most abundant polymers in water and sediments, respectively. Fibres are the main shape of microplastics in water while fragments are more abundant in sediments. In-depth analysis of sediment shows that sediments from deep stations are more contaminated than nearshore samples and have more fragment-shaped microplastics than fibre-shaped ones. Furthermore, there is a significant positive correlation between the concentration of microplastics and the abundance of silt, confirming data emerging from the scientific literature on marine and lotic ecosystems. © 2022', 'Currently, plastic pollutants in the aquatic environment have received much attention. The studies on the abundance of microplastics in the river system are consequently lower compared to the studies on the marine system. The study aimed to determine the abundance of microplastics in water and riverbank sediments of Miri River and classify their spatial distribution patterns. In this study, water and sediment samples were collected from five sampling points in Miri River to investigate the abundance and distribution of microplastics as well as the characteristics of microplastics in Miri River. The abundance of microplastics in water samples was within the range of 0.8 to 2.1\xa0mg/L or 10.7 to 14.3 particle /L. In sediment samples, the abundance of microplastics was within the range of 26.2 to 62.5\xa0mg/kg or 283.7 to 456.2 particle/kg. The main type of microplastics detected in both water and sediment samples was fragment type with proportions of 57.3% and 57.9%, respectively. The most abundance particle size of microplastics was size of less than 1\xa0mm. Colored microplastics such as black and blue were mainly found in both water samples and sediment samples. The polymer types were identified using FTIR which were polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, ethylene propylene diene monomer, Butyl-Branham, and ethylene vinyl acetate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.', 'Microplastic pollution in the Yangtze River Basin has become a major concern; however, the variations in different environmental compartments are unknown. Here, we compiled published information including detection methods, occurrence, and characterization of microplastics from 624 sampling sites in river water, river sediment, lake and reservoir water, and lake and reservoir sediment in the Yangtze River Basin. The spatial distribution of sampling sites shows fractal pattern and was uniformly concentrated around the main stream of the Yangtze River and the lake geographical zone. Collection, pretreatment, identification, and quantification processes varied among different studies. Non-parametric tests were performed to compare the different microplastic indices. A Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the relationship between microplastic pollution and local socioeconomic conditions. We found that the microplastic size and abundance distribution in river water and lake and reservoir water showed different patterns for different sampling methods, indicating that different methods influenced the results. Population density and urbanization rate are suggested to be important factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of microplastic abundances in water, rather than in sediment. The microplastic abundances in lake and reservoir water were higher than that in river water in bulk samples. However, microplastic abundances among different sediment environments shows no significant difference. For bulk water samples and sediment samples overall, the proportion of small microplastics (<1 mm, i.e. SMP), fibers, transparent debris, and polypropylene (PP) were 65.1%, 67.8%, 31.8%, and 29.7%, respectively. The microplastic characteristics of lake and reservoir water and sediment were similar, differing from those of river water and sediment.

2,1,861,1_exposure_effects_ps_mps,1: Toxicity and Effects of Micro- and Nanoplastics on Marine Organisms,"['exposure', 'effects', 'ps', 'mps', 'microplastics', 'nps', 'exposed', 'toxicity', 'organisms', 'marine']","['Nowadays, the occurrence of a large volume of plastic litter in oceanic and coastal zones has increased concern about its impacts on marine organisms. The degradation of plastic polymers leads to the formation of smaller fragments at both micro and nano scale (<5 mm and <1 μm respectively). Nanoplastics (NPs), due to their smaller size and high specific surface area can establish colloidal interactions with marine microalgae, therefore potential toxicity can be led. To assess this hypothesis, the aim of the present study is to examine the behaviour of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) of different sizes (50 and 100 nm) in marine water and their possible effects at different physiological and cellular levels in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Different biomarkers and stress responses in P. tricornutum were analysed when organisms were exposed to environmentally relevant PS NPs concentrations between 0.1 and 50 mg L−1. Our results showed significant differences between controls and exposure microalgae, indicating toxicity. After 24 h, an increase in oxidative stress biomarkers, damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, DNA damage and depolarization of mitochondrial and cell membrane from 5 mg L−1 were observed. Further after 72 h the inhibition of population growth and chlorophyll content were observed. Examining effects the effects related to PS NPs size, the smallest (50 nm) induced greater effects at 24 h while bigger PS NPs (100 nm) at72 h. This bigger particles (100 nm) showed more stability (in size distribution and spherical form) in the different culture media assayed, when compared with the rest of particles used. Strong adsorption and/or internalization of PS NPs was confirmed through changes in cell complexity and cell size as well as the fluorescence of 100 nm fluoresbrite PS NPs after washing cell surface. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd', 'It has been well documented that micro- and nanoplastics are emerging pollutants in aquatic environments, and their potential toxic effects has attracted widespread concerns. Here, we evaluated the adverse effects of dietary polystyrene nanoplastics and microplastics (PS-N/MPs) on growth performance, oxidative stress induction, immune response, ammonia detoxification, and bacterial pathogen resistance of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. After collection and acclimation, sea cucumbers were randomized into 3 groups (i.e., control, 100 nm PS-NPs and 20 µm PS-MPs at 100 mg kg−1 diet) for 60-day feeding experiment. Every group contained 360 sea cucumbers which were equally divided into 3 aquaria as biological triplicates. The results showed that the specific growth rate and final weight of the sea cucumbers fed with diets containing PS-N/MPs were significantly lower than those of control group. Dietary virgin PS-N/MPs significantly increased the reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content in coelomic fluid, causing oxidative stress and damage to the growth and development of A. japonicus. During the experiment, 100 nm PS-NPs significantly induced the depletion in cellular and humoral immune parameters. The calculated IBR values based on multi-level biomarkers revealed the size-dependent toxic differences of PS-NPs > PS-MPs. The relative expression levels of GDH and GS mRNA showed first rise and then fall trends after exposure to ammonia, and 100 nm PS-NPs had a more profound impact on suppressing ammonia detoxification compared with 20 µm PS-MPs. Moreover, the expression of Hsp90, Hsp70, CL, TLR, and CASP2 genes were all down-regulated by ammonia exposure. Taken together of IBR results, ammonia stress test and pathogen challenge, we deduced that dietary 100 nm PS-NPs are more potentially hazardous than 20 µm PS-MPs. These findings provide valuable information for understanding the size-dependent toxic effects of PS-N/MPs and early risk warning on marine invertebrates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.', 'Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants in the global marine environment. However, few studies have adequately explored the different toxic mechanisms of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in aquatic organisms. The sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, is a key organism in the marine benthic ecosystem due to its crucial roles in biogeochemical cycles and food web. This study investigated the bioaccumulation and adverse effects of polystyrene micro- and nanoplastics (PS-M/NPs) of different sizes (20 μm, 1 μm and 80 nm) in the regenerated intestine of A. japonicus using multi-omics analysis. The results showed that after 30-day exposure at the concentration of 0.1 mg L−1, PS-MPs and PS-NPs accumulated to 155.41–175.04 μg g−1 and 337.95 μg g−1, respectively. This excessive accumulation led to increased levels of antioxidases (SOD, CAT, GPx and T-AOC) and reduced activities of immune enzymes (AKP, ACP and T-NOS), indicating oxidative damage and compromised immunity in the regenerated intestine. PS-NPs had more profound negative impacts on cell proliferation and differentiation compared to PS-MPs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PS-NPs primarily affected pathways related to cellular components, e.g., ribosome, and oxidative phosphorylation. In comparison, PS-MPs had greater influences on actin-related organization and organic compound metabolism. In the PS-M/NPs-treated groups, differentially expressed metabolites were mainly amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol phospholipid, and purine nucleosides. Additionally, microbial community reconstruction in the regenerated intestine was severely disrupted by the presence of PS-M/NPs. In the PS-NPs group, Burkholderiaceae abundance significantly increased while Rhodobacteraceae abundance decreased. Correlation analyses demonstrated that intestinal regeneration of A. japonicus was closely linked to its enteric microorganisms. These microbiota-host interactions were notably affected by different PS-M/NPs, with PS-NPs exposure causing the most remarkable disruption of mutual symbiosis. The multi-omic approaches used here provide novel insights into the size-dependent toxicity of PS-M/NPs and highlight their detrimental effects on invertebrates in M/NPs-polluted marine benthic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd']"

Still, around 50% of the plastic produced is disposable products that generate substantial waste. Several reports pointed out the adverse effects of plastic litter in coastal environments in recent years, emphasizing single-use plastics (SUP). In this manner, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) coastal environments are highly vulnerable due to wastewater treatment facilities scarcity and poor plastic waste management strategies. Since COVID-19 pandemic, the single-use plastic waste/person rate is expected to rise due to the use of personal protective equipment and SUP as health care measures. Based on literature research and the review of plastic waste regulations, this paper will assess the main COVID-19 plastic pollution threats and LAC beaches' regulations to suggest possible measures to abate this problem. The main findings suggest that unifying the ongoing fragmented and overlapped policies is key to abate plastic pollution, including plastic industry regulations and circular economies. In addition, increasing public risk perception about plastic pollution is critical to reducing plastic waste generation. Research advances in the adverse effects of plastic debris could improve the public's perception of plastic pollution risk, pushing forward global marine plastic governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"", 'Plastic pollution is generated by the unsustainable use and disposal of plastic products in modern society, threatening economies, ecosystems, and human health. Current clean-up strategies have attempted to mitigate the negative effects of plastic pollution but are unable to compete with increasing quantities of plastic entering the environment. Thus, reducing inputs of plastic to the environment must be prioritized through a global multidisciplinary approach. Mismanaged waste is a major land-based source of plastic pollution that can be reduced through improvements in the life-cycle of plastics, especially in production, consumption, and disposal, through an Integrated Waste Management System. In this review paper, we discuss current practices to improve life cycle and waste management of plastics that can be implemented to reduce health and environmental impacts of plastics and reduce plastics pollution. Ten recommendations for stakeholders to reduce plastic pollution include (1) regulation of production and consumption; (2) eco-design; (3) increasing the demand for recycled plastics; (4) reducing the use of plastics; (5) use of renewable energy for recycling; (6) extended producer responsibility over waste; (7) improvements in waste collection systems; (8) prioritization of recycling; (9) use of bio-based and biodegradable plastics; and (10) improvement in recyclability of e-waste. © 2019 by the authors.

The marine plastic debris (MPD) has thus become one of the emerging global environmental and public health problems drawing enormous international attention recently. This article observes that international agreements do not provide sufficient and proper governance mechanisms to address plastic marine debris problems specifically. In preventing the MPD from land-based sources, a well-designed waste management legal and institutional framework with effective implementation shall be established. In this regard, Part I first explores the main features, challenges, and effectiveness of existing international legal norms aims at marine pollution prevention. In Part II, the effectiveness of the plastic waste management legal and policy framework adopted at the international level will be evaluated and critically discussed. Part III explores the critical role of national waste management by reducing the marine litter of plastic waste. A case study for Taiwan's efforts in recovering and recycling plastic waste by establishing a comprehensive waste management framework and effective plastic reduction measures implemented in Taiwan. It is worth to explore Taiwan's waste management law and policy framework and its implementation experience partially because Taiwan's experience could provide some lessons for emerging industrial countries to reduce and to dispose of plastic waste effectively. This article finds that the key to address MPD relies on effective plastic waste management globally. Part IV provides some findings and suggestions for future legal and policy development in the context of international and domestic law and policy framework. It is, however, that the ideal regulatory governance scheme to effectively addressing the issue of MPD shall adopt multiple level governance and cooperative actions involving all stakeholders. © 2020""]"

This study investigated the possibility of MPs contamination in different marine fish species with substantial commercial value that was captured off the south coast of India, from Adyar and Ennore regions. Over the course of six months, from October 2019 to March 2020, 220 fish were examined. It was discovered that the gills and guts had accumulated more numbers of MPs (1115 MPs) of which 68% were fibres and fragments. The commercial fish samples contained an average of 3.2–7.6 MPs per fish. Greater MPs pollution is seen in the Ennore regions. The prevalence of MPs was observed in carnivorous and planktivorous fish collected from both the sites. Fish guts contained the most MPs, according to the data. Pelagic fish accounted for the least amount of MPs, followed by mid- and demersal fish. Four different types of polymers were also identified in the present study: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyamide. These results clearly showed the degree of microplastic contamination in fish tissues from the south Indian coastal regions of Adyar and Ennore. These results we hope will create a baseline data for MPs contamination in commercial fish species. The presence of MPs in the fish could have detrimental effects both on the environment and human health and thus comprehensive steps are required to prevent plastic pollution of the environment in south India's coastal region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"", 'The researches on MPs in commercial marine fish are very limited although in marine environments microplastic (MPs) pollution is a global problem. In this study, the presence, composition, and characterization of MPs in different tissues (brain, gill, muscle, and gastrointestinal tract) of commercial fish species [red mullet (Mullus barbatus) and pontic shad (Alosa immaculata Bennett 1835)] from the Black Sea were investigated. M. barbatus (demersal) and A. immaculata (pelagic) fish were preferred in the selection of fish species in order to represent demersal and pelagic environments. After dissected the fish, MPs were obtained from the tissues by extraction using the flotation method; then the MPs were counted and categorized according to shape, size, and color. The composition of the MPs was determined via ATR–FTIR spectroscopy. In terms of microplastic abundance in fish tissues, the gastrointestinal tract (40.0%) ranked first in both fish species, while the lowest MPs density was determined in brain tissues (7.0%). After the gastrointestinal tissue, gills were identified as the second tissue with the highest MPs density. Regardless of fish species, MPs characterization was mainly fibrous (51.0%), black colored (49.0%), and 50–200\xa0µm in size (55.0%). Among the nine different polymers determined, polychloroprene (18.8%) and polyamide (15.0%) were found most frequently. This research provides data for tissue-based assessment of MPs in fish. The obtained data showed that MPs (one of the anthropogenic pollutants) are quite high in all tissues regardless of fish species.

Approximately 85.4% of the total fish among all species ingested MPs, and there was an average abundance of 2.14 items/individual or 0.043 items/g of wet weight. Compared with other studies, MP pollution in fishes from the Bohai Sea was relatively moderate. The MPs were predominantly fibrous in shape and were cellophane, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) in polymer composition. The highest abundance and polymer composition of MPs was observed in benthivores, suggesting that they might ingest these MPs from their food. The small fish Konosirus punctatus, which had a high level of MPs, may increase the risk of human exposure to the MPs when it is dried and consumed. Moreover, the spatial variation of MPs was determined in terms of abundance, shape composition, and major polymer types, but there was no marked relationship between MP abundance and the trophic levels of fish.

Results revealed that the composition of microplastics microbial communities varied remarkably across geographical locations and exposure times. With an increase in exposure duration, both the diversity and richness of bacterial communities colonizing microplastics significantly increased, microbial communities show adaptations to the plastisphere. The type of microplastics had a significant effect on the community structure characteristicsof bacteria attached to their surfaces, with inconsistent trends in the relative abundance of different genera on different substrates. Notably, microplastic surfaces harbored a significant abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, exemplified by Erythrobacter. These findings underscore the potential of microplastics as unique microbial niches. Meanwhile, long-term exposure experiments also offer the possibility of screening for plastic-degrading bacteria. In addition, the presence of the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio was detected in all microplastic samples, implying that microplastics could serve as carriers for pathogenic dissemination. This underscores the urgency of addressing the risk posed by the proliferation of harmful bacteria on microplastic surfaces.

In this study, the bacterial communities on MPs in the wetland ecosystem of Poyang Lake, China’s largest freshwater lake, were investigated based on 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that the bacterial communities on MPs showed a lower richness and diversity but presented a higher number of unique OTUs than the water and sediment bacterial communities. Furthermore, the structure of the bacterial communities on MPs had a higher similarity to the bacterial compositions of the sediment than of the water, indicating that sediments are an important source of bacteria for MPs. It should be noted that the MPs could enhance the exchange of bacteria between water and sediment. The bacterial composition varied significantly among different substrates and at different sampling times; nevertheless, it showed consistency on the surface of MPs at different sampling sites. Proteobacteria dominated as the most abundant bacterial phylum across all samples. At the genus level, Pseudomonas were distinctly enriched in bacterial communities on MPs. In addition, the results of pathway prediction indicated that the pathways of “human disease” from MPs bacterial communities were higher than those from water and sediment. These results illustrate that the surfaces of MPs serve as distinct habitats for specific bacteria. Environmental factors such as nitrate nitrogen, pH, and organic matter were crucial in shaping the bacterial communities.

The mean litter density was found to be 0.29 items/m2 and the beaches’ clean index ranged between ‘very clean’ and ‘dirty’. Cigarette butts (30.9%) and plastic objects (30.7%) were the most frequent marine litter items, followed by paper/cardboard (9.2%) and metal items (8.3%). The composition of the litter showed that most of the monitored marine debris has a land-based source, with a strong contribution from smoking-related activities and littering in streams. By characterizing the waste and identifying its source, it was possible to propose integrated management actions at a local level.

Therefore, a particle tracking model that included ocean surface currents, horizontal diffusion, Stokes drift, windage, and beaching/re-drifting processes was developed to reproduce the behavior of riverine plastic debris in the Indian Ocean. The modeled particles were released in the model domain based on riverine plastic debris database. The maximum abundance of beached particles occurred during the southwesterly monsoon season, particularly in the Bay of Bengal. The particles released from the rivers were trapped in the northern Indian Ocean unless both Stokes drift and windage were excluded from transportation velocity. These results suggest that the riverine plastic debris was trapped in the northern Indian Ocean until it fragmented into less buoyant small microplastics drifting in the subsurface layer, free from windage and Stokes drift at increasing depths. © 2023', 'In our modern world, plastics are everywhere in the daily life and they are also the most abundant type of litter or discarded solid waste, in particular in the marine environment. The situation results in a persistent, ubiquitous presence of plastics in the world ocean. Consequently, plastics in their different forms represents the most pressing environmental issues on the oceans and, potentially, on the human health. However, the pathways, accumulation and final destination, from the sea surface down to the sediment at the bottom floor of the oceans or along the coastlines, are partially unknown and not completely understood. Plastic pollution at sea is induced by both maritime and inland sources. The contribution of the inland source is often estimated to be 80% in comparison of the maritime contribution (UNEP source). To better quantify global plastic pollution transport and to effectively reduce sources and risks, a thorough understanding of origin, transport, fate, and input of plastic debris from rivers remains crucial. Complementing the traditional Eulerian approach, Lagrangian ocean framework is a powerful way to analyze the ocean circulation or dynamics. The main purpose is based on large sets of virtual (passive or fictive) particles whose displacements (trajectories) are integrated with the full depth or surface ocean current field. Among the expectations, questions about pathways and flow connectivity can be addressed and it avoids the classical use of passive tracer. In the generalized methodology, the analyses include the use of the ocean currents, the determination of the initial positions of the particle (knowns also as the seeding strategy) and the computation of trajectories under physical assumptions, and finally their post-treatment (qualification of their final status). The fate of floating plastic pollution discharged along the coasts has been recently studied at the global scale by comparing two seeding strategies, one based on river discharges and the other one on the mismanaged waste from coastal populations, under the same framework of a Lagrangian numerical analysis from a global ocean circulation model [1]. These latest results show that about 1/3 of the particles end up in the open ocean and 2/3 on the coastlines (as defined by the ocean model). The seeding strategy largely influences the accumulation of particles toward the main subtropical convergence zones, such as in the South Pacific and the North Atlantic, as being mostly fed by the coastal population inputs. Such study clearly highlights the importance of the initial seeding scenario and also revealed that the stranding of particles that occurs mainly locally, could have a significant long-distance impact, allowing for a certain global and basin scale connectivity. Plastic pollution from inland sources mostly enters the ocean through rivers, and a large part is coming from South-East Asian countries. In the particular case of Indonesia, several factors introduce complexity in the consideration of the marine litter problem, including a high population density, one of the highest level of rainfall in the world, with an interannual variability linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and finally a shoreline particularly jagged with approximately 13, 550 islands of various sizes with many narrow straits for a total coastline length greater than 81, 000 km (which are the reasons why Indonesia is also known as the maritime continent). A strategy for considering the global problem of marine litter at the regional scale of Indonesia should consider all these aforementioned aspects. The present study considers the dispersion of marine floating litter based on some state-of-art numerical estimations of oceanic movements and currents. The potential impacts of the windage (wind drag) but also the tides and waves effect, are investigated under a specific seeding scenario with regards to discharges of the main rivers flowing along the Indonesian coasts.  © 2021 MTS.', 'Plastic waste accumulating in the global ocean is an increasingly threatening environmental issue. To date, the floating and thus most visible fraction of ocean plastic pollution has been mapped at global scale. Yet, large knowledge gaps exist in our current understanding of the transport and transformation processes of positively buoyant plastic debris at the sea surface. Observations at sea typically report an apparent scarcity of microplastics (<5 mm) relative to the expected abundance-size distribution based on fragmentation of larger plastic objects. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the relative abundance of microplastics (>500 µm) and mesoplastics (0.5-5 cm) in the surface waters of the eastern North Pacific Ocean using data from 1136 040 plastic fragments collected by 679 neuston trawl deployments between 2015 and 2019. Our results reveal that the apparent microplastic scarcity is not uniformly distributed across the region. Instead, we show that the relative abundance of floating microplastics increases from the outside to the inside of the North Pacific Garbage Patch. We hypothesize that this observation could be explained by (i) a spatially variable microplastic removal due to spatial differences in ocean productivity, (ii) a differential dispersal of micro- vs. mesoplastics with a preferential accumulation of microplastics in the subtropical gyre, and/or (iii) the timescales associated with transport and fragmentation of plastic objects at the ocean surface with older, more degraded, floating plastic accumulation in subtropical gyres. The results presented here highlight that global estimates of the accumulation and removal of positively buoyant microplastics need to consider spatial aspects such as variations in ocean productivity, the dominant physical transport processes in a given area, as well as the time needed for a plastic object to reach the specific offshore location.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Some basic issues such as the occurrence, source, and potential risks of microplastics in the soil are still open questions. These problems arise due to the lack of systematic and comprehensive analysis of microplastic in soils. Therefore, we comprehensively reviewed the current status of knowledge on microplastics in soil on detection, occurrence, characterization, source, and potential risk. Our review suggests that microplastics are ubiquitous in soil matrices globally. However, the research progress of microplastics in the soil is restricted by inherent technological inconsistencies and difficulties in analyzing particles in complex matrices, and studies on the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in soil environments remain very scarce, especially in Africa, South America, and Oceania. The consistency of the characteristics and composition of the microplastics in the aquatic environment and soil demonstrate they may share sources and exchange microplastics. Wide and varied sources of microplastic are constantly filling the soil, which causes the accumulation of microplastics in the soil. Studies on the effects and potential risks of microplastics in soil ecosystems are also reviewed. Limited research has shown that the combination and interaction of microplastics with contaminants they absorbed may affect soil health and function, and even migration along the food chain. The occurrence and impact of microplastic on the soil depend on the morphology, chemical components, and natural factors. We conclude that large research gaps exist in the quantification and estimation of regional emissions of microplastics in soil, factors affecting the concentration of microplastics, and microplastic disguising as soil carbon storage, which need more effort. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.', 'Microplastics are ubiquitous in soil ecosystems all over the world through source and migration. It is even estimated that the content of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems exceeds the number of microplastics entering sea ecosystems. However, compared with the research on microplastics in marine ecosystems, the research and discussion on microplastics in soil ecosystems are still less. Transportation, film mulching and sewage sludge are three main sources of soil microplastics. The abundance, polymer type, size and shape of the microplastics are related to the source and they help to clarify the source. The characteristics of microplastics, farming measures, soil animal activities and other factors promote the migration of microplastics, which bring new challenges to the soil ecosystems and humans. This article summarizes the latest research findings on the effects of soil microplasticity on soil properties, plants, animals and microorganisms. The analysis methods of microplastics in soil can refer to the analysis methods of microplastics of aquatic sediments, because soil and aquatic sediments are similar, both of which are complex solid substrates. At present, the development of analytical methods is limited due to the complex matrix of soil and the small volume of microplastics, which requires continuous development and innovation. Through the summary and analysis of related articles, this article reviews the distribution, sources, migration, influence and analysis methods of soil microplastics.

In addition, soil microplastics can also directly cause toxicity to soil. The sources, migration and other environmental behavior of microplastics in soil ecosystem were summarized, and the impact of microplastics on soil ecosystem was emphasized. The results mainly include the following aspects: (1) Microplastics can migrate and transport in the soil environmental system through the space between soil particles, the root cracks of plants and the movement of animals. (2) Microplastics can affect soil physical and chemical properties, plant growth and development, animal behavior and microbial diversity. (3) Microorganisms and enzymes can degrade microplastics in the soil environment and directly reduce microplastics in the soil system, while biochar can reduce the toxicity of microplastics to the soil ecosystem.

However, microplastic pollution has not been frequently studied in the oligotrophic oceanic regions around the Xisha Islands, the largest marine coral reef area of China. In this study, microplastics in surface seawater were sampled from 30 stations in the region around the Xisha Islands. Marine microplastics were classified via a microscopic method using an Olympus stereo microscope. Microplastic photographs were taken by an inner imaging system, and the size of the microplastics was estimated using Image J software. Additionally, a portion of the microplastic samples was randomly selected for component analysis based on the shape, color, and size of the particles. Our results indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in the surface seawater of the Xisha region. The abundance of microplastics was in the range of 10-130 pieces/m3, with an average value of 54.7 pieces/m3. The size range of microplastics was 0.02-5 mm with the length of 0.02-1 mm accounting for 32.1% and the length of 1-3 mm accounting for 64.8% of the total abundance. The microplastics from the Xisha region can be classified into five color types, namely transparent, blue, black, green, and red, with the average percentages being 56.8%, 40.2%, 1.2%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, the local microplastics can be divided into fiber and film according to their morphology with fiber accounting for more than 99% of the total abundance. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) were the two major chemical components of the microplastics, accounting for 56.2% and 20.3% of the chemical components, respectively. The average concentration of microplastics in Xisha region is relatively lower than that in many other regions of the South China Sea, as well as that in other regions of the global oceans. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of microplastics is influenced by water movement, anthropogenic activities, and topographic features in the Xisha region. Although there is a large spatial variation in the surface seawater in the Xisha region, the concentration of microplastics in the near-shore stations is typically high, which may indicate that the microplastics in these areas originate from terrestrial sources. On the other hand, a reduced wave energy due to the topographic structure of shallow coral reefs allows more microplastics to settle and accumulate in the nearshore waters around the islands. Meanwhile, there were nearshore stations (S12, S19, S22) with low microplastic abundance, particularly in areas with high internal tides caused by local topography, strong mixing or upwelling induced by internal tides, and waves. These phenomena can bring subsurface waters to the surface and thus lead to the dilution of surface seawater pollutants at the nearshore stations. Analysis of microplastic morphology revealed the presence of large-diameter microplastic fibers in the surface seawater of the Xisha region, which may indicate that these microplastics are young in age. Most likely, they originated from recent fishery activities in the region, as both PET and PP are common types of plastics used in local fishery operations. Furthermore, microplastics have already been found in local soil samples and in the bodies of seabirds living on the Xisha Islands, due to an increase in island development and construction. Therefore, plastic waste discharge caused by increasing human activities may be another important source of microplastics to the surface seawater of the Xisha region. © 2020, Science Press.

Therefore, this study we investigated the abundance, distribution, characteristics, and compositions of MPs in this region. Sea surface water samples collected from 18 stations showed a microplastic concentration range of 6028–95,335 pieces/km2 and a mean concentration of 34,039 ± 25,101 pieces/km2. Highest microplastic concentrations were observed in the seamount region of western Pacific. We observed a significant positive correlation between microplastic abundance and latitude across the study region. It was observed that microplastic concentrations decreased with increasing offshore distance at sites located on a 154° W transect. Fibres/filaments were the dominant microparticles observed in this study (57.4%), followed by fragments (18.3%). The dominant particle size range was 1–2.5 mm (35.1%), followed by 0.5–1 mm (28.5%), and the dominant particle colour was white (33.8%), followed by transparent (31.0%) and green (24.6%). The most common polymer identified by μ-Raman was polypropylene (39.1%), followed by polymethyl methacrylate (16.2%), polyethylene (14.1%) and polyethylene terephthalate (14.2%).

To address this, we compile data from research documenting plastic debris ingestion by marine fish, totaling 171,774 individuals of 555 species. Overall, 386 marine fish species have ingested plastic debris including 210 species of commercial importance. However, 148 species studied had no records of plastic consumption, suggesting that while this evolutionary trap is widespread, it is not yet universal. Across all studies that accounted for microplastics, the incidence rate of plastic ingested by fish was 26%. Over the last decade this incidence has doubled, increasing by 2.4\xa0±\xa00.4%\xa0per year. This is driven both by increasing detection of smaller sized particles as a result of improved methodologies, as well as an increase in fish consuming plastic. Further, we investigated the role of geographic, ecological, and behavioral factors in the ingestion of plastic across species. These analyses revealed that the abundance of plastic in surface waters was positively correlated to plastic ingestion. Demersal species are more likely to ingest plastic in shallow waters; in contrast, pelagic species were most likely to consume plastic below the mixed layer. Mobile predatory species had the highest likelihood to ingest plastic; similarly, we found a positive relationship between trophic level and plastic ingestion. We also find evidence that surface ingestion-deep sea egestion of microplastics by mesopelagic myctophids is likely a key mechanism for the export of microplastics from the surface ocean to the seafloor, a sink for marine debris.

In the last 10\xa0years, despite marine turtles representing just 2% of all turtle species, almost 50% of relevant turtle dietary studies involved only marine turtles. These results suggest that the potential threat of plastic ingestion is poorly studied in non-marine turtles. We also examine plastic ingestion frequency in a freshwater turtle population, finding that 7.7% of 65 turtles had ingested plastic. However, plastic-resembling organic material would have inflated our frequency results up to 40% higher were it not for verification using Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, we showcase how non-native turtles can be used as a proxy for understanding the potential for plastic ingestion by co-occurring native turtles of conservation concern.

Of the 51 seabird species examined for plastic ingestion in the Arctic, over half have ingested plastic; however, the majority have a limited number of studies, small sample sizes, and (or) data are more than 15 years old. Additionally, the spatial distribution of plastic ingestion reports in the Arctic varies widely, with large knowledge gaps in the northernmost areas of most countries. This indicates that we lack recent information on plastic ingestion for most of the seabird species in the Arctic. Further, less than one-third of studies reference standardized methods from other regions, making it difficult to assess spatial and temporal trends.

Specifically, we investigated whether ingestion prevalence has changed over time, what types of debris are most commonly ingested, the geographic distribution of debris ingestion by marine turtles relative to global debris distribution, and which species and life-history stages are most likely to ingest debris. The probability of green (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) ingesting debris increased significantly over time, and plastic was the most commonly ingested debris. Turtles in nearly all regions studied ingest debris, but the probability of ingestion was not related to modeled debris densities. Furthermore, smaller, oceanic-stage turtles were more likely to ingest debris than coastal foragers, whereas carnivorous species were less likely to ingest debris than herbivores or gelatinovores.

The adsorption kinetics showed slow and mild rising zones from the natural behavior of the chemical adsorption. The results indicated that both MP characteristics and water properties played a significant role in the adsorption behavior of inorganic As species. The As adsorption equilibrium was modeled well by both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and partly fitted with the Sips model suggesting that both mono-layer and multi-layer adsorption occurred during adsorption The spontaneous adsorption process for both As(III) and As(V) was evidenced by the adsorption thermodynamics. The maximum adsorption capacities of As(III) and As(V) reached 143.3\xa0mg/kg and 109.8\xa0mg/kg on PS in deionized water, which were higher than those on sediment-PS mixture (119.3\xa0mg/kg, 99.2\xa0mg/kg), which were all lower than on sediment alone (263.3\xa0mg/kg, 398.7\xa0mg/kg). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis identified that As(III) and As(V) interaction with sediment surface functional groups was the main adsorption mechanism from surface complexation and coordination. Two functional groups of polystyrene (-NH2, -OH) were mainly involved in the adsorption of inorganic As species on PS, while -COO- and -OH functional groups contributed to the adsorption mechanism of inorganic As species on LDPE. The findings provide valuable insight on the adsorption behavior and mechanisms of As(III) and As(V) in river systems in the presence of MPs particles.

In this work, Copper (Cu(II)) was chosen as the classic pollutant, polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pellets were used as the typical marine microplastics, the adsorption performance of Cu(II) on PS and PET beads was investigated by adsorption kinetics and isotherm experiments, and other influencing conditions, such as pH, salinity, coexisting heavy metals ions and aging treatment, were evaluated. The results indicated that the adsorption behavior of Cu(II) on PS and PET was spontaneous and endothermic in the simulated seawater environment, and the batch experimental data can be effectively described by pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich isothermal model. Besides, the adsorption capacity of microplastics for Cu(II) was the best at pH 7, the change of salinity had no obvious effect on the adsorption in the natural marine environment. Moreover, co-existence of lead (Pb(II)) exhibited evident impacts on Cu(II) sorption onto PS and PET, which confirmed the adsorption competition effect between them. Additionally, high temperature aging treatment of microplastics in different environments for different duration time could obviously affect the properties of microplastics. It was found that the microplastics after being exposed to high temperature environment in the air for 168 h showed relatively stronger adsorption amount for Cu(II). In summary, these findings suggested that electrostatic interaction and distributed diffusion mechanisms may be the main mechanisms of adsorption, while no new functional groups were generated after the adsorption, indicating that physisorption may dominate the adsorption performance of PS and PET pellets for Cu(II).

In this work, an investigation of the adsorption of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn by five different types of microplastics was performed in Milli-Q water and natural waters (seawater, urban wastewater and irrigation water) via a series of batch adsorption experiments. The effects of concentration of metals and physicochemical characteristics of polymers were particularly studied. Results revealed a significant adsorption of lead, chromium and zinc on microplastics, especially on polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride. In the case of polyethylene terephthalate, it showed little adsorption capacity. Specific surface, porosity and morphology are characteristics that affect the molecular interactions. The adsorption isotherms were better described by Langmuir model, which indicates that the main adsorption mechanism might be chemical adsorption. Finally, results obtained in natural waters indicated that dissolved organic matter may play a major role on metal adsorption on microplastics.

The environmental impacts of plastic waste on marine and terrestrial ecosystems have been recognized for years. Recently, researchers found that micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), micron (100 nm – 5 mm) and nanometer (1 – 100 nm) scale particles and fibers produced by degradation and fragmentation of plastic waste in the environment, have become an important emerging environmental and food chain contaminant with uncertain consequences for human health. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent findings from studies of potential toxicity and adverse health impacts of MNPs in terrestrial mammals, including studies in both in vitro cellular and in vivo mammalian models. Also reviewed here are recently released biomonitoring studies that have characterized the bioaccumulation, biodistribution, and excretion of MNPs in humans. The majority MNPs in the environment to which humans are most likely to be exposed, are of irregular shapes, varied sizes, and mixed compositions, and are defined as secondary MNPs. However, the MNPs used in most toxicity studies to date were commercially available primary MNPs of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and other polymers. The emerging in vitro and in vivo evidence reviewed here suggests that MNP toxicity and bioactivity are largely determined by MNP particle physico-chemical characteristics, including size, shape, polymer type, and surface properties. For human exposure, MNPs have been identified in human blood, urine, feces, and placenta, which pose potential health risks. The evidence to date suggests that the mechanisms underlying MNP toxicity at the cellular level are primarily driven by oxidative stress. Nonetheless, large knowledge gaps in our understanding of MNP toxicity and the potential health impacts of MNP exposures still exist and much further study is needed to bridge those gaps. This includes human population exposure studies to determine the environmentally relevant MNP polymers and exposure concentrations and durations for toxicity studies, as well as toxicity studies employing environmentally relevant MNPs, with surface chemistries and other physico-chemical properties consistent with MNP particles in the environment. It is especially important to obtain comprehensive toxicological data for these MNPs to understand the range and extent of potential adverse impacts of microplastic pollutants on humans and other organisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.', 'Chemically, microplastics (MPs) are synthetic materials composed of plastic monomers and additives and vary in size from 0.1-5,000 μm. Due to their chemical stability and the widespread use of plastics for various purposes, MPs pollution of the environment has increased dramatically, leading to the contamination of daily consumer products as well. Although previous studies have reported the environmental impacts of MPs, only a few studies have highlighted the occurrence of MPs in food products and their possible effects on human health. Recent investigations have identified MP particles in drinking water and other beverages, seafood, plant products, salt, sugar, and honey, raising an alarm over the safety and quality of these food items. Ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact of such food and other consumer goods are the common routes through which MPs may enter the human body and can have several deleterious health impacts including oxidative stress, inflammation, immunotoxicity, increased risk of neoplasia, cellular metabolism impairment, neurotoxicity, gut microbiome dysbiosis, disruption of reproductive system among others. A collective approach employing source control, recycling, biodegradable plastics, strengthening legislation, and bioremediation could be a promising and sustainable solution to control the MPs pollution. The key challenge appears to standarize detection methods along with reducing the MPs contamination from the food products as well as from the environment. Therefore, this review focuses on the occurrence of MPs in several food products, current methods of analysis, potential health impacts, and strategies to mitigate the widespread MPs pollution. It also adds novel findings, knowledge gaps, and recommendations that can guide future research in this field. © 2024 The Author(s)', 'Plastics are widely applied in industry, agriculture, medicine and daily life products due to their excellent physicochemical properties. However, the vast production and disposal of plastics have resulted in large amounts of plastics debris entering into terrestrial, atmospheric, freshwater, and marine environments. These plastic debris can be gradually fragmented into microplastics (1 μm–5 mm) or nanoplastics (1 nm–1 μm) through physical abrasion, photodegradation, chemical degradation, and biodegradation. The environmental pollution of micro/nanoplastics has become a major environmental issue of global concern because of the widespread detection of micro/nanoplastics in various environmental media and organisms. The small-sized micro/nanoplastics are often hard to be degraded and easy to migrate. When present in food, water, air, and daily necessities, micro/nanoplastics can enter the human body through the digestive tract, respiratory tract, and skin contact. This is supported by the fact that micro/nanoplastics have been detected in human feces, blood and placenta. The accumulation of micro/nanoplastics may induce toxic effects on tissues and organs, and further endanger human health. Although many literatures have reported the adverse effects of micro/nanoplastics on living organisms, the internal processes and modes of toxic action, particularly the penetration of micro/nanoplastics into important biological barriers, the accumulation, transfer and distribution of micro/nanoplastics inside the receptors, have not been systematically reviewed and analyzed. This study focuses on the research topic of toxic effects and health risks of micro/nanoplastics. The related studies of micro/nanoplastics in human body, model animals and typical human cells are systematically teased out. The main exposure routes of micro/nanoplastics and their potential penetration into gastrointestinal barrier, lung barrier and skin barrier are critically reviewed. The capacity of micro/nanoplastics penetrating into the biological barriers is mainly determined by their physicochemical properties, especially particle size and surface charge. The behavioral process and controlling factors of the transfer and accumulation of micro/nano plastics in various organs including liver, brain, testis, fetal through blood circulation are analyzed. Micro/nanoplastics can be adsorbed on the surface of erythrocyte or be internalized by erythrocyte by means of van der Waals forces, electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effect, thereby reducing the possibility of micro/nanoplastics being removed by the liver and spleen during blood circulation, extending their residence time in the blood and increasing the risk of their transfer to other secondary organs. The toxic effects of micro/nanoplastics on different tissues and organs and the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level are further identified. Oxidative damage and metabolic disturbance are found to be the common mechanisms responsible for the toxicity of different types of micro/nanoplastics. Given that micro/nanoplastics can persist in the environment for a long time, the damage can possibly transfer from parents to offspring. Through revisiting the relevant studies, we highlight that the transgenerational and multigenerational toxicity cannot be ignored. The possible release of various additives from micro/nanoplastics is suspected to be an important source of risk. Therefore, the joint interactions and effects of micro/nanoplastics and plastic additives are also evaluated. The bottlenecks and technical challenges in the research area of the health risk assessment of micro/nanoplastics are discussed. We propose that future research efforts should be devoted to the development of precise approaches for qualifying and quantifying micro/nanoplastics, the exploration of carrier effects of micro/nanoplastics, and the initiation of epidemiological investigation of micro/ nanoplastics pollution. This is expected to lay a foundation for further guiding research on the human health effects of micro/nanoplastics. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.']"

Soiled consumer wash loads from U.K. households were found to release a mean of 114 ± 66.8 ppm (mg microfiber per kg fabric) (n = 79) fibers during typical washing conditions and these were mainly composed of natural fibers. Microfiber release decreased with increasing wash load size and hence decreasing water to fabric ratio, with mean microfiber release from wash loads in the mass range 1.0–3.5 kg (n = 57) found to be 132.4 ± 68.6 ppm, significantly (p = 3.3 x 10−8) higher than the 66.3 ± 27.0 ppm of those in the 3.5–6.0 kg range (n = 22). In further tests with similar soiled consumer wash loads, moving to colder and quicker washing cycles (i.e. 15°C for 30 mins, as opposed to 40°C for 85 mins) significantly reduced microfiber generation by 30% (p = 0.036) and reduced whiteness loss by 42% (p = 0.000) through reduced dye transfer and soil re-deposition, compared to conventional 40°C cycles. In multicycle technical testing, detergent pods were selected for investigation and found to have no impact on microfiber release compared to washing in water alone. Fabric softeners were also found to have no direct impact on microfiber release in testing under both European and North American washing conditions. Extended testing of polyester fleece garments up to a 48-wash cycle history under European conditions found that microfiber release significantly reduced to a consistent low level of 28.7 ± 10.9 ppm from eight through 64 washes. Emerging North American High-Efficiency top-loading washing machines generated significantly lower microfiber release than traditional top-loading machines, likely due to their lower water fill volumes and hence lower water to fabric ratio, with a 69.7% reduction observed for polyester fleece (n = 32, p = 7.9 x 10−6) and 37.4% reduction for polyester T-shirt (n = 32, p = 0.0032). These results conclude that consumers can directly reduce the levels of microfibers generated per wash during domestic textile washing by using colder and quicker wash cycles, washing complete (but not overfilled) loads, and (in North America) converting to High-Efficiency washing machines. Moving to colder and quicker cycles will also indirectly reduce microfiber release by extending the lifetime of clothing, leading to fewer new garments being purchased and hence lower incidence of the high microfiber release occurring during the first few washes of a new item. © 2020 Lant et al.

Currently there are various methods to produce ultra-fine fibers such as electrospinning centrifugal spinning flash spinning and melt spinning. Among them melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers have broadly drawn attention due to the selective diversity of combinations of raw materials and processing techniques. In addition melt-spun bicomponent fibers are dominant in the market because of their ability to be produced on a large scale. However industrial producing of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers usually suffers from problems such as high energy consumption large diameter and environmental issue which limit their high-quality development and applications in future. During the practical processing selection of different polymers use age of spinning packs of different sizes and adjustment of different spinning parameters have significant impacts on the formation of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers. Therefore it is of great significance to regulate the influencing factors in the forming process of bicomponent ultra-fine fibers to further improve their comprehensive performances. In order to understand the nature of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers more comprehensively this paper took segmented-pie fibers and sea-island fibers as the research matrix explored the spinning and forming mechanism of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers and the influencing factors elaborated the diverse open fiber processes of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers and summarized the applications of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers in different fields. As for the spinning process by using conjugated melt spinning with different types of melt distribution systems segmented-pie fibers and figured sea-island fibers could be prepared respectively. In the meanwhile the forming mechanism of unfigured sea-island fibers was clearly revealed. In the spinning process blended polymer droplets were stretched into long or elliptical shapes in the spinning pack which is the main reason for the uneven diameters of unfigured sea-island fibers compared to figured sea-island fibers. There are notable differences in the properties of figured and unfigured sea-island fibers. Moreover the finer fiber diameters can be obtained by increasing the drawing multiplier and improving the properties of the polymer feedstock. As for fiber splitting process there are three types of fiber splitting methods namely mechanical chemical and thermal means. It was found that energy consumption of fiber splitting can be effectively reduced by decreasing the interfacial bonding between polymers. Significantly the use of water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol PVA points a way for developing green bicomponent ultra-fine fibers. Due to the low dimension high specific surface area and facile functional finishing melt-spun bicomponent fibers have a wide range of applications such as ultra-fine fiber artificial leather air filer medical and health materials. Melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers show excellent comprehensive performance and have wide application prospects. However there are still several tasks for preparing melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers such as reducing energy consumption and pollution during melt spinning and fiber splitting and preparing melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers with finer diameters and excellent properties. In the selection of raw materials polymer raw materials with different excellent properties should be further developed so as to broaden the diversified combinations of raw materials for melt-spun bicomponent fibers in the process of preparation the research and development of precision components and the optimization of molding process should be carried out so as to improve the performance of melt-spun bicomponent fibers and realize the further refinement the fiber diameters about the fiber splitting along with the concept of green environmental protection low energy consumption chemical-free reagents and efficient green fiber splitting process should be developed. Water-soluble fiber opening as a green fiber opening method provides a good development direction for bicomponent ultra-fine fibers. Water-soluble polymers provide a good direction for the development of melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers. And with the continuous development of the nonwoven industry it is believed melt-spun bicomponent ultra-fine fibers will develop toward the direction of green multi-function and high performance in the future so as to better benefit mankind and society. © 2024 China Silk Association.

Investigations confirmed the universal presence of these fragments throughout the atmosphere including air water and soil. Tiny plastic fibers are the major source of this type of pollutant. Microfiber released by domestic laundering processes of synthetic fabric has recently been detected as the prime source of microfiber pollution in the aquatic environment. However, it is vital to understand the contribution of the synthetic clothes laundering to this environmental problem. Current study mainly focuses on the quantification of data about the release of microplastics, and to identify possible influences of textile characteristics on the release. Washing trials were performed using daily use synthetic garments in the household washing machine in order to record the influence of the washing parameters on the quantity of micro fleeces released. These tiny particles are discharged into the marine environment each year from a variety of sources, of which approximately 700,000 micro fragments are released and 1900 particles from one piece of garment. It can be predicted that, till date, 1.5 million trillion of MF pollutants are currently gathered in the ocean discharged by principal microfiber contributing countries. Domestic washing machines, unable to filter tiny fibers; hence, they can be easily escaped through the outlet to the river and oceans via domestic drainage. Synthetic microfibers are harmful as they are polluting the whole food chain when these pollutants are ingested by smaller aquatic organisms inadvertently. Advancement in the microscopic and spectroscopic techniques is employed for the quick detection of microfleece pollutant in various aquatic systems. Although few and technology with advanced density separation and centrifugation were developed to combat this pollution. However it was scientifically investigated that none of this method and product can filter MFs so competently. Meticulous research in this field is necessary and pre requisite for developing a technique for recycling of these pollutants and sustainable management, which may diminish the pollution level of the water bodies. Future research should primarily aim at developing novel techniques as a solution to this problem. In this present work, primarily the washing machine effluents samples were collected from 5 different house hold regions of Bhubaneswar city, from Odisha state of India. Physiochemical parameters such as pH, Total dissolved solid, Total suspended solid of the collected grey water samples were measured to observe the variation. Morphological feature of the collected microfiber particles such as texture, colour, number and weight were measured. Around 500–520 numbers of visible fiber fleeces were present in 1\xa0L of effluent sample, having biomass 3\xa0mg/L approximately. Dominant presence of deep-red, black and blue coloured microfibers having fiber length 1–2.5\xa0cm was observed. Abundant presence of polyester fiber groups is confirmed through hit description image and peaks 1240.03–2917.38 obtained from FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.']"

In spite of intensive research, many questions remain open, such as the processes that drive the deposition and remobilization of plastic debris on river beaches. The objectives of this study were: i) to analyze the influence of the natural hydrological fluctuations and wind intensity on the distribution of mesoplastic (0.5–2.5 cm) and macroplastic (>2.5 cm) debris in beach sediments of a large river, ii) to describe the type of plastic debris found and iii) to explore potential relations between the number of items and weight of macro- and mesoplastics. Our results suggest that, during lowering water levels, flow removes the plastic debris and transports it further downstream. Conversely, when the beach sediments remain exposed during long periods, the plastic debris accumulates considerably. Nevertheless, the influence of wind intensity on plastic debris transport was comparatively negligible. In other words, in our study the water flow had a greater capacity to remobilize and transport plastic debris than the wind. The most abundant mesoplastic items were foam, hard plastic, film and small fragments of fishing line. The dominant macroplastic items recorded were pieces of fishing line (nylon) and cigarette filters (cellulose acetate), typically discarded by beach users. Other items found in large quantities were soft packaging elements (expanded polystyrene), hard plastic containers (polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate) and beverage bottles (polyethylene terephthalate), typical items of domestic use in the Paraná River region. Finally, we found that the density of macroplastic items is highly correlated to the density of mesoplastic items, serving as surrogate for further estimations.

By using field investigation, sand samples were collected from two sections on FLB adjacent to land-based sources in December 2019, and the plastic debris in the sand samples was quantified and characterized in the laboratory. The amount of plastic debris ranged from 2 to 82 particles/m2 on this marine sand beach. There was a significant difference in plastic debris amount between the transects along the land-based source input zone (p < 0.05) due to the impacts of wind, ocean currents, and waves. The most abundant size of plastics was 0.5–2.5 cm (44.4%). Moreover, the most common color was white (60.9%). The most abundant shape of plastic debris fell into the fragment category (76.2%). The plastic debris amounts were significantly correlated with multiple sizes. Our results show that land-based wastewater discharge is a large plastic debris source on FLB under coastal water tide variation.

The results showed mean abundance of plastic debris in summer (6.00 ± 2.10 items/m2) was significantly greater than that in winter (3.75 ± 2.12 items/m2). In addition, the composition of plastic debris ranged in size mainly from 1 to 5 mm and 0.5 to 2.5 cm in winter and summer, respectively. In terms of composition, white plastic debris was the most common (81.1%), and foam was the most abundant (64.4%). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the abundance of plastic debris and sand grain size fraction (p < 0.05), implying the abundances of microplastic debris were more easily impacted by sand grain size (>2 mm). In total inventory, there were about 1.18 × 105 and 2.95 × 105 items of plastic debris on the YPB in winter and summer, respectively. The tidal variation and human activities are responsible for the plastic debris accumulation.

However, there is no consensus on their potential to cause significant ecological harm, and a comprehensive risk assessment of mP pollution is unattainable due to gaps in our understanding of their transport, uptake, and exchange processes. This research considers drag models that have been proposed to calculate the terminal settling velocity of regularly and irregularly shaped particles to assess their applicability in a mP modeling context. The evaluation indicates three models that predict the settling velocity of mPs to a high precision and suggests that an explicit model is the most appropriate for implementation in a mP transport model. This research demonstrates that the mP settling velocity does not vary significantly over time and depth relevant to the scale of an ocean model and that the terminal settling velocity is independent of the initial particle velocity.

MPs can be transported far into various aquatic environments, leading to widespread pollution, studying the settling and rising dynamics of MPs provides vital insights into the transport behaviors of MP particles in aquatic environments. To date, numerical investigation that sufficiently accounts for MPs' complex shapes does not exist. To accurately predict the fate, trajectory, accumulation, and transport of MPs in natural aquatic environments, identifying their settling velocity and drag is paramount. In this study, a finite volume-based three-dimensional numerical model is implemented to calculate the settling and rising dynamics of MP particles with various pre-defined shapes. Results validate the robustness of the present model in simulating the trajectories and velocities during the settling of MP-sized particles. For particles with regular shapes, the settling patterns obtained from the present numerical model match well with the previous theoretical models derived from the settling of natural sediments. Terminal settling velocities obtained from the present study are also compatible with previous experimental data for spherical particles. Irregularly shaped MP objects are also tested with the model. The settling patterns of MP-sized thin cylinder, which resembles MP sheets, show good agreement with previous experimental observations.

The density range, size classes, and typical particle shapes are presented, and their variation with time due to weathering, biofouling, and mechanical degradation in the swash zone is considered. The dependence of the time rate of increase of integral particle density on the particle shape due to its biofouling shows that floating fibers and threads (“one-dimensional” (1-D) particles) are the first to begin sinking, followed by 2-D films and flakes, and then 3-D fragments. Mechanical fragmentation in the swash zone of plastic samples made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and foamed polystyrene (foamed PS) shows qualitative features of the generated MP particles and indicates that increase in mass of MPs with time is exponential. Dynamic behavior of MPs is discussed on the base of knowledge from classical hydrodynamics, marine sedimentology, and physical oceanography. Shape-dependent manner of the particle sinking and the value of the terminal settling velocity are characterized in terms of the particle size, density, and angularity. Critical velocity of resuspension by a unidirectional flow is addressed in terms of the Shields diagram, summarizing available published data on laboratory experiments on the particles with properties similar to those of MPs. Consideration of motion of particles in an oscillatory flow under surface waves and in roll structures illuminates mechanisms of mixing of MPs and natural marine debris. Analysis of the observed sorting of sediment grains under the influence of surface waves raises the question of probable sorting of MPs in the water column of the coastal zone, leading to different transport for different kinds of MP particles, including the offshore export of smaller MPs, onshore transport of larger particles, and possible effect of arresting of finer MPs under coarser sediment grains. Typical velocity scales of natural convective flows and upward/downward motions within the Langmuir circulation cells are shown to be of the same order of magnitude as the settling velocity of common MPs-units of centimeters per second-which suggests the importance of these mixing mechanisms for the motion of MP particles. As a natural case study, the events of washouts of heavily intermixed patches of seaweed, amber stones, and MPs onto the beaches of the Baltic Sea after severe storms are examined. It is concluded that stormy episodes seem to bring repeatedly larger plastics to the surf and swash zone and export smaller pieces offshore. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.']"

The influent exhibited an average MPs concentration of 70.1 ± 28.6 MPs/L. After undergoing the fine screen and grit chamber units, the MPs concentration significantly reduced to 19.7 ± 3.6 MPs/L, indicating an impressive removal rate of 71.8%. Upon completion of the secondary treatment, the effluent contained 7.1 ± 1.7 MPs/L, resulting in an overall MP removal of 89.9–91.0%. The findings indicated that fibers constituted the predominant particle shape, followed by fragments. Fibers were effectively removed through primary treatment (71.8%), while fragments were efficiently removed during secondary treatment (81.1%). The analysis of sludge samples from the aeration basin and sludge thickening tank revealed higher concentrations, with 14.3 and 25 folds increase compared to the influent, respectively indicating the accumulation of MPs in sludge.

Despite the high removal efficiency in the investigated WWTP, it has been shown that it acts as an important source of MPs to the sea ecosystem due to the high discharge rates. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd', 'Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous emerging pollutants that have been found in the marine, freshwater, air, and soil environments.

In this review, the occurrence characteristics and removal rates of MPs in 78 WWTPs from 57 studies were discussed based on Metaanalysis. Specifically, the key aspects regarding MPs removal in WWTPs, such as wastewater treatment processes and MPs shapes, sizes, and polymer compositions were analyzed and compared. The results showed that; CD the abundances of MPs in the influent and effluent were 1.56×10-2-3.14 ×10-4n·L-1and 1.70×10-3-3.09×102n·L-1, respectively. The abundance of MPs in the sludge ranged from 1. 80 × 10-1to 9.38 × 103n·g-1.

(3) The removal rate of MPs in primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment process were 62.87%, 55.78%, and 58.45%, respectively. The combination process of ""grid + sedimentation tank + primary sedimentation tank"" had the highest removal rate towards MPs in primary treatment processes, and the membrane bioreactor had the highest one beyond other secondary treatment processes. Filtration was the best process in tertiary treatment. (4) The film, foam, and fragment MPs were easier to remove (>90% ) than fiber and spherical (<90%) MPs by WWTPs.

Although it is assumed that most marine plastics are transported from land to the ocean through rivers, only limited data on riverine plastic transport exists. Recently, new methods have been introduced to characterize riverine plastics consistently through time and space. For example, combining visual counting observations and plastic debris sampling can provide order of magnitude estimations of plastic transport through a river. In this paper, we present findings from multi-season measurement campaign in the Saigon River, Vietnam. For the first time, we demonstrate that macroplastic transport exhibits strong temporal variation. The monthly averaged plastic transport changes up to a factor five within the measurement period. As it is unclear what drives the variation in plastic transport, relations between rainfall, river discharge, presence of organic material and plastic transport have been explored. Furthermore, we present new findings on the cross-sectional and vertical distribution of riverine plastic transport. With this paper we present new insights in the origin and fate of riverine plastic transport, emphasizing the severity of the emerging thread of plastic pollution on riverine ecosystems. © 2019, The Author(s).', ""Plastic is an emerging pollutant, and the quantities in rivers and oceans are expected to increase. Rivers are assumed to transport land-based plastic into the ocean, and the fluvial and marine transport processes have been relatively well studied to date. However, the processes controlling the transport in tidal rivers and estuaries, the interface between fluvial and marine systems, remain largely unresolved. For this reason, current estimates of riverine plastic pollution and export into the ocean remain highly uncertain. Hydrodynamics in tidal rivers and estuaries are influenced by tides and freshwater discharge. As a consequence, flow velocity direction and magnitude can change diurnally. In turn, this impacts the transport dynamics of solutes and pollutants, including plastics. Plastic transport dynamics in tidal rivers and estuaries remain understudied, yet the available observations suggest that plastics can be retained here for long time periods, especially during periods of low net discharge. Additional factors such as riparian vegetation and riverbank characteristics, in combination with bi-directional flows and varying water levels, can lead to an even higher likelihood of long-term retention. Here, we provide a first observation-based estimate of net plastic transport on a daily timescale in tidal rivers. For this purpose, we developed a simple Eulerian approach using sub-hourly observations of plastic transport and discharge during full tidal cycles. We applied our method to the highly polluted Saigon River, Vietnam, throughout six full tidal cycles in May 2022. We show that the net plastic transport is about 20%-33% of the total plastic transport. We found that plastic transport and river discharge are positively and significantly correlated (Pearson's R2Combining double low line0.76). The net transport of plastic is higher than the net discharge (20%-33% and 16%, respectively), suggesting that plastic transport is governed by factors other than water flow. Such factors include wind, varying plastic concentrations in the water, and entrapment of plastics downstream of the measurement site. The plastic net transport rates alternate between positive (seaward) net transport and negative (landward) net transport as a result of the diurnal inequality in the tidal cycles. We found that soft and neutrally buoyant items had considerably lower net transport rates than rigid and highly buoyant items (10%-16% vs. 30%-38%), suggesting that transport dynamics strongly depend on item characteristics. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of tidal dynamics and bi-directional flows in plastic transport dynamics. With this paper we emphasize the importance of understanding fundamental transport dynamics in tidal rivers and estuaries to ultimately reduce the uncertainties of plastic emission estimates into the ocean.  © Copyright: "", 'Rivers are pathways and storage zones for plastic pollution. Land-based plastic waste enters river systems through anthropogenic and hydrometeorological processes, after which they are transported and retained. Only a small fraction ((Formula presented.) 2%) is assumed to make it into the ocean. Understanding and quantifying river plastic transport are important to optimize prevention and reduction strategies and to evaluate the efficacy of new regulations and interventions. To achieve this, consistent and reliable data are crucial. River plastic pollution monitoring is still an emerging field, especially since river-scale plastic pollution assessments are limited to date. Here, we present an estimate of floating plastic transport and polymer characterization along the Rhine, from Switzerland to the river mouth in Netherlands. We show plastic transport is highly variable along the river, but with a significant increase towards the river mouth. High plastic transport was observed close to urban areas, and confluences with tributaries, suggesting both are likely entry points of plastic pollution. The largest plastic transport was measured in the estuary, which is explained by the tidal dynamics, limiting the transport of plastic into the sea. Our results can be used as a baseline to compare with future assessments. Furthermore, the plastic transport and composition estimates can be directly compared to other rivers that applied the same approach, which may reduce the uncertainty in global river plastic emission simulations. With our study, we aim to contribute to the development of a simple harmonized plastic monitoring approach to quantify plastic pollution at the river basin scale.

The quantity of derelict gear entering the oceans remains unknown because of heterogeneity in fishing gear and effort, as well as inadequate monitoring. Prior studies have been limited in scope to specific fisheries and regions, and large-scale estimates lack an empirical basis. It is critically important for decision makers to have credible information in order to design effective remediation efforts. We estimated the amount of industrial fishing effort and the associated plastic debris entering the ocean globally each year from lost fishing gear. Using remote observations of fishing vessel activity paired with technical fishing gear models, we generated a bounding estimate for gear operation and loss worldwide in 2018. We estimate that industrial trawl, purse-seine and pelagic longline fisheries operated 2.1 Mt of plastic gear over 2018 to obtain 49.7 Mt of retained and discarded catch, representing 74% of industrial marine capture globally. The median estimate for plastic gear lost during the use of these gear types was 48.4 kt (95% confidence interval: 28.4–99.5 kt). This estimate excludes abandoned and discarded gear. Improved observation, especially of small-scale fisheries, is needed to better understand the sources of derelict gear.

To effectively prevent and reduce ALDFG at source, an understanding of the major causes of and drivers behind fishing gear losses is required. We interviewed 451 fishers from seven countries around the world (Belize, Iceland, Indonesia, Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, and the United States of America) representing five key fishing gear types (gillnets, purse seine nets, trawl nets, longlines, and pots and traps) about why and under what circumstances they lose their gear. We also asked them their views on the most effective interventions to reduce gear losses. Across all major gear types and countries where interviews were undertaken, bad weather was the most common cause of gear loss, followed by interactions with wildlife (identified as a cause for loss by 81% and 65% of all fishers interviewed, respectively). Snagging gear on a bottom obstruction was a major cause of loss for gears that contact the seafloor, along with conflicts with other fishers, often via gear and vessel interactions, for gillnet and pot and trap fishers. Operational and behavioral characteristics such as gear type, trip length, and the party responsible to pay for gear repairs and replacements all significantly influenced gear losses. Gear maintenance was the most effective gear loss prevention measure across all gear types and countries reported by fishers, followed by training crew in gear management (identified as an effective prevention measure by 95% and 82% of all fishers interviewed, respectively). Actions available to fishers, managers and port operators to effectively prevent fishing gear losses include: gear maintenance; reducing active gear interactions with wildlife; reducing financial and administrative burdens for port reception facilities; reducing trip lengths; and targeting education and gear stewardship programs to fishers with limited ALDFG awareness, particularly those in low income fisheries and countries. © Copyright © 2021 Richardson, Hardesty, Vince and Wilcox.', 'Marine pollution by lost, abandoned or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) often has negative impact on the ecosystem through plastic pollution and continuous capture of marine animals, so-called “ghost fishing”. ALDFG in pot fisheries is associated with high ghost fishing risk. The snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) pot fishery is conducted in harsh weather conditions increasing the risk of fishing gear loss. Due to plastic materials used in the pot construction, lost gear can most likely continue fishing for decades. This study presents a method to quantify ghost fishing efficiency relative to catch efficiency of actively fished pots. On average, the ghost fishing pots captured 8.29 % (confidence intervals: 4.33–13.73 %) target-sized snow crab compared to the actively fished pots, demonstrating that lost pots can continue fishing even when the bait is decayed. Given the large number of pots lost each year, the ghost fishing efficiency is a considerable challenge in this fishery. © 2023 The Authors']"

Identifying hotspots where marine debris accumulates will enable effective control; however, knowledge on the location of accumulation hotspots remains incomplete. In particular, marine debris accumulation on beaches is a concern. Surveys of beaches require intensive human effort, and survey methods are not standardized. If marine debris monitoring is conducted using a standardized method, data from different regions can be compared. With an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and deep learning computational methods, monitoring a wide area at a low cost in a standardized way may be possible. In this study, we aimed to identify marine debris on beaches through deep learning using high-resolutionUAVimages by conducting a survey on Narugashima Island in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. The flight altitude relative to the ground was set to 5m, and images of a 0.81-ha area were obtained. Flight was conducted twice: Before and after the beach cleaning. The combination of UAVs equipped with a zoom lens and operation at a low altitude allows for the acquisition of high resolution images of 1.1mm/pixel.

In this paper, we present developments of new and emerging remote-sensing technologies of marine plastic litter such as passive techniques: fluid lensing, multi-angle polarimetry, and thermal infrared sensing (TIS); and active techniques: light detection and ranging (LiDAR), multispectral imaging detection and active reflectance (MiDAR), and radio detection and ranging (RADAR). Our review of the detection capabilities and limitations of the different sensing technologies shows that each has their own weaknesses and strengths, and that there is not one single sensing technique that applies to all kinds of marine litter under every different condition in the aquatic environment. Rather, we should focus on the synergy between different technologies to detect marine plastic litter and potentially the use of proxies to estimate its presence. Therefore, in addition to further developing remote-sensing techniques, more research is needed in the composition of marine litter and the relationships between marine plastic litter and their proxies. In this paper, we propose a common vocabulary to help the community to translate concepts among different disciplines and techniques. © 2024 by the authors.', 'The persistent plastic litter, originating from different sources and transported from rivers to oceans, has posed serious biological, ecological, and chemical effects on the marine ecosystem, and is considered a global issue. In the past decade, many studies have identified, monitored, and tracked marine plastic debris in coastal and open ocean areas using remote sensing technologies. Compared to traditional surveying methods, high-resolution (spatial and temporal) multispectral or hyperspectral remote sensing data have been substantially used to monitor floating marine macro litter (FMML). In this systematic review, we present an overview of remote sensing data and techniques for detecting FMML, as well as their challenges and opportunities. We reviewed the studies based on different sensors and platforms, spatial and spectral resolution, ground sampling data, plastic detection methods, and accuracy obtained in detecting marine litter. In addition, this study elaborates the usefulness of high-resolution remote sensing data in Visible (VIS), Near-infrared (NIR), and Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) range, along with spectral signatures of plastic, in-situ samples, and spectral indices for automatic detection of FMML. Moreover, the Thermal Infrared (TIR), Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were introduced and these were demonstrated that could be used as a supplement dataset for the identification and quantification of FMML. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd', 'Despite the importance of remote detection of marine debris, nearly all published studies are focused on either controlled experiments, or Sentinel-2 data with mixed band resolutions that are subject to large uncertainties. To date, key questions such as the following have not been addressed adequately: To what extent can the various forms of marine debris be remotely detected and differentiated through satellite observations in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral range, and how? Here, using published reflectance spectra of various types of floating matters, I address these questions through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and spectral analyses of satellite images. While the study is by no means comprehensive, several observations can still be made. First, it appears impossible to remotely detect marine microplastics from all existing and planned optical sensors. This is simply because the contribution of these particles to the sensor signal, even when they are aggregated on the water surface at the reported maximum particle density, is at least 60 times lower than the required signal (~0.2% subpixel coverage) and 20 times lower than the sensor noise for a sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 200. In contrast, detecting macroplastics and other debris is possible when they form large patches along ocean fronts or windrows. Second, assuming a SNR of 200, discriminating large patches of marine debris from floating algae is only possible with a subpixel coverage of >0.3%. These threshold values are based on the sensor SNRs only, and they represent the lower bounds of detection and discrimination, respectively. The real threshold values above which a detection or discrimination is possible also depend on the observing conditions, and therefore higher. Third, currently, Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) sensors provide an optimal trade between resolution and coverage, yet MSI sensors have SNRs <200, and interpretation of the MSI spectra requires extra caution due to variable spatial resolutions in different bands, among other factors. From the perspective of pure spectroscopy, it is possible to discriminate floating algae from non-algae floating matters but difficult to differentiate the type of the latter (either plastic or non-plastic debris, foam, etc) because different non-algae floating matters all show relatively flat reflectance spectral shapes in the vis-NIR spectral range. Finally, based on these results, recommendations are made on algorithm designs and sensor designs, for example spectral analysis should be performed over the difference spectra to minimize the impact of variable subpixel coverage, and certain spectral bands are more important than others for the remote detection of marine debris. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.']"

Unfortunately, several studies have reported the presence of used face masks in marine litter in different countries around the world. Face masks produced from synthetic polymers can increase the environmental burden and contradict sustainability. This study aimed to investigate the environmental behavior of face masks when exposed to natural environmental conditions following improper disposal. New and naturally aged surgical and FFP2 masks were exposed to deionized water (DI) and sea water conditions to understand the environmental behavior of face masks when exposed to different environmental conditions. Following natural aging and DI and sea water exposure, face masks were characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and compared with new masks. According to the results, the middle layers of both mask types were exposed to more severe degradation. Aging resulted in higher microplastic (MP) release than new masks in DI and seawater for both types of face masks. Compared to new ones, aging and seawater exposure caused 11 to 13 and 14 to 22 times higher MP release from surgical and FFP2 face masks, respectively. Following seawater exposure, aged FFP2 mask released higher amounts of MP (4.36–6.20 × 106) than aged surgical masks (4.03–5.45 × 106). According to the results, a significant portion of the released MPs were <10 µm for both types of masks. However, when aged FFP2 masks were exposed to seawater, a remarkable increase was found in the fraction of 10–50 µm and 50–100 µm, suggesting that aged FFP2 masks also became fragmented in seawater conditions. FTIR and SEM analyses confirmed the transformation in the structure and chemical composition of the materials.

Therefore, this extensive usage of face masks generates million tons of plastic wastes to the environments in a short span of time. This study aims to investigate the environmental impact induced by face mask wastes and sustainable solution to reduce this waste. An online survey was carried out to identify the types of face mask and number of masks used per week by an individual from 1033 people.

However, this survey was limited with certain ages, country and durations (July–August 2020). Thus, the prediction of plastic waste generation, only provide fundamental knowledge about the mask wastes. Results revealed that there is a huge plastic waste remained in land and marine environment in the form of mask waste, which will contribute to micro-plastic pollution.

The improper disposal of face mask wastes followed by its mismanagement is a challenge to the scientists as the wastes create pollution leading to environmental degradation, especially plastic pollution (macro/meso/micro/nano).

Plastic debris was characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry. The organic contaminants were extracted from plastics by ultrasonic extraction with methanol and quantified by stir bar sorptive extraction coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In two areas, the desorption of these contaminants from plastic debris to seawater during 24 h was also evaluated. The contaminant groups considered in this study (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), personal care products (PCPs), current use pesticides (CUPs), organochlorinated compounds (OCPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorinated pesticides) and plastic additives were found in polymers from the three areas. The most abundant contaminants were plastic additives and PCPs, underlining the relevance of the leaching of plastic components, and urban and tourism activities as typical pollution sources in the coastal areas. In general, large piece-to-piece variability was found for all polymers and areas mainly as a consequence of their different origin, exposition time, use and surface-to-volume ratio. This fact difficulted the visualization of significant differences between polymers or areas, but for CUPs, whose concentrations were significantly higher in Cape Cope than in the other areas due to the influence of close agricultural activities. PCPs and CUPs were desorbed partially in seawater for 24 h, particularly the most hydrophilic compounds such as triazines and other CUPs.

PS inhibited growth of the algae cells and caused a dose-dependent effect on oxidative stress. The significantly high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced severe cell membrane damage, as confirmed by high fluorescence polarization. However, there was no obvious decrease in chlorophyll a content, and 80 mg/L of PS significantly promoted chlorophyll a synthesis.

Hydrodynamic diameter of microplastics in seawater, FITR and SEM images were used to study the changes of polystyrene during aging. The interaction of algae cell with microplastics and the cellular ultrastructure changes of cells were analyzed combined with electron microscopy for a comprehensive and systematic understanding on the mechanisms of microplastic toxicity to microalgae. Both high concentration and small size of PS had significant inhibitory effect on the growth of microalgae, and the inhibitory effect was greater with increasing exposure time. The inhibition effect of aged microplastics was more obvious, which was speculated to be caused by the synergistic effect of aged PS itself and leaching solution. The negative effect of leaching solution on microalgae was due to the release of some additives during the aging process. The content of MDA reached the highest value of 54.41 nmol/mgprot in 1.0 μm 50 mg/L A-PS treatment group, and A-PS were found to be more prone to heterogeneous aggregation with algae cells by SEM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.', 'The combined toxic effects of nanoplastics and heavy metals on aquatic organisms have attracted widespread attention; however, the results are inconsistent and the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the single and combined toxicity effects of Cu and two types of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs; 50 nm PS and 55 nm PS-COOH) on Platymonas helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis were investigated, including growth inhibition, chlorophyll content, and oxidative stress. An adverse dose-response relationship on growth inhibition was found in the Cu treatment groups, which was related to the decrease in chlorophyll content and damage to cell membranes. The growth inhibitory effect of PS-NPs on microalgae increased with exposure time and concentration, and no significant difference was found in the two types of PS-NPs because of the negligible contribution of functional groups. A more significant increase in chlorophyll content was found in PS treatments than in PS-COOH treatments at 96 h because of the microscale aggregates formed by PS. Higher concentrations (≥ 50 mg/L) of PS-NPs caused membrane lipid peroxidation, which might be responsible for growth inhibition. In the combined exposure experiments, a synergistic effect on the growth inhibition rate was obtained using the independent action model and Abbott model. Combined exposure triggered more severe oxidative damage to the microalgae. Adsorption experiment results showed that there was no adsorption between PS-NPs and Cu, while the interaction of Cu and algal cells could be promoted due to the presence of the PS-NPs, which explained the increasing combined toxicity. This study could improve our understanding of the combined toxicity of nanoplastics and heavy metals and could provide a new explanation for the mechanism of combined toxicity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.']"

Coral reefs not only serve as one of the most charismatic and biodiverse ecosystems on our planet, but also maintain the human harvesting of natural resources and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. However, the abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in coral reef systems receive little scientific attention. Meanwhile, the impacts of microplastics and nanoplastics on coral health and its potential mechanisms remain further studied. Herein, this review first summarized the current status of microplastics pollution in global coral reefs, especially included (i) abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in different media (e.g., seawater, sediment, corals), and (ii) possible sources of microplastics in reef regions. Furthermore, the main interaction mechanisms between microplastics and corals are highlighted. Following this, the direct or indirect impacts of microplastics on coral species are discussed. With the rapid increase of plastic consumption and background of pervasive global coral bleaching, research on marine microplastics must focus on the critical coral reef regions and include a comprehensive knowledge about the distribution, fate, and potential risks from an ecosystem perspective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.', ""Coral reefs are increasingly affected by the consequences of global change such as increasing temperatures or pollution. Lately, microplastics (i.e., fragments < 5 mm) have been identified as another potential threat. While previous studies have assessed short-term effects caused by high concentrations of microplastics, nothing is known about the long-term effects of microplastics under realistic concentrations. Therefore, a microcosm study was conducted and corals of the genera Acropora, Pocillopora, Porites, and Heliopora were exposed to microplastics in a concentration of 200 particles L−1, relating to predicted pollution levels. Coral growth and health, as well as symbiont properties were studied over a period of six months. The exposure caused species-specific effects on coral growth and photosynthetic performance. Signs of compromised health were observed for Acropora and Pocillopora, those taxa that frequently interact with the particles. The results indicate elevated energy demands in the affected species, likely due to physical contact of the corals to the microplastics. The study shows that microplastic pollution can have negative impacts on hermatypic corals. These effects might amplify corals' susceptibility to other stressors, further contributing to community shifts in coral reef assemblages. Microplastics have species-specific impacts on tropical reef-building corals, potentially promoting community shifts in coral reefs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"", 'The microplastic pollution has become a worldwide ecological concerns and imposed negative impacts on the coral reef ecosystems. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in the seawater, marine sediment and three scleractinian coral species (Pocillopora damicornis, Galaxea fascicularis, and Porites lutea) at five representative atolls in the Xisha Islands were investigated. The average microplastic abundances in the seawater and marine sediment were 9.5 ± 3.7 particles L−1 and 280.9 ± 231.9 particles kg−1 (dry weight), and the average contents of microplastics in P. damicornis, G. fascicularis and P. lutea were 0.9 ± 0.5 particles cm−2, 1.2 ± 0.6 particles cm−2, and 2.5 ± 1.6 particles cm−2, respectively. There were no significant correlations for the microplastic concentration between the reef environment and the corals. These results infer that the microplastic pollution is severe in the coral reef ecosystem in the Xisha Islands, and scleractinian corals could enrich microplastics from the reef environment. In addition, more than 80% of the microplastics in the seawater, marine sediment and corals were smaller than 2 mm, and the most common types of microplastics were cellophane (61.13%) and polyethylene terephthalate (33.49%). Black and fibers were the most common color and shape of the microplastics in the seawater and marine sediment, respectively. The microplastics in transparent color, film shape and small size (<2 mm) were highly accumulated in corals. Besides, cluster analysis showed that significant difference of microplastic characteristics existed between the corals and the reef environment, and the features of enriched microplastics among three coral species were also different. Moreover, P. lutea exhibited a stronger ability in enriching microplastics than G. fascicularis and P. damicornis. These results suggest that the microplastic-enriching capacities of scleractinian corals are species-specific, and species acclimated to microplastic pollution might become predominant in future coral community. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.']"

Plastic objects enter the ocean and are broken down into smaller pieces, while wastewater and runoff also carry microplastics (plastics <5 mm) into the ocean. Plastic has been found in over 700 different species of marine wildlife but little research has examined fish sold for human consumption. We determined the microplastic abundance in nine commercially important, wild-caught fish species purchased from seafood markets across 4000 km of Australia (Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales). For microplastic quantification, fish gastro-intestinal tracts were chemically digested and the amount and type of microplastic identified under a microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Across all states, an average of 35.5% of fish samples had at least one piece of microplastic in their gastro-intestinal tract. South Australia had the highest percentage of fish with plastic (49%) and Tasmania the lowest (20%). The average microplastic load was 0.94 piece per fish but ranged from 0 to 17 pieces, with polyolefin identified as the dominant polymer group. Overall, the ingestion of microplastic was widespread across species, locations, diets and habitat niches of fish species investigated, but the average plastic ingestion was less than other similar global studies.

In this study, we quantified plastic debris ingestion by marine fish in the coastal waters of the Hengchun Peninsula, including the Kenting National park, located in southern Taiwan. We also investigated possible biotic and abiotic factors associated with the quantity of ingested plastic by fish. In the 117 fish samples we examined, 94.87% of them had ingested plastic debris, and all of the observed debris was microplastics (<5 mm). The average number of ingested microplastics was 5.6 ± 5.1 pieces per fish (ranged 0–32 pieces per fish). The major type and color of microplastics were fiber (96%) and blue (43%), respectively. The quantity of ingested microplastics was not significantly different between the reef and pelagic fish. However, reef fish from the more populated west and south coast ingested more microplastics than that from the east coast, suggesting that microplastic ingestion by fish is related to human activity. Regarding biotic factors, the size, trophic level, and taxonomic family of the fish were not significantly associated with the number of ingested microplastics. Our results, the first investigation of microplastic ingestion in marine fish of Taiwan, show a high prevalence of microplastic ingestion but no biomagnification of microplastics in the fish.

The average abundance of mesoplastics varied from 0.2 to 3.0 items by individual and 0.1–3.9 items by gram. Microplastics were abundant in 26 species, accounting for 55.9–92.3% of the total number of plastics items in each species. Thamnaconus septentrionalis contained the highest abundance of microplastics (7.2 items/individual). The average abundance of plastics in sea benthopelagic fishes was significantly higher than in freshwater benthopelagic fishes by items/individual. The plastics were dominanted by fiber in shape, transparent in color and cellophane in composition. The proportion of plastics in the stomach to the intestines showed great variation in different species, ranging from 0.5 to 1.9 by items/individual. The stomach of Harpodon nehereus and intestines of Pampus cinereus contained the highest number of plastics, (3.3) and (2.7), respectively, by items/individual. Our results suggested that plastic pollution was widespread in the investigated fish species and showed higher abundance in comparison with worldwide studies. The ingestion of plastics in fish was closely related to the habitat and gastrointestinal tract structure.

At present, research on microplastic pollution in the atmospheric environment has been carried out only in limited regions. Here, the long-term variation in atmospheric microplastic pollution in different coastal cities around the Bohai Sea was compared by selecting three coastal cities (Yantai, Tianjin and Dalian) as case studies. Atmospheric deposition samples were collected from June 2018 to May 2019. The particle size, color, micro-morphology and components of atmospheric microplastics were characterized by stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and μ-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and the atmospheric deposition flux of microplastics was also calculated. Four types of microplastics comprising fibers, films, fragments and granules were found in the atmospheric deposition samples at the three sampling sites and were dominated by fibers (>90%). The colors of microplastics were mainly transparent, blue, red, and black. Most microplastics were < 1 mm in size and the main components of the identified microplastics were cellophane (>50%) and polyester terephthalate (>30%). All the atmospheric microplastics showed definite surface weathering characteristics. The annual atmospheric deposition flux of microplastics at Yantai, Tianjin and Dalian were 2.7×104, 8.9×104 and 7.2×104 particles per square meter, respectively.

The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs’ potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m–2 d–1 or 0 to 1583 n m–3. The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs’ shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What’s noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs’ transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs’ environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts. It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Existing studies on atmospheric MPs are mostly derived from collection of atmospheric deposition, whereas direct measurements of airborne MPs are scarce. However, the abundance of airborne MPs is more relevant for evaluating human inhalation exposure risk. Herein, airborne MPs in indoor and outdoor environments from urban and rural areas of a coastal city in eastern China were investigated. MP concentrations (mean±SD) in indoor air (1583 ± 1180 n/m3) were an order of magnitude higher than outdoor air (189 ± 85 n/m3), and airborne MP concentrations in urban areas (224 ± 70 n/m3) were higher than rural areas (101 ± 47 n/m3). MPs smaller than 100 µm dominated airborne MPs, and the predominant shape of airborne MPs was fragments, as opposed to fibers. The larger MP size fractions contained a higher proportion of fibers, whereas the smaller size fractions were nearly exclusively composed of fragments. The health risk caused by ubiquitous airborne MPs should not be discounted as the maximum annual outdoor exposure of airborne MPs can reach 1 million/year, while indoor exposure may be even higher due to higher indoor airborne MP concentrations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.']"

By 2050, a high volume of plastic production will be responsible for up to 13 % of our planet's total carbon budget. The global emissions of GHG and their persistence in the environment have depleted Earth's residual carbon resources and have generated an alarming feedback loop. Each year at least 8 million tonnes of discarded plastics are entering our oceans, creating concerns regarding plastic toxicity on marine biota as they end up in the food chain and ultimately affect human health. The unsuccessful management of plastic waste and its presence on the riverbanks, coastlines, and landscapes leads to the emission of a higher percentage of GHG in the atmosphere. The persistence of microplastics is also a significant threat to the fragile and extreme ecosystem containing diverse life forms with low genetic variation, making them vulnerable to climatic change. In this review, we have categorically discussed the contribution of plastic and plastic waste to global climate change covering the current plastic production and future trends, the types of plastics and plastic materials used globally, plastic lifecycle and GHG emission, and how microplastics become a major threat to ocean carbon sequestration and marine health.

Our analysis revealed alarming trends, such as the significant increase in plastic production since the 1950s and the projected estimate of up to 12,000 million metric tons of plastic waste in the natural environment by 2050. Additionally, we found that more than 1000 rivers account for 80% of global annual emissions, with Asia contributing the highest estimate of plastic emissions, followed by Africa, South America, North America, Europe, and Oceania. Furthermore, our findings showed that the largest contributors to ocean plastic waste are macroplastics, mesoplastics, and microplastics, with small microplastics dominating the percentage of surface ocean plastic by particle count. The recycling and reuse of waste plastics implement the concept of sustainable development of recycling and offsets the carbon emissions in the environment, potentially obtaining more carbon credits.

It has often been suggested that plastic particles in the 100 nm size range as defined earlier for nanomaterials (here referred to as �nanoplastics�), may be emitted to or formed in the aquatic environment. Nanoplastics is probably the least known area of marine litter but potentially also the most hazardous. This paper provides the first review on sources, effects and hazards of nanoplastics. Detection methods are in an early stage of development and to date no nanoplastics have actually been detected in natural aquatic systems. Various sources of nanoplastics have been suggested such as release from products or nanofragmentation of larger particles. Nanoplastic fate studies for rivers show an important role for sedimentation of heteroaggregates, similar to that for non-polymer nanomaterials. Some prognostic effect studies have been performed but effect thresholds seem higher than nanoplastic concentrations expected in the environment. The high surface area of nanoplastics may imply that toxic chemicals are retained by nanoplastics, possibly increasing overall hazard. Release of non-polymer nanomaterial additives from small product fragments may add to the hazard of nanoplastics. Because of the presence of such co-contaminants, effect studies with nanoplastics pose some specific practical challenges.

The aging of MPs is influenced by several processes including photodegradation, thermal degradation, biodegradation and mechanical fragmentation, which affect their interaction with contaminants. This comprehensive review aims to summarize the aging process of MPs and the factors that impact their aging, and to discuss the effects of aging on the interaction of MPs with contaminants. A range of characterization methods that can effectively elucidate the mechanistic processes of these interactions are outlined. The rate and extent of MPs aging are influenced by their physicochemical properties and other environmental factors, which ultimately affect the adsorption and aggregation of aged MPs with environmental contaminants. Pollutants such as heavy metals, organic matter and microorganisms have a tendency to accumulate on MPs through adsorption and the interactions between them impact their environmental behavior. Aging enhances the specific surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups of MPs, thereby affecting the mechanism of interaction between MPs and contaminants. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of how aging affects the interactions, this review also provides an overview of the mechanisms by which MPs interact with contaminants. In the future, there should be further in-depth studies of the potential hazards of aged MPs in different environments e.g., soil, sediment, aquatic environment, and effects of their interaction with environmental pollutants on human health and ecology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.', 'In this study, the adsorption behavior of lead (Pb(II)) onto environmentally-relevant tire wear particles (TWP) gained by natural weathering and mechanical abrasion, ultraviolet-aged polylactic acid microplastics (UV-PLA), and ultraviolet-aged polystyrene microplastics (UV-PS) was compared to investigate the difference of representative microplastics between the adsorption capacity and mechanism. Our results indicated that the aging processes significantly improved the adsorption capacity to Pb(II), and TWP had the highest adsorption amount, followed the order by UV-PLA, UV-PS, PLA and PS. Electrostatic interaction and complexation of oxygen-containing functional groups played crucial roles in the adsorption of Pb(II) onto UV-PLA, the adsorption mechanisms of UV-PS involved electrostatic interaction, complexation and cation-π interaction, while adsorption of TWP was might dominated by the complexation of surface functional groups and properties of the complex rubber co-polymer. Interestingly, the low concentration of humic acid (HA) most significantly improved adsorption capacity of aged microplastics to Pb(II), otherwise it was severely suppressed at higher concentration of HA. Besides, the adsorption behavior of different binary systems between aged microplastics and suspended sediment to Pb(II) had complicated synergistic or suppressive effects with a concentration-dependent and polymer-dependent trend. Furthermore, UV-PLA had the far stronger desorption ability of Pb(II) than that of TWP and UV-PS, suggesting that metal-contaminated biodegradable microplastics posed the higher ecological risks to aquatic organisms. Desorption quantity and rates of Pb(II) from aged microplastics in the simulated sediment system were generally higher than those in turbulent water column.

Weathering starts before or after MPs enter stormwater and is more pronounced on land due to continuous heat and mechanical stress. Land use patterns, rainfall intensity, MPs size and density, and drainage characteristics influence the transport of MPs in stormwater.

However, recent studies found that in the investigated locations, the proportion of MPs from aquaculture even exceeded that from terrigenous input. Thus, the contribution of aquaculture activities to the abundance of MPs in coastal waters might be substantially underestimated. Fishing nets, foam buoys and other plastic products are widely used in aquaculture. They gradually disintegrate and finally release a large number of MPs into local water environments under long-term ultraviolet radiation and wind-wave action. Aquaculture activities such as feeding, processing, and packaging also release MPs into the water environments. These released MPs are defined as aquaculture-derived microplastics (AD-MPs). Currently, a large number of AD-MPs have been detected in different coastal waters, even accounting for 99.00% of the total MPs at some aquaculture areas. These results demonstrate that AD-MPs in coastal waters have become an important and non-negligible issue in MPs pollution. What’s more, MPs in waters and sediments can be ingested by aquatic organisms, adversely affecting the species, and subsequently displaying potential threats to human health via food chains. Since mariculture has become one of the major sources of seafoods, it is necessary to investigate the pollution of AD-MPs in cultured seafood. This review summarized the levels and characteristics of MPs in cultured organisms from different coastal waters. The results indicate that MPs have widely detected in cultured seafood all over the world, suggesting that the pollution of MPs in cultured seafood cannot be ignored, though the proportion of AD-MPs in the total MPs in mariculture species is still unclear. Given that mariculture activities could release a large number of MPs (AD-MPs), cultured marine organisms would absorb and accumulate MPs more easily than wildlife. To further identify the pollution of AD-MPs in cultured seafood, the levels and characteristics of MPs in cultured and wild bivalves and shellfish were compared. The results showed that MPs were detected in both, while the abundance of MPs in wild shellfish was generally lower than that in cultured ones, reflecting that AD-MPs are an important source of MPs in cultured seafood. Our review confirmed that AD-MPs are an important source of MPs in both coastal waters and cultured seafood. It would facilitate the scientific assessment of the ecological and health risks of AD-MPs, and provide helpful data to guide the use and management of plastic products in mariculture industries. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.', 'Microplastic (MP) contamination has been well documented across a range of habitats and for a large number of organisms in the marine environment. Consequently, bioaccumulation, and in particular biomagnification of MPs and associated chemical additives, are often inferred to occur in marine food webs. Presented here are the results of a systematic literature review to examine whether current, published findings support the premise that MPs and associated chemical additives bioaccumulate and biomagnify across a general marine food web. First, field and laboratory-derived contamination data on marine species were standardised by sample size from a total of 116 publications. Second, following assignment of each species to one of five main trophic levels, the average uptake of MPs and of associated chemical additives was estimated across all species within each level. These uptake data within and across the five trophic levels were then critically examined for any evidence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Findings corroborate previous studies that MP bioaccumulation occurs within each trophic level, while current evidence around bioaccumulation of associated chemical additives is much more ambiguous. In contrast, MP biomagnification across a general marine food web is not supported by current field observations, while results from the few laboratory studies supporting trophic transfer are hampered by using unrealistic exposure conditions. Further, a lack of both field and laboratory data precludes an examination of potential trophic transfer and biomagnification of chemical additives associated with MPs. Combined, these findings indicate that, although bioaccumulation of MPs occurs within trophic levels, no clear sign of MP biomagnification in situ was observed at the higher trophic levels. Recommendations for future studies to focus on investigating ingestion, retention and depuration rates for MPs and chemical additives under environmentally realistic conditions, and on examining the potential of multi-level trophic transfer for MPs and chemical additives have been made.  © 2020 Miller et al.

A large variety of aquatic taxa ingest MPs, but the extent to which animals accumulate and transfer MPs through food webs is largely unknown. In this study, we quantified MP uptake in bivalves, crabs, echinoderms, and fish feeding at different trophic levels at three sites on southern Vancouver Island. We paired stable-isotope food web analysis with MP concentrations in digestive tracts across all trophic levels and in fish livers. We then used Bayesian generalized linear mixed models to explore whether bioaccumulation and biomagnification were occurring. Our results showed that MPs (100–5000 μm along their longest dimension) are not biomagnifying in marine coastal food webs, with no correlation between the digestive tract or fish liver MP concentrations and trophic position of the various species. Ecological traits did, however, affect microplastic accumulation in digestive tracts, with suspension feeder and smaller-bodied planktivorous fish ingesting more MPs by body weight. Trophic transfer occurred between prey and predator for rockfish, but higher concentrations in full stomachs compared with empty ones suggested rapid excretion of ingested MPs. Collectively, our findings suggested the movement of MP through marine food webs is facilitated by species-specific mechanisms, with contamination susceptibility a function of species biology, not trophic position. Furthermore, the statistical methods we employ, including machine learning for classifying unknown particles and a probabilistic way to account for background contamination, are universally applicable to the study of microplastics. Our findings advance understanding of how MPs enter and move through aquatic food webs, suggesting that lower-trophic-level animals are more at risk of ingesting >100-μm MPs, relative to higher-trophic-level animals. Our work also highlights the need to advance the study of <100-μm MPs, which are still poorly understood and may need to be considered separately in ecological risk assessments. © 2022 The Authors.

Due to the lipophilic characteristics of plastics, oil extraction as a fast and density-independent separation process is beneficial for the crucial extraction step. It was extensively validated (480 experiments) in two test setups by using canola oil and a cost-effective, plastic-free separation unit with spiked microplastics (19 different polymer types) in the density range from ρ = 11-1760 kg m-3 and in the size range from 0.02-4.4 mm. Thus, an innovative, new method combination was developed and profoundly validated for water and sediment samples using only a short settling time of 15 minutes. Some experiments were also carried out with zinc chloride to obtain additional reference data (particles ≤ 359 μm). The total mean recovery rate was 89.3%, 91.7% within the larger microplastic fraction and 85.7% for the small fraction. Compared to zinc chloride (87.6%), recovery rates differed not significantly with oil (87.1%). Furthermore, size limits were set, since the method works best with particles 0.02 mm ≥ d ≤ 3 mm. The proposed method exhibits higher efficiency (84.8% for 20-63 μm) for the potentially most harmful microplastic size fraction than the classic setup using brine solution. As a result, oil is a comparably effective separation medium and offers further advantages for separating water and sediment samples due to its density independence, simple and fast application and environmental friendliness. Based on this, a new extraction protocol is presented here that confirms oil separation as a sound and effective separation process in microplastic analysis and identifies previously missing information. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.', 'A method with the potential for comprehensive microplastic monitoring in river sediments is presented in this study. We introduce a novel combination of electrostatic separation, density separation, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Currently, microplastic analysis in sediments is limited in terms of sample masses, processing time, and analytical robustness. This work evaluated a method to process large sample masses efficiently and still obtain robust results. Four particulate matrices, including commercial sands and river sediments, were spiked with PCL, LD-PE, and PET microplastic particles (63–200\xa0µm). Samples with a mass of 100\xa0g and 1,000\xa0g (sand only) contained 75\xa0mg of each microplastic. After electrostatic separation, the mass of sand samples was reduced by 98%. Sediment samples showed a mass reduction of 70–78%. After density separation, the total mass reduction of sediment samples was above 99%. The increased concentration of total organic carbon seems to have the highest impact on mass reduction by electrostatic separation. Nevertheless, the recovery of microplastic was independent of the particulate matrix and was polymer-specific. In 100\xa0g samples, the average recovery rates for PCL, LD-PE, and PET were 74 ± 9%, 93 ± 9%, and 120 ± 18%, respectively. The recoveries of microplastic from 1,000\xa0g samples were 50 ± 8%, 114 ± 9%, and 82 ± 11%, respectively. In scale up experiments, high recoveries of all microplastics were observed with a decrease in standard deviation. Moreover, the biodegradable polymer PCL could be used as an internal standard to provide quality assurance of the process. This method can overcome the current limitations of routine microplastic analysis in particulate matrices. We conclude that this method can be applied for comprehensive microplastic monitoring in highly polluted sediments. More studies on electrostatic separation and polymer-specific recovery rates in complex matrices are proposed.

Section 3.2 contains paragraphs written in the original draft and not revised by the authors before the final submission. A correction has been made to Section 3.2 Analytical Approaches for MP Separation, Identification, and Quantification. The corrected version is as follows: “Several analytical methods have been developed to measure MP in water and the most important procedures include separation, identification, and quantification. Separation of microplastics is usually achieved by sieves with mesh sizes from 0.038 to 4.75 mm, used singly or in a series. Moreover, filters with small mesh sizes (0.02–5 µm) are also used to separate small microplastics or nanoplastics [50,249]. For plastic particles <1 µm, chromatographic techniques, active, and passive separation, are typically used. Active separations, such as the field flow fractionation (FFF) technique [250], apply external fields into microfluidic environments for the separation of dispersed particles, while passive separations, such as hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) [251], utilize hydrodynamic and surface forces to separate particles in liquid [252]. The extraction process is usually based on the different densities of the samples. When MPs are less dense than water, they can be directly separated using a net or filtered by filters or sieves [67]. Flotation is preferred with sediments. Low density plastics have a density range from 0.9 to 2.3 g/cm3, while the density of sediments and soil particles is higher (2.6–2.7 g/cm3). High density salt solutions such as ZnCl2, ZnBr2, NaCl, NaI, and CaCl2 allow MPs to float and be separated from sediments that sink [253,254]. While this method is efficient for low-density microplastics, high-density microplastics such as polyvinyl chloride and polytetrafluoroethylene cannot be easily recovered. In order to separate plastics and organic matter from the minerals in the mixture solution after centrifugation, a rubber disc is inserted into the middle of a centrifuge tube. This expedient can prevent mineral particles from being resuspended, substantially reducing separation time [255]. Moreover, a high amount of organic matter could affect separation from MPs; for this reason, acid solvents, alkali solvents, or oxidation agents, including KClO (30%), NaOH (56% or 52.5 M), H2SO4 (96%), HNO3 (65% or 22.5 M), and H2O2 (30% or 32.6 M), have been used to digest and remove organic matter from flotation [255]. However, a recent study demonstrated that many of these agents decompose, disintegrate, or modify the weight, number, and shapes of MP particles [256]. Polyamide (PA), polyester (PET), and polycarbonate (PC) have a low resistance to strong acids. PA, polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) are resistant to 10% KOH, but polycarbonate (PC) and PET are degraded. Treatment with NaOH 40% at T = 60 °C caused deformation of PA fibers, yellowing of PVC granules, and melding of polyethylene particles. Enzymatic digestion is a biological means to hydrolyze proteins and break tissues. Enzymes ensure no loss or degradation of plastics; however, enzymatic digestion can be long and expensive [257]. The quantification of MPs is still a major challenge, due to their special chemical and physical properties (very high molecular weights and poor solubility in most solvents). MPs cannot be analyzed by classical analytical methods such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography tandem-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Table 3 outlines the main analytical techniques employed for MP detection, advanced visualization, and counting, focusing on the operation principles, advantages, and disadvantages of each method. Basically, two different analytical strategies have been discussed in recent publications [258–261]. The first one is based on the isolation of MP particles by density separation and spectroscopic identification [82,262,263] through Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, available in transmission, reflectance, and attenuated total reflectance, ATR) or Raman Spectroscopy. The reflectance and ATR modes do not require sample preparation steps for thick and opaque microplastics [264]. These methods deliver information about polymer species, particle numbers, and size distribution [265], important parameters used to estimate the microplastics’ toxicological potential. Raman method spectroscopy (<125 mm and >5 mass%) [266], micro-Raman spectroscopy (>100 µm), micro-FTIR spectroscopy (>100 µm) [267], m-Raman spectroscopy (>1 mm), m-FTIR spectroscopy (>10 mm) [268], macroscopic dimensioned near-infrared (NIR) in combination with chemometrics (>10 mm and 1 mass%) [266], and hyperspectral imaging technology (0.5–5 mm) can be used to identify plastics type, but these techniques are time-consuming, and they can be expensive and result in an uncertain extrapolation of MP quantity [269]. For example, the ATR mode produces stable spectra even from irregular microplastic surfaces; however, a lot of microplastics are weathered or made of complex materials, thus an experienced operator is necessary for the acquisition and interpretation of the spectra. Moreover, the probe used in ATR is made of germanium and can be easily damaged by hard and sharp particles remaining on filter papers [264]. The Raman signal is suitable for particles below 20 µm, but the spectra are heavily influenced by dyes, additives, and organic and inorganic substances. In addition, some materials exhibit fluorescence, masking the vibrational information [270]. The second strategy is based on thermal decomposition coupled to mass spectrometry, which is more suitable for MP quantification. Unice et al. [253] developed a method for polymers of tires (sample amount of 0.5 mg) using pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyr-GC-MS). Quantification was based on specific pyrolysis products and deuterated internal standards. The method needed only minor sample preparations and yielded a limit of detection of 14 µg/g of tire tread in soil and sediments. For the quantification of thermoplastics, Duemichen et al. [254] described a combination of thermal extraction with thermogravimetric analysis and subsequent analysis with thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TDS-GC-MS) that required a sample quantity of more than 20 mg. After pyrolysis at 600 °C and enrichment of the degradation products on solid-phase absorbers, plastic species were quantified by GC-MS analysis detecting polymer-specific decomposition products [271]. The deficiencies of these methods are the expense of the equipment and the complicated operation process. Identification of microplastics passes through visualization analysis to characterize the color, shape, and light transmission, using naked eyes or analytical methodologies like optical microscopy [34,272,273]. Different microscopy techniques can be used according to the dimension and the physical properties of the MP samples. A stereomicroscope, thanks to two separated optical paths, allows for obtaining three-dimensional images of a specimen. Polarized light microscopy permits the acquisition of images at different heights [274]. Electron microscopy is useful for ambiguous particles [275,276]. In particular, electron microscopy coupled with X-ray (SEM-EDS) is a useful analytical technique to obtain high-resolution and chemical information and can identify plastic particles in complex matrices. Despite the efficiency of this technique for the chemical and morphological characterization of particles, there are some disadvantages associated with SEM-EDS analysis, such as a long time for the sample preparation and analysis, instability of some polymers, complex protocols for the analysis, and high costs of instrumentation [252]. Recently, new advanced techniques have been proposed for the characterization of microplastics, and sometimes, microplastics were produced in the laboratory to obtain standard reference materials. Monteleone et al. [277] used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to characterize microplastics. Several kinds of microplastics produced with a cryogenic swilling mill, with and without heat treatment, were subjected to FLIM with excitation wavelengths of 470 nm and 440 nm. The fluorescence lifetimes of each microplastic were evaluated and compared and no significant differences emerged in the fluorescence lifetimes of PET samples coming from different countries; therefore, the lifetimes measured did not depend on the origin of the microplastics. Berto et al. [278] reported a preliminary characterization of carbon stable isotopes (13δ) of different plastic polymers. Stable isotope analysis is a technique that measures the relative abundance of stable isotopes giving an isotopic ratio that can be used as a research tool. It is widely used in food analysis [279,280], in forensic cases [281], and in medical diagnostics [282] for the monitoring of indoor and outdoor air quality [283,284] and the characterization of commercial cleaning products [285]. This technique has been applied only rarely to assess the presence of microplastics. A proof-of-concept study was performed with fully labeled 13C polyethylene to follow its fate across the aquatic microbial–animal interface. It emerged that the biodegradation of PE-MPs (<100 µm) occurred in natural waters, becoming part of nutritionally valuable biomolecules for aquatic organisms [286]. In [278,287], standard petroleum and plant-derived polymers were analyzed to estimate the carbon isotope ratio. The 13δ values of several polymers spanned over a wide range: PTFE, silicon, and ABS showed 13δ values between −41% and −35%, petroleum polymers had 13 values between −34% and −24%, and PLA (a biodegradable polyester derived from the fermentation of starch and condensation of lactic acid) had a value of −14%. Thus, this technique showed an interesting perspective for the discrimination between petroleum and plant-derived polymers in aquatic environments. Furthermore, unlike vibrational spectroscopy techniques such as Raman, it is not sensitive to variables such as colors. Another analytical method includes high temperature gel-permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) coupled with an IR detector. HT-GPC-IR can assess polyolefin microbeads in aqueous environments and more complex matrices such as personal care products [288] and also gives the distribution of molecular masses. In conclusion, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy are commonly used for identifying the polymeric composition of microplastics, whereas mass spectrometry-based methodologies, even though they require a lower amount of sample, are more expensive and trickier to operate. The same can be said by comparing optical microscopy, the most used technique for microplastic visualization, with the most advanced techniques such as SEM-EDS. Consequently, interlaboratory analyses should be performed to provide comparability of data regarding the chemical characterization and quantification of microplastics. In fact, the use of one technique can only lead to the overestimation or underestimation of microplastics. Fragmented microplastics were underestimated and fibers were overestimated using stereomicroscopy compared to FTIR in samples coming from sea surface microlayers and beach sand. The total abundance by FT-IR was higher than by microscopy both in the sea surface microlayers and beach sand samples. Stereomicroscopy mainly allowed for the identification of 50–100 µm fragmented microplastics, while FTIR also identified smaller sizes [289]. Therefore, in Scheme 1, we reported a possible simple protocol for the identification of microplastics in aqueous samples that can include a first preparation step of the sample (identification of organic matter presence with the preliminary treatment of degradation), separation with sieves with different mesh sizes, a visualization step with a microscope to count and estimate the sizes of the MPs, and in the end, a screening with FT-IR or Raman to identify the chemical composition of the MPs. Although new accurate and sophisticated analytical methods have been reported for microplastic detection and characterization, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy remain those commonly used for identifying the polymeric composition of microplastics due to their inexpensiveness and user-friendliness.” The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected.

Various factors contribute to the degradation of HDPE in marine environments, including UV radiation, seawater hydrolysis, biodegradation, and mechanical stress. Despite their supposed long lifespans, there is still a lack of understanding about the long-term degradation mechanisms that cause weathering of seawater-exposed HDPE products. In this research, the impact of UV radiation on the degradation of HDPE pile sleeves was studied in natural as well as laboratory settings to isolate the UV effect. After nine years of exposure to the marine environment in natural settings, the HDPE pile sleeves exhibited an increase in oxygen-containing surface functional groups and more morphological changes compared to accelerated UVB irradiation in the laboratory. This indicated that combined non-UV mechanisms may play a major role in HDPE degradation than UV irradiation alone. However, UVB irradiation was found to release dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen from HDPE pile sleeves, reaching levels of up to 15 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively. Our findings underscore the significance of taking into account both UV and non-UV degradation mechanisms when evaluating the role of HDPE in contributing to marine plastic pollution. © 2024 The Authors', 'In order to solve the problem of marine microplastics and realize the harmless resource utilization of plastics, the gasification experiments of polycarbonate (PC) microplastics were carried out in supercritical water and a novel seawater gasification of microplastic experiment was investigated. In this paper, the effects of different operating conditions (temperature, time, feedstock concentration, pressure) on gasification performance were discussed. The gasification kinetic of microplastics in supercritical water was calculated. The experimental results showed that the increase in gasification temperature and time enhanced the cracking reaction and free radical reaction of the microplastics to increase the gasification efficiency, while the reduction in feedstock concentration improved the gasification efficiency by increasing the gasification level of unit feedstock. The change in pressure had no significant effect on gasification due to the fact that the properties of the supercritical water were not significantly changed. It was found that the valuable results that all alkali metal salts in seawater promote hydrogen conversion, while in terms of carbon conversion, only KCl, CaCl2, NaHCO3 and seawater had a significant catalytic effect on the gasification. Seawater gasification of microplastics was a potential resource utilization method. Finally, it was considered that the PC plastic gasification conformed to the random nucleation and subsequent growth model (n = 3), and the reaction activation energy was 230.45 kJ/mol, which was smaller than that of traditional pyrolysis. © 2019 Energy Institute', 'Plastic debris represents one of the most prevalent and persistent pollution problems in the marine environment. In particular, microplastics that are mainly degraded from larger plastic debris have become a growing environmental concern. However, studies on the degradation of plastics in the aquatic environment that hydrobios reside in have been limited, while several studies regarding the degradation of plastics have been conducted under outdoor or accelerated weathering conditions. Thus, observation of the degradation of three types of virgin plastic pellets exposed to UV irradiation in three different environments (i.e., simulated seawater, ultrapure water, and a waterless (air) condition) was carried out. Data on the changes in physical and chemical properties were collected. The FTIR spectra showed that hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups developed in three types of weathered plastic pellets under the air and ultrapure water environmental conditions after 3 months of UV irradiation, while only carbonyl groups were found in plastic pellets in the simulated seawater environment. In contrast, the Raman spectra showed no significant changes in the weathered plastic pellets, but there were different intensities of characteristic peaks after exposure to UV irradiation. In addition, SEM images illustrated that granular oxidation, cracks and flakes were common patterns during degradation, and the plastic pellets in the three different environments experienced different levels of chemical weathering.

Plastic pieces in smaller size scales, microplastics (particles <5mm), have reached high densities (e.g., 100000 items per m3) in waters and sediments, and are interacting with organisms and the environment in a variety of ways. Early investigations of freshwater systems suggest microplastic presence and interactions are equally as far reaching as are being observed in marine systems. Microplastics are being detected in freshwaters of Europe, North America, and Asia, and the first organismal studies are finding that freshwater fauna across a range of feeding guilds ingest microplastics.Drawing from the marine literature and these initial freshwater studies, we review the issue of microplastics in freshwater systems to summarise current understanding, identify knowledge gaps and suggest future research priorities. Evidence suggests that freshwater systems may share similarities to marine systems in the types of forces that transport microplastics (e.g. surface currents); the prevalence of microplastics (e.g. numerically abundant and ubiquitous); the approaches used for detection, identification and quantification (e.g. density separation, filtration, sieving and infrared spectroscopy); and the potential impacts (e.g. physical damage to organisms that ingest them, chemical transfer of toxicants). Differences between freshwater and marine systems include the closer proximity to point sources in freshwaters, the typically smaller sizes of freshwater systems, and spatial and temporal differences in the mixing/transport of particles by physical forces. These differences between marine and freshwater systems may lead to differences in the type of microplastics present. For example, rivers may show a predictable pattern in microplastic characteristics (size, shape, relative abundance) based on waste sources (e.g. household vs. industrial) adjacent to the river, and distance downstream from a point source.Given that the study of microplastics in freshwaters has only arisen in the last few years, we are still limited in our understanding of 1) their presence and distribution in the environment; 2) their transport pathways and factors that affect distributions; 3) methods for their accurate detection and quantification; 4) the extent and relevance of their impacts on aquatic life. We also do not know how microplastics might transfer from freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems, and we do not know if and how they may affect human health. This is concerning because human populations have a high dependency on freshwaters for drinking water and for food resources. Increasing the level of understanding in these areas is essential if we are to develop appropriate policy and management tools to address this emerging issue. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.', 'Microplastic particles (<5 mm) are ubiquitous throughout global marine ecosystems, including the deep sea. Ingestion of microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles is reported in diverse marine taxa across trophic levels. Trophic transfer, or the movement of microplastics across trophic levels, is reported in laboratory studies but not yet widely measured in marine food webs. The Monterey Bay submarine canyon ecosystem contains a well-studied, known deep-sea food web in which to examine the trophic fate of microplastics. We measured microplastic abundance across 17 genera spanning approximately 5 trophic levels and a diversity of feeding behaviors. Samples were collected using remotely operated vehicles and oblique midwater trawls, and gut contents of all individuals examined (n = 157) were analyzed for microplastic abundance and other anthropogenic particles greater than 100 μm using stereo microscopy. Microparticles were analyzed with Raman spectroscopy to confirm material type. Anthropogenic particles were found in all genera examined, across crustacean, fish, mollusk, and gelatinous organisms, in amounts ranging from 0 to 24 particles per individual. There was no significant relationship between microplastic amount and fish trophic level, suggesting that the trophic transfer of microparticles is not occurring. Body size was positively correlated with microplastic abundance across all taxa. The fish genus Scomber sp. drove this relationship, suggesting higher microparticle abundance in mobile individuals with broad horizontal distributions. Future work should examine physiological pathways for microplastic transport within organisms (e.g. excretion, accumulation on gills, internal translocation of particles) and between organisms within shared habitats to more fully understand the fate of microplastics within aquatic food webs.  © 2021 The authors.', 'Microplastics are ubiquitous, persistent pollutants that are reported in abundance within the marine environment. Their presence in seawater and marine sediments poses a legitimate environmental and ecological concern for toxicity and food chain transfer via marine organisms. Their capability for sorption of other hydrophobic contaminants and the inability of the wastewater treatment plants to completely remove them pose additional risks. This review highlights the methodologies for sampling, sample preparation, and identification used in the Persian/Arabian Gulf region, which is possibly one of the least studied marginal seas with only sixteen papers published on microplastics. The review highlights the several orders of magnitude variations in microplastic concentrations among different studies; e.g. in seawater, only 12 microplastic particles were reported from 40 transects of one km length in Kuwait to 0.71 microplastics m−3 in Qatar. Concentrations in beach sediments also show the significant difference between the northern and southern Gulf coasts, with 13 particles in 24 samples reported in Qatar, and 15 particles within 44 samples across Kuwait, to 3252 ± 2766 particles m−2 from Bandar Abbas, Iran. The biota samples also show similar variances, with only three particles identified from 87 gut samples in Kuwait to 828 particles in 58 samples that include 46 fish and 12 shrimps from Iran. Some extremely high concentrations in biota are also reported from Iran, with concentrations as high as 0.251 particles g−1 of muscle and 0.931 particles g−1 in gills. It is evident that there is no consensus in the Gulf region on the sampling techniques (mesh size of plankton nets and sieves), use of fluidization solutions and very different units used in data reporting such as particles m−3 and particles m−2 in water samples. In sediments units like particles g−1 and particles m−2 have been used, and for biota it is the number of particles present in the sample, while others have quantified data as particles g−1 of tissue. Considering the higher densities of PET, PVC, nylon and polyester than seawater, they are likely to migrate downwards into marine sediments, a transfer process that has not been studied in detail. Thus the review underscores the need to adopt harmonized protocols for microplastic studies in the region, and identifies certain aspects of microplastics that require further study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd']"

It is considered as one of the most basic materials for the development of modern society. Most of the plastic produced are used for packaging and disposable products. Due to the high disposable rate and mismanagement, a large amount of plastic debris enters the marine environment. Potentially lasting several hundred years in the environment, the large plastic debris can be continuously broken into microplastics which are smaller than 5 mm under the action of ultraviolet light, heat, wind, tide, wave and bacteria etc. Therefore, the amount of microplastics will keep rising in the ocean. Microplastics is considered as a new emerging pollutant and has become a global concern. Understanding the degradation process of plastic in the environment is important for evaluating the contribution of plastic debris as one microplastics source. In this work, polyethylene film from 6 kinds of packaging bags commonly used in our daily life, i.e., food packing bag, garbage bag, thick film, and express packing bag, were selected to carry out photodegradation experiment under ultraviolet radiation in the laboratory. Properties of plastic films were investigated by tensile tests, infra-red spectrometry and scanning electron microscope at various time intervals. The results showed that the elongation-at-break of six kinds of polyethylene film decreased with increasing of UV exposure time. While Young's modulus showed a trend of increase-decrease with increasing exposure time in general. The yield strength showed a general increasing-decreasing or decreasing trend with increasing exposure time. PE films from food packing bag and degradable garbage bag became brittle and tended to break into microplasics after 36 h under UV irradiation of 160 W/m2. However, the retained elongation-at-break of PE film from express packing bag was up to 76% after 180 h UV irradiation. Chain scission and structure changes occurred during photodegradation process. FT-IR spectra indicated that difference existed in photodegraded process among PE films from six kinds of plastic bags. Ether group existed in FT-IR spectra of PE film from food packing bag, while ketone, ester, carboxylic acid, and vinyl group appeared in the spectra of thick film and express packing bag. Carbonyl index, crystallinity index and vinyl index of films from food packing bag, thick film and express packing bag increased at various degrees with prolongation of exposure time. The microstructure at tensile fracture surface became smoother after photodegradation, showing appearance of small fragments. This indicated that the intermolecular force decreased significantly, which was consistent with the trend of mechanical properties. The plastic packing bags commonly used in our daily life tend to become brittle and fragment into small pieces under ultraviolet radiation and become one source of microplastics in environment. These results can provide basic data and theoretical support for study of environmental behavior processes of plastic debris and source of microplastics, assessment of environmental risk, etc. © 2021, Science Press.

Large-scale production and applications of plastics increase their possibility of entering the environment. Previous environmental impact studies typically focused on the toxicity, behavior and fate; limited attention was paid on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. With the increase of plastic waste, the threat of plastic pollution to the earth's climate has been gradually taken seriously. Evidence showed that greenhouse gas emissions occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, including extraction and transportation of plastic raw materials, plastic manufacturing, waste treatment and entering the environment. The oil and gas industries used to make plastics are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions (from the extraction of raw materials to the manufacture of plastics). Emissions of greenhouse gases during manufacture are mainly controlled by the production facilities themselves, usually depending on the efficiency, configuration and service life of equipment. Additionally, there are some unintended impacts, including transport requirements, pipeline leakage, land use, as well as impeding forests as natural carbons sinks. Recycling of plastic waste energy seems to be a good way to deal with waste plastics, but this process will release a lot of greenhouse gases. With this energy conversion occurring, the incineration of plastic packing waste will become one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, plastics released into the environment also slowly release greenhouse gases, and the presence of (micro)plastics in the ocean will seriously interfere with the carbon fixation capacity of the ocean. In its current form, greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics will reach 1.34 gigatons per year by 2030 and 2.8 gigatons per year by 2050. This will seriously consume the global remaining carbon budgets, thereby threatening the ability of the global community to keep global temperatures rising by below 1.5 °C even 2 °C by 2100. In order to achieve this goal, the total global greenhouse gas emissions must be kept within the remaining carbon budget of 420–570 gigatons. The accumulative greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics may exceed 56 gigatons by 2050 (approximately accounting for 10%–13% of the total remaining carbon budget). As the plastic industry plans to expand production on a large scale, the problem will worsen further. The World Economic Forum forecasted that by 2030, the production and use of plastics will grow at an annual rate of 3.8%, and this growth rate will fall to 3.5% per year from 2030 to 2050. However, there are significant challenges and uncertainties in this estimation, and challenge and uncertainty factors come from all aspects. Recently, several organizations and researchers have started to discern the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and plastic industrials, but relevant research on these impacts is still in its infancy. Consequently, the contribution of plastic pollution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change should be given immediate attention and it needs to further explore the impact of plastic pollution on greenhouse gas emission and climate change. The implementation of measures to solve or alleviate the (micro)plastic crisis was critical necessary and proposed: (1) production control of global plastics; (2) improving the treatment and disposal of plastic waste; and (3) assessment of the impact of global environmental (micro)plastics on climate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"", ""It's a creative approach to reuse recycled plastic in the building sector rather than landfilling it. Nevertheless, most concrete characteristics have been impacted by the use of recycled plastic aggregates (RPA). Several methods, including treating the RPAs' surface, were used in earlier studies to reduce the harmful impact of the RPAs on the performance of the concrete. Disposing of waste materials on land is a significant environmental risk, which can be mitigated by significantly stepping up recycling initiatives. Plastic pollution of rivers, land, and oceans is a significant problem for the sustainability of the ecosystem due to the availability of waste plastic. Because plastic production is growing exponentially and plastic trash is increasing, scientists and researchers are looking for innovative and sustainable solutions to recycle or reuse plastic waste to reduce its negative environmental effects. Waste plastic has great potential in several sectors, including fabric, apparel, building materials, household goods, and fuel conversion. Adding plastic waste resulting from human waste from various applications into the concrete manufacturing process represents a viable approach and implementation in the future. This process is essential for saving the environment from plastic waste and its dangerous effects. Many studies focus on introducing plastic waste into the concrete-making process as an alternative to construction aggregate in general. Summaries, comparisons, and data analysis from other studies on using plastic waste in concrete are provided in this study. The primary goals of this review study are to lessen plastic waste and assess the mechanical qualities of concrete after adding plastic trash to it. Mechanical qualities, particularly compressive, tensile, and flexural strength, were the subject of numerous tests. This study introduces an innovative method of using recycled plastic in the construction industry instead of disposing it in landfills. Utilizing recycled plastic aggregates (RPAs) substantially influences many properties of concrete. Prior research has utilized several techniques, such as surface treatment of RPAs, to alleviate the adverse impact on the performance of concrete. Disposing of waste materials in landfills is a substantial environmental hazard, which may be reduced by improving recycling initiatives. The escalating production and buildup of plastic trash pose a significant danger to the sustainability of ecosystems in rivers, land, and seas, leading to plastic pollution. Scientists and researchers are actively exploring novel and environmentally friendly methods to recycle or repurpose plastic garbage to minimize its negative environmental effects. Waste plastic has significant potential in several industries, such as textiles, clothing, construction materials, home products, and fuel production. Incorporating plastic trash from many origins into the concrete production procedure is a feasible and sustainable strategy crucial for alleviating the detrimental impact of plastic waste on the environment. This analysis specifically examines the integration of plastic trash into manufacturing concrete, serving as a substitute for conventional building aggregates. This document presents summaries, comparisons, and data analyses derived from research exploring the utilization of plastic waste in concrete. The main objectives are to minimize plastic waste and evaluate the mechanical characteristics of concrete using plastic waste. Many tests were carried out to assess the mechanical characteristics, namely the compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths. For example, adding 10% RPAs led to a 15% decrease in compressive strength, whereas RPAs that underwent surface treatment minimized this effect to just 5%. The tensile strength exhibited a 12% decline when subjected to a 15% concentration of RPAs, while the flexural strength obtained an 18% reduction when exposed to a 20% concentration of RPAs. The findings underscore the possibilities and difficulties of using recycled plastic in concrete applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.""]"

Of special concern are the effects of micro- and nano-sized plastics. A key issue in understanding the fate and potential effects of micro- and nano-sized plastics is their dynamic nature, as the size, shape, and charge of the particles change over time. Moreover, due to various biological processes, such as the aggregation of organic material and/or bacteria (""biofouling""), the density of plastic particles that settle in the sediments of aquatic ecosystems may be several orders of magnitudes higher than that in the surrounding waters. Consequently, the risk posed by plastic pollution to benthic fauna is considerably high. Nonetheless, the vast majority of studies examining the effects of microplastics have focused on pelagic organisms so far. We therefore conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine the impact of micro- and nano-sized plastics on benthic invertebrates, including the physical and chemical effects of leaching and the interactions of plastic particles with contaminants. Overall, 330 papers were reviewed for their fulfillment of different criteria (e.g., test species, plastic material, particle shape, particle size, exposure concentration, exposure route, assay type, assay duration), with 49 publications finally included in our survey. A comprehensive gap-analysis on the effects of plastic particles on benthic invertebrates revealed a wide variety of effects triggered by micro- and/or nano-sized plastics but also distinct differences regarding the plastic materials tested, the size fractions applied, the shape of the respective particles, and the exposure routes tested. Our review concludes with a discussion of the important research gaps concerning freshwater ecosystems and recommendations for future areas of research. © 2019 Haegerbaeumer, Mueller, Fueser and Traunspurger.', ""Plastic's widespread use in everyday life has resulted in massive amounts of plastic waste, posing a significant environmental burden. Microplastics have been widely dispersed throughout various ecosystems, and their microplastics pollution is already prevalent in marine ecosystems, contributing to an increase in awareness over the last few decades. More than 50% of all plastic pollution is disposed in landfills, with incineration accounting for almost one-fifth of all waste management. Nearly one-tenth of plastic debris is reused, with the remainder, approximately one-fifth of all improperly handled plastic waste, ending up in land and marine environments. A number of studies are being conducted to determine the source of microplastics along with their negative impact on marine organisms and, ultimately, human health. Hence, we compiled and scientifically discussed in this review the source, accumulation, and detrimental effects of microplastics on the marine ecosystem. Furthermore, the progress in bioremediation options for microplastics remediation in marine aquatic ecosystems was thoroughly examined. It was discovered that growing scientific data reveals the existence of various forms of microplastics in food, and the aquatic ecosystem, as well as ultimately reaching humans. This review provides the collective information about the source and accumulation of microplastics as well as their impacts on aquatic organisms. Furthermore, in this review limitation in the microplastic detection and also research gaps in the remediation techniques were discussed. Furthermore, precise investigational research is required to support the negative effects of microplastics particles on human health. To address the microplastics pollution issues in marine environment, a few steps as well as attempts need to be taken. The knowledge gained from this review will serve as a foundation for future marine microplastics research and management techniques. © 2023 The Institution of Chemical Engineers"", 'Plastic pollution is a widespread and significant environmental problem. Of the 359 million tonnes of plastic produced in 2018, 5.5-14.5 million tonnes entered the ocean; it is unknown how long plastic remains in the environment (Wayman & Niemann, 2021). Understanding the transport and fate of plastic particles in the environment is critical for assessing impacts and mitigation approaches. However, the definition of a ""microplastic""is nebulous; the most common definition is <5mm (Arthur et al. 2009). Microparticles observed in this paper are less than 1 mm, in accordance with the definition and categorization framework from Hartmann et al. (2019). Environmental plastic particles may be further divided into ""primary""and ""secondary"". ""Primary""refers to plastic particles that are purposefully manufactured in the form of small particles (e.g. microbeads from cosmetics) and ""secondary""being produced from the breakdown of larger plastics. It is estimated 70-80% of microplastics released into the environment are secondary while 15-31% are primary microplastics (Mariano et al., 2021). Common plastic polymers include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyurethane, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).Identification of MPs consists of two goals: physical characterization of observed particles and chemical characterization of the observed particles (Mariano et al., 2021). Physical characterization is typically achieved with microscopal techniques (e.g., stereo-, fluorescence, atomic force, transmission electron, scanning electron), which can rapidly identify the shape, size, and color of the particles. Some microscope techniques (e.g., SEM) have analytical potential by identifying both the physical and chemical properties of plastic polymers (Mariano et al., 2021). Most of these techniques involve complex equipment that is unsuitable for use in the field. Portable microscopes can visually identify MPs in situ but lack the ability to chemically identify the observed particles. Chemical characterization can be achieved with spectroscopy techniques (e.g., Fourier-Transform Infrared, Raman, Thermal Analysis); however, traditional spectrometers are expensive and complex machines and are unsuitable for in-situ use. Portable spectrometers are available, but these devices are costly and must be paired with in-situ microscopy techniques to detect MPs. An efficient in-situ MP detection method ought to be portable, economical, able to determine MPs visually and chemically, and ideally, able to classify found MPs.A novel solution for in-situ MP detection, Nile Red (9-diethylamino-5-benzo[a]phenoxazinone; NR) offers a rapid and low-cost approach to identify MPs both visually and chemically. Nile Red is a lipophilic stain that preferentially bonds to plastic polymers and renders them fluorescent when illuminated with blue light. Organic detritus such as seaweed, wood, feathers, and various mollusk shells stain weakly or not at all (Maes et al., 2017). In-situ detection of stained MPs can be accomplished with photography and an appropriate light filter setup. Microplastic detection to date has involved sample preparation, typically including filtering and drying the sample. To detect MPs in situ (i.e., an aqueous sample), Nile Red is applied to environmental seawater samples, and fluorescent particles are identified and extracted for closer analysis. NR solutions of acetone, acetone:n-hexane, and methanol were tested for their interactions with water. Nile Red is a practical solution for the in-situ detection of microplastics for its relative ease of use and ability to identify plastic polymers visually and chemically. Nile Red staining can be a valuable tool for rapid screening to complement other identification/characterization methods. © 2023 IEEE.']"

Debris items were primarily plastic and metal regardless of trawl location. Plastic bait jars, fishing line, and crab pots were the most common fishery-related debris items and were encountered in large amounts in inlets (20-25 items km-2), but were less abundant outside of inlets (4.5-11 items km-2). Overall density of debris was also significantly greater in inlets than outside of inlets. Plastic debris densities in inlets ranged 22-31.5 items km-2, 7.8-18.8 items km-2 outside of inlets. Trawls in inlets contained almost as much metal debris as plastic debris. Density of metal debris ranged from 21.2 to 23.7 items km-2 in inlets, a maximum of 2.7 items km-2 outside of inlets. Inlets around the town of Kodiak had the highest densities of fishery-related and total benthic debris. Differences in benthic debris density between inlets and outside of inlets and differences by area may be due to differences in fishing activity and water circulation patterns. At the current reduced levels of fishing activity, however, yearly monitoring of benthic debris appears unnecessary. Copyright (C) 1999.', 'We report on three decades of repeat surveys of beached marine debris at two locations in the Scotia Sea, in the Southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Between October 1989 and March 2019 10,112 items of beached debris were recovered from Main Bay, Bird Island, South Georgia in the northern Scotia Sea. The total mass of items (data from 1996 onwards) was 101 kg. Plastic was the most commonly recovered item (97.5% by number; 89% by mass) with the remainder made up of fabric, glass, metal, paper and rubber. Mean mass per item was 0.01 kg and the rate of accumulation was 100 items km−1 month−1. Analyses showed an increase in the number of debris items recovered (5.7 per year) but a decline in mean mass per item, suggesting a trend towards more, smaller items of debris at Bird Island. At Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, located in the southern Scotia Sea and within the Antarctic Treaty area, debris items were collected from three beaches, during the austral summer only, between 1991 and 2019. In total 1304 items with a mass of 268 kg were recovered. Plastic items contributed 84% by number and 80% by mass, with the remainder made up of metal (6% by number; 14% by mass), rubber (4% by number; 3% by mass), fabric, glass and paper (<1% by number; 3% by mass). Mean mass per item was 0.2 kg and rate of accumulation was 3 items km−1 month−1. Accumulation rates were an order of magnitude higher on the western (windward) side of the island (13–17 items km−1 month−1) than the eastern side (1.5 items km−1 month−1). Analyses showed a slight decline in number and slight increase in mean mass of debris items over time at Signy Island. This study highlights the prevalence of anthropogenic marine debris (particularly plastic) in the Southern Ocean. It shows the importance of long-term monitoring efforts in attempting to catalogue marine debris and identify trends, and serves warning of the urgent need for a wider understanding of the extent of marine debris across the whole of the Southern Ocean. © 2020', 'The distribution and abundance of large marine debris were investigated on continental shelves and slopes along European Seas, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Bay of Biscay and different areas in the north-western basin of the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea. On the basis of 27 oceanographic cruises undertaken between November 1992 and August 1998, different types of debris were enumerated, particularly pieces of plastic, plastic and glass bottles, metallic objects, glass, and diverse materials including fishing gear. The results showed considerable geographical variation in concentrations, which ranged from 0 to 101000 pieces of debris per km2. In most stations sampled, plastic (mainly bags and bottles) accounted for a very high percentage (more than 70%) of total number of debris, and accumulation of specific debris, such as fishing gear, was also common. In some areas, only small amounts of debris were collected on the continental shelf, mostly in canyons descending from the continental slope and in the bathyal plain where high amounts were found down to more than 500 m. Dives using the manned submersibles Cyana and Nautile between 50 and 2700 m allowed accumulation areas to be detected on the sea floor. Analysis of these results revealed the influence of geomorphologic factors, local anthropic activities and river inputs. Temporal trends indicated a stable situation in the Gulf of Lion and seasonal variations in the northern part of the Bay of Biscay. Accumulation areas were detected 200 km west of Denmark, in the southern part of the Celtic Sea and along the south-east coast of France. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.']"

Since 2005, the International Pellet Watch used plastic pellets to monitor hydrophobic organic contaminants in marine environments. We examined the spatial distribution and sources of 16 PAHs and eight OCPs on microplastics (pellets, fragments, and foam) collected from eastern Guangdong beaches with the goal of evaluating the feasibility of exclusively using pellets in global monitoring of hydrophobic organic contaminants. The ∑PAH and ∑OCP concentrations ranged from 11.2 to 7710 ng g−1 and 2.2–1970 ng g−1, respectively. Although inter-site and regional differences were insignificant in fragments and foam, regional differences were observed in ∑OCP concentrations on pellets samples collected at the estuary mouth and the distributary (p < 0.05). No regional difference in ∑PAH concentration on microplastics was observed, except between fragments from the remote beach and those from the distributary (p = 0.015) and the estuary mouth (p = 0.015). The compositional profiles of PAHs revealed that PAHs with 2–4 rings were more dominant than those with >4 rings. Considering low molecular weight PAHs are less hydrophobic and more toxic; the results suggest low molecular weight PAHs may pose a significant risk to marine organisms. This study shows that the International Pellet Watch could offer critical data on source and transport of microplastic-associated OCPs but may overlook critical vehicles of PAHs in coastal environments such as foam. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.', 'Halogenated organic contaminants, such as chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl/Br-PAHs), are some of the most important emerging environmental pollutants. However, empirical data on Cl/Br-PAHs in estuarine and marine ecosystems are limited, rendering assessments of Cl/Br-PAH contamination in estuarine and offshore environments uncertain. Here the occurrence, sources, and ecological risks of 7 Cl-PAHs and 18 Br-PAHs were determined in surface sediments of the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), a highly urbanized and industrialized area, and its adjacent marine area. The concentrations of Cl-PAHs ranged from 4.50 to 18.38 ng g−1 (average 7.19 ng g−1), while those of Br-PAHs ranged from 4.80 to 61.18 ng g−1 (average 14.11 ng g−1). The dominant Cl-PAH and Br-PAH in surface sediment were 9-chlorofluorene (17.79%) and 9-bromofluorene (58.49%), respectively. The distributions and compositions of Cl/Br-PAHs in the surface sediments varied considerably due to complex hydrodynamic and depositional conditions in the YRE and its adjacent marine area, as well as differences in physicochemical properties of different Cl/Br-PAHs. Positive matrix factorization revealed that the primary sources of Cl/Br-PAHs in the study area were e-waste dismantling (33.6%), waste incineration (23.2%), and metal smelting (11.0%). According to the risk quotient, the Cl/Br-PAHs in sediments posed no toxic risk to aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.', ""Currently, although the cumulative effects of microplastics (MPs) and organic pollutants (OPs) in the environment and within organisms are being investigated, whether and how MPs participate in bioaccumulation of OPs based on a carrier effect is still unclear. In the present study, water and aquatic organisms were collected from the Pearl River. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and MPs were separated by solid phase extraction and were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Higher PAH concentrations at the river outlet and higher MPs abundance in the inner river were observed, indicating a mismatched distribution between PAHs and MPs. No correlation between MP abundance and PAH concentration in fishes was detected, implying that MPs exerted limited influence on PAH concentrations. Interestingly, bioconcentration factors of one major low-ring PAH (phenanthrene) in fishes showed a significant correlation with MPs abundance, implying that although MPs did not affect the variation in PAH concentrations, they potentially participated in selective bioaccumulation of PAHs. Moreover, significant correlations between MPs abundance and PAHs in fishes with different feeding and living habits were found, indicating that MPs' participation in PAH bioaccumulation was dependent on fish biology and life history. Furthermore, the health risk posed by PAHs in fishes at the river outlet surpassed the line of potential high risk, while the ecological risk posed by MPs at the inner river was in the danger category, indicating the ecological risks posed by PAHs and MPs are uneven along the Pearl River. These findings deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanism of MPs participating in selective bioaccumulation of low-ring PAHs in fishes based on fish biology and point out the present risks posed by these two pollutants in the Pearl River and its estuary, which contribute to aquatic environmental protection and fishery production in this region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.""]"
