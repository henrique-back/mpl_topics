Plastic pieces in smaller size scales, microplastics (particles <5mm), have reached high densities (e.g., 100000 items per m<sup>3</sup>) in waters and sediments, and are interacting with organisms and the environment in a variety of ways. Early investigations of freshwater systems suggest microplastic presence and interactions are equally as far reaching as are being observed in marine systems. Microplastics are being detected in freshwaters of Europe, North America, and Asia, and the first organismal studies are finding that freshwater fauna across a range of feeding guilds ingest microplastics.Drawing from the marine literature and these initial freshwater studies, we review the issue of microplastics in freshwater systems to summarise current understanding, identify knowledge gaps and suggest future research priorities. Evidence suggests that freshwater systems may share similarities to marine systems in the types of forces that transport microplastics (e.g. surface currents); the prevalence of microplastics (e.g. numerically abundant and ubiquitous); the approaches used for detection, identification and quantification (e.g. density separation, filtration, sieving and infrared spectroscopy); and the potential impacts (e.g. physical damage to organisms that ingest them, chemical transfer of toxicants). Differences between freshwater and marine systems include the closer proximity to point sources in freshwaters, the typically smaller sizes of freshwater systems, and spatial and temporal differences in the mixing/transport of particles by physical forces. These differences between marine and freshwater systems may lead to differences in the type of microplastics present. For example, rivers may show a predictable pattern in microplastic characteristics (size, shape, relative abundance) based on waste sources (e.g. household vs. industrial) adjacent to the river, and distance downstream from a point source.Given that the study of microplastics in freshwaters has only arisen in the last few years, we are still limited in our understanding of 1) their presence and distribution in the environment; 2) their transport pathways and factors that affect distributions; 3) methods for their accurate detection and quantification; 4) the extent and relevance of their impacts on aquatic life. We also do not know how microplastics might transfer from freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems, and we do not know if and how they may affect human health. This is concerning because human populations have a high dependency on freshwaters for drinking water and for food resources. Increasing the level of understanding in these areas is essential if we are to develop appropriate policy and management tools to address this emerging issue.', '【Objective】Microplastics contamination is an aggravating environmental problem threatening the marine ecosystem, where it has spread globally even to the remotest habitats. Extremely small in particle size (<5 mm), microplastics have been found in high density in waters and sediments, and are interacting with organisms and the environment in a variety of ways. Microplastics in the environment have the characteristics of being extremely small in particle size, hydrophobic, and capable of carrying persistent organic pollutants (pops). A wide range of marine organisms have been found to have ingested microplastics by mistake as food, thus leading to loss of nutritional value of diet, physical damage and exposure to pathogens. In addition, microplastics are ready to adsorb toxic hydrophobic organic contaminants, which arouses the question of what risk of chemical exposure aquatic biota faces from microplastic-associated contaminants. Moreover, the presence of marine microplastics in seafood could pose a threat to food safety for mankind. 【Method】The Nanji National Nature Reserve, and the estuaries of the northern branch, the mid branch as well as the southern branch of the Ganjiang River were selected as objects of this study. Sediment samples were collected from 12 sampling sites for isolation of microplastics therein by flotation separation, and exploration of distribution and composition of the microplastics in the sediment. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. 【Result】Results show that in terms of microplastics abundance in the sediment, the four regions appeared to follow an order of the mid branch > the southern branch > Nanji > the northern branch, varying in the range of 1 452±221 ind·kg-1, 1 285±69 ind·kg-1, 102±65 ind·kg-1 and 11±6 ind·kg-1, respectively. Microplastics abundance in the sediment varied with water regime of the regions, exhibiting an order of dry season > normal season > rainy season. The microplastics in the sediment were dominated with foam, and then fiber in of Naji, mainly with fibre in the northern branch, and mainly with fragments in the middle and southern branches, accounting for more than half of the total amount of microplastics. Microplastics in the sediment were mostly 2~3 mm in particle size, and some 3~4 mm in Nanji and mostly < 1 mm in the branches, which making up more than half of the total microplastics. The microplastics in the Ganjiang River varied in particle size and displayed an order of <1 mm > 1~2 mm > 2~3 mm > 3~4 mm > 4~5 mm in particle size composition. The larger in particle size, the smaller in proportion. The microplastics differed greatly with type in surface morphology and roughness. Fragment microplastics were various in color and shape, with rough surface and obvious signs of wear. Fiber microplastics were smooth, linear and mostly blue in surface. Foaming microplastics were mostly white, light in texture and various in shape. Film microplastics were smooth, soft and irregular. There was great variability in composition of microplastics with type. The microplastics in the Ganjiang River were composed mainly of polyethylene and polypropylene. 【Conclusion】 Microplastics abundance is closely related to human activities, and the microplastics in the Ganjiang come mainly from the decomposition of daily plastics supplies and packaging, such as fertilizer and cement bags. Overall, all the findings in tthis study provide strong evidence of the high levels of microplastics pollution in the Poyang Lake, and suggest that more attention should be paid to monitoring microplastics pollution of the Poyang Lake.', 'Microplastics are a widespread environmental contaminant that raises serious concern for aquatic organisms. Hence, the present study was conducted to investigate the spatial and seasonal variation of microplastics, their characteristics, polymer types and the risk assessment caused by the microplastics in six sampling sites along the Thoothukudi region. The average microplastic abundance ranged from 32 ± 26 to 232 ± 229 items/kg and 54 ± 41 to 619 ± 377 items/l in sediment and surface water, respectively, and they exhibited a significant spatial difference among the sampling sites. The microplastic abundance also showed a significant difference among the seasons with the monsoon significantly recording the highest mean microplastic abundance in sediment (160 ± 130 items/kg) and surface water (454 ± 374 items/l). In sediment and surface water, fragment (sediment: 52.72%, surface water: 40.89%), 0.5–1\xa0mm (sediment: 43.96%, surface water: 31.11%) and blue-coloured (sediment: 52.33%, surface water: 41.85%) microplastics were dominant with no significant difference both spatially and seasonally. Polyethylene, the dominant polymer, was observed in both the sediment and surface water, accounting for about 47.58% and 49.83%, respectively, and it showed no significant difference among the selected sites. This signifies that they are homogenously distributed along the coast and further suggests that these particles persisted in the sediment and surface water for a longer period of time. The results of the polymer hazard index show that the sediment (PHI = 1181.63) and surface water (PHI = 1018.66) were severely contaminated (hazard level V) with microplastic polymers such as PE, PP, PS, PET and PA. It was also found that the degree of the microplastic contamination in sediment (PLI = 3.57) and surface water (PLI = 3.84) was lower (hazard level I). The overall risk index (RI) for sediment (253.48) and surface water (444.74) falls under the higher risk category. From the correlation analysis, a significantly positive relationship was observed between microplastics in sediment and surface water based on each classification (abundance, shape, size, colour and polymer). This suggests that microplastics rejoin the water column from the sediment through resuspension, which occurs due to the circulation, tides and sedimentation rate. This might be the reason for the higher microplastic abundance in the surface water than in the sediment. As a result, proper management measures to reduce plastic waste disposal in the marine environment should be implemented to lessen the effects of microplastics on marine biota and on public health.']"

In Nigeria, the growing production of single-use plastics and the uncontrolled release of plastic debris onto the land and marine habitats are facilitating widespread plastic pollution. In this chapter, we critically review and summarize the sources, causes, and consequences of plastic pollution in Nigeria and suggest some priorities for future policy and research. Over 60 million plastic sachet water bags are consumed and disposed of daily in Nigeria, and single-use plastic shopping bags and takeaway packs are ubiquitous. These plastic sachets, single-carrier bags, and other disposable plastic products end up on the land and in the marine environment because of indiscriminate disposal and the popular social practice of dumping waste on the roadside, under bridges, and in drainage channels (gutters) during periods of rainfall. Therefore, some litter the streets, while others end up in the marine ecosystem. Nigeria is widely reported as having released up to 0.34 million tonnes of plastic debris into the ocean in 2010 and was ranked the ninth country in the world for pollution of marine environments. Waste management habits/behavior facilitate indiscriminate disposal of plastic waste, which in turn exacerbates plastic pollution in Nigeria. A lack of awareness of the environmental and potential health risks of plastic pollution, the poor resourcing of waste management and recycling infrastructure, an unskilled/inadequate waste collection workforce, and untimely litter collection potentially exacerbate the scale of the problem. There is a need to change the political and social will in Nigeria, and regulation of single-use shopping bags through taxes/levies and refillable sachet water bags could be introduced. Media programs and special education, focused on societal values and an awareness/knowledge of the causes of plastic pollution, should be designed. Investing in waste collection and recycling infrastructure should be prioritized. Interdisciplinary research to determine the extent to which macro- and micro/nanoplastics pollutions are present in Nigerian land and marine environments should be conducted to facilitate health and environmental decision-making and policies.', ""Plastic use and production have dramatically increased globally over the past 65 years with the improvement of life quality by the daily use of plastic products. Still, around 50% of the plastic produced is disposable products that generate substantial waste. Several reports pointed out the adverse effects of plastic litter in coastal environments in recent years, emphasizing single-use plastics (SUP). In this manner, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) coastal environments are highly vulnerable due to wastewater treatment facilities scarcity and poor plastic waste management strategies. Since COVID-19 pandemic, the single-use plastic waste/person rate is expected to rise due to the use of personal protective equipment and SUP as health care measures. Based on literature research and the review of plastic waste regulations, this paper will assess the main COVID-19 plastic pollution threats and LAC beaches' regulations to suggest possible measures to abate this problem. The main findings suggest that unifying the ongoing fragmented and overlapped policies is key to abate plastic pollution, including plastic industry regulations and circular economies. In addition, increasing public risk perception about plastic pollution is critical to reducing plastic waste generation. Research advances in the adverse effects of plastic debris could improve the public's perception of plastic pollution risk, pushing forward global marine plastic governance."", 'Marine litter is a worldwide problem. It impacts negatively marine environment, organisms, human health and coastal communities. In this research, abundance, composition and sources of marine litter (macro-debris > 2.5\xa0cm) and beach cleanliness were assessed for three beaches in the central Croatian Adriatic Sea. Mean abundance for the studied region was 3.35\xa0items/m2 and the highest recorded CCI value was 150. Most of the collected litter was made of artificial polymer material (93.86%), and main sources of litter were shoreline activities representing (31.68% of the total sample) and fishing and aquaculture representing (12.66% of the total sample). Land-based and sea-based sources accounted for 32.76% and 15.16%, respectively. Results from the present study provide another evidence of marine litter problem and high presence of plastic items in the marine environment of the Adriatic Sea. Presence of litter from different countries shows the internationality of marine litter problem which can only be solved by international collaborations and partnerships as well as by taking individual responsibility of all. Presence of the short-life single-use plastic items and the problems associated with them have been recognized in this study as most of the items collected were single-use items. High abundance of these items indicates not only their large use in everyday life, but also the lack of awareness of the general public about the environmental problem they cause. Moreover, the results obtained in this research imply the need for better waste management systems.']"
2,1,811,1_microbial_plastic_bacterial_plastics,1: Microbial Communities on Marine Plastic Debris,"['microbial', 'plastic', 'bacterial', 'plastics', 'bacteria', 'marine', 'communities', 'degradation', 'plastisphere', 'microplastics']","['Since the middle of the 20th century, plastics have been incorporated into our everyday lives at an exponential rate. In recent years, the negative impacts of plastics, especially as environmental pollutants, have become evident. Marine plastic debris represents a relatively new and increasingly abundant substrate for colonization by microbial organisms, although the full functional potential of these organisms is yet to be uncovered. In the present study, we investigated plastic type and incubation location as drivers of marine bacterial community structure development on plastics, i.e., the Plastisphere, via 16S rRNA amplicon analysis. Four distinct plastic types: highdensity polyethylene (HDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyamide (PA), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and glass-slide controls were incubated for five weeks in the coastal waters of four different biogeographic locations (Cape Verde, Chile, Japan, South Africa) during July and August of 2019. The primary driver of the coastal Plastisphere composition was identified as incubation location, i.e., biogeography, while substrate type did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. The bacterial communities were consistently dominated by the classes Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia, irrespective of sampling location or substrate type, however a core bacterial Plastisphere community was not observable at lower taxonomic levels. Overall, this study sheds light on the question of whether bacterial communities on plastic debris are shaped by the physicochemical properties of the substrate they grow on or by the marine environment in which the plastics are immersed. This study enhances the current understanding of biogeographic variability in the Plastisphere by including biofilms from plastics incubated in the previously uncharted Southern Hemisphere.', 'Marine plastic debris has become a significant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide. Little is known, however, about its influence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the “great Pacific garbage patch.” The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2 to 5 mm and 5 mm) ranged from 0.35 to 3.7 particles m3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Pacific Ocean. Net community oxygen production (NCP gross primary production community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas NCP in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from the surrounding picoplankton and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with significantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes, and nifH genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions, and nitrogen fixation. In aggregate, our findings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways, and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from those of free-living planktonic microbial communities. IMPORTANCE Marine plastic debris is a growing concern that has captured the general public’s attention. While the negative impacts of plastic debris on oceanic macrobiota, including mammals and birds, are well documented, little is known about its influence on smaller marine residents, including microbes that have key roles in ocean biogeochemistry. Our work provides a new perspective on microbial communities inhabiting microplastics that includes its effect on microbial biogeochemical activities and a description of the cross-domain communities inhabiting plastic particles. This study is among the first molecular ecology, plastic debris biota surveys in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. It has identified fundamental differences in the functional potential and taxonomic composition of plastic-associated microbes versus planktonic microbes found in the surrounding open-ocean habitat.', 'Microplastics have emerged as new pollutants in oceans. Nevertheless, information of the long-term variations in the composition of plastic-associated microbial communities in coastal waters remains limited. This study applied high-throughput sequencing to investigate the successional stages of microbial communities attached to polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics exposed for one year in the coastal seawater of China. The composition of plastisphere microbial communities varied remarkably across geographical locations and exposure times. The dominant bacteria in the plastisphere were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria class, particularly Rhodobacteraceae, followed by the Gammaproteobacteria class. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the microplastics showed signs of degradation. Microbial communities showed adaptations to plastisphere including more diverse microbial community and greater “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism” in metabolic pathway analysis. The findings elucidate the long-term changes in the community composition of microorganisms that colonize microplastics and expand the understanding of plastisphere microbial communities present in the marine environment.']"

They are primarily derived from larger pieces of plastic debris that degrade into smaller pieces. The current study identified, characterized, and quantified MPs in Chennai coast coastal aquifers, seawater, and foreshore sediments. The spatial distribution and polymer composition of MP particles were studied to identify and evaluate their abundance and characteristics (composite, size, color, and shape of MPs). The foreshore and river mouth sediment samples were found to be contaminated by MPs with a total of 263 particles in 12 samples collected from different locations (average of 22 particles 5 g−1 of dry sediment (d.s.)). The surface water and groundwater samples were also contaminated by MPs with a total of 315 particles in 25 samples collected from different locations (average of 13 particles/L). Size of majorities of MPs ranged from 1 mm to 300 μm. The study also confirmed the presence of MPs in sediments and water samples collected from the study area using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR results revealed that nylon, polyvinylchloride, and polyethylene terephthalate were the predominant types of MPs. The spatial variation map showed that high concentration of MPs was observed on tourist beaches. Remediation technologies are highly effective in eliminating and preventing MPs pollution in our environment. The existence of MPs in water samples suggests that it is essential to take preventive steps to avoid MPs causing health issues like neurotoxicity, Alzheimer, and cancer.', 'Microplastic particles with particle sizes of less than 5 mm are of increasing concern. In this study, microplastics were sampled from the sediments of the Yellow River. The microplastic particles were separated from the sediments using density flotation separation methods, and the abundance, type, color, and particle size distribution of microplastics were measured. Meanwhile, composition characteristics and surface topography features were studied using Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).The results showed that microplastic abundance in the sediments was in the range of 15-615 items•kg-1, and the average abundance of microplastics in the downstream sediments was higher than that in the middle and upstream sediments.Four types of microplastics were identified in the sediments, including fragments, foams, thin films, and fibers. Of the particles analyzed, 43.35% were fragments, and 34.08% were foam, while the films and fiber microplastics accounted for 20.56% of the plastics. The FTIR analysis demonstrated that the major components of fragments, films, foams, and fibers were identified as oxidized polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene.The color of microplastics was divided into transparent, white, color, and black.The proportions of plastic that were transparent and white were 43.28% and 34.55%, respectively.The measurement of the particle size of the microplastics indicated that the particle sizes mainly ranged from 1-4 mm, accounting for 64.8%, and the proportion of microplastics<1 mm was 16.62%. The SEM-EDS results showed different aging degree of the microplastics with the characteristics of rough surface, many pores, and obvious cracks.', ""Research on microplastic (MP) pollution in the marine environment has received widespread attention in recent years. To assess the degree of MP contamination in the intertidal zone of China, the abundance, shape, particle size and composition of MPs in sediment were investigated in this study. Sediment samples were collected from 13 stations along the coast of China. The density separation method was employed to isolate MPs from sediment and the polymer types of the MPs were determined by Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. Our study demonstrated that MP pollution was widespread in the 13 intertidal stations. The average abundance of MPs was 309 ± 81 items/kg dry weight. Fiber accounted for 71.5% of the isolated MPs, and the particles of less than 500 μm accounted for the highest proportion (35.0%). A total of 12 polymers were identified; the main types were rayon (RY), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE). The shape and chemical composition of the MPs from the intertidal sediments of South and North China were different. In South China, MP fragments were more extensive, and PP was a more important component. In contrast, the intertidal sediments of North China contained more MP fibers with the majority being RY, indicating that the major source of MPs in the intertidal zone of North China may be domestic sewage. Additionally, the abundance of MPs in the intertidal sediments of the Pearl River and Jiulong River estuaries was higher than at other sites. A Spearman's correlation analysis showed that there was no correlation between MP abundance and sediment grain size or organic matter content. Our study highlights the ubiquitous distribution of MPs in the sediment along the coast of China and provides valuable information for risk assessment and source control of MP pollution in China's intertidal zone. MP pollution level is relatively high in intertidal sediments of China with obviously different pollution characteristics between southern and northern areas.""]"
4,3,758,3_exposure_effects_ps_mps,3: Adverse Effects of Microplastic Exposure on Marine Organisms,"['exposure', 'effects', 'ps', 'mps', 'microplastics', 'exposed', 'toxicity', 'nps', 'concentrations', 'marine']","['Plastic pollution has been globally recognized as a critical issue for marine ecosystems and nanoplastics constitute one of the last unexplored areas to understand the magnitude of this threat. However, current difficulties in sampling and identifying nano-sized debris make hard to assess their occurrence in marine environment. Polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) are largely used as nanoplastics in ecotoxicological studies and although acute exposures have been already investigated, long-term toxicity on marine organisms is unknown. Our study aims at evaluating the effects of 40\xa0nm PS anionic carboxylated (PS-COOH) and 50\xa0nm cationic amino-modified (PS-NH2) NPs in two planktonic species, the green microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta and the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana, respectively prey and predator. PS NP behaviour in exposure media was determined through DLS, while their toxicity to microalgae and brine shrimps evaluated through 72\xa0h growth inhibition test and 14 d long-term toxicity test respectively. Moreover, the expression of target genes (i.e. clap and cstb), having a role in brine shrimp larval growth and molting, was measured in 48\xa0h brine shrimp larvae. A different behaviour of the two PS NPs in exposure media as well as diverse toxicity to the two planktonic species was observed. PS-COOH formed micro-scale aggregates (Z-Average\xa0>\xa01\xa0μm) and did not affect the growth of microalgae up to 50\xa0μg/ml or that of brine shrimps up to 10\xa0μg/ml. However, these negatively charged NPs were adsorbed on microalgae and accumulated (and excreted) in brine shrimps, suggesting a potential trophic transfer from prey to predator. On the opposite, PS-NH2-formed nano-scale aggregates (Z-Average\xa0<\xa0200\xa0nm), caused inhibition of algal growth (EC50\xa0=\xa012.97\xa0μg/ml) and mortality in brine shrimps at 14 d (LC50\xa0=\xa00.83\xa0μg/ml). Moreover, 1\xa0μg/ml PS-NH2 significantly induced clap and cstb genes, explaining the physiological alterations (e.g. increase in molting) previously observed in 48\xa0h larvae, but also suggesting an apoptotic pathway triggered by cathepsin L-like protease in brine shrimps upon PS-NH2 exposure. These findings provide a first insight into long-term toxicity of nanoplastics to marine plankton, underlining the role of the surface chemistry in determining the behaviour and effects of PS NPs, in terms of adsorption, growth inhibition, accumulation, gene modulation and mortality. The use of long-term end-point has been identified as valuable tool for assessing the impact of nanoplastics on marine planktonic species, being more predictable of real exposure scenarios for risk assessment purposes.', 'Micro/nano-plastics (M/NPs) are emerging contaminants in aquatic environment, however, little knowledge regarding the adverse effects of functionalized NPs has been documented so far. This study investigated the accumulation of different polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, i.e., plain PS, carboxyl-functional PS-COOH and amino-functional PS-NH2) at two particle sizes of 100 nm and 200 nm, and evaluated the impacts on oxidative stress, energy metabolism and mitochondrial pathway responses in intestine and respiratory tree of Apostichopus japonicus during the 20-d exposure experiment. The results showed that there were significant interactions of particle size and nanoplastic type on the accumulation of different PS-NPs. Exposure to NPs significantly increased the production of malondialdehyde, glutathione and reactive oxygen species, as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, resulting in various degrees of oxidative damage in sea cucumber. The significant decrease in adenosine triphosphate content and increases in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activities suggested that NPs impaired energy metabolism and modified their energy allocation. After 20-d exposure, the complex I, II and III activities in mitochondrial respiratory chain were significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, the Bax and Caspase-3 gene expression were significantly up-regulated, and Bacl-2 was down-regulated, indicating the toxicity on mitochondrial pathway of A. japonicus. The calculated IBR values elucidated the greater detriment to mitochondrial pathway than oxidative stress and energy metabolism. For 100 nm particle size, plain PS has stronger influence on all the biomarkers compared to PS-COOH/NH2, however, the opposite trends were observed in 200 nm PS-NPs. Furthermore, 100 nm PS-NPs were recognized to be more hazardous to sea cucumber than 200 nm microbeads. These findings provide new insights for understanding the differentiated toxic effects of functionalized NPs in marine invertebrates.', 'This study aimed to examine the impact of chronic (30 days) exposure to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) of different sizes (50 nm and 2 µm) and at different concentrations (0.5 μg/L and 100 mg/L) to marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Polystyrene microplastics affected survival rates in size- and concentration-dependent manners. The LC50s values of 50 nm and 2 µm PS-MPs were 0.10 mg/L and 3.92 mg/L, respectively. The developmental time was delayed by 50 nm PS-MPs, and Usp expression was downregulated. Reproduction was negatively affected by 2 µm PS-MPs even at environmentally relevant concentrations; however, the expression of Vtg was not altered. The production rates of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide also increased after exposure to PS-MPs; but this effect was independent of particle size. The expression levels of Cat and Tnf, genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation, respectively, were upregulated by exposure to PS-MPs, independently of particle size. Meanwhile, the level of oxidative stress in T. japonicus was not significantly affected by PS-MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations. This study suggests that nano-sized PS-MPs are not always more toxic than micro-sized PS-MPs, and that oxidative stress is a key factor in determining the toxic effect on T. japonicus at high concentrations.']"

This study investigated the possibility of MPs contamination in different marine fish species with substantial commercial value that was captured off the south coast of India, from Adyar and Ennore regions. Over the course of six months, from October 2019 to March 2020, 220 fish were examined. It was discovered that the gills and guts had accumulated more numbers of MPs (1115 MPs) of which 68% were fibres and fragments. The commercial fish samples contained an average of 3.2–7.6 MPs per fish. Greater MPs pollution is seen in the Ennore regions. The prevalence of MPs was observed in carnivorous and planktivorous fish collected from both the sites. Fish guts contained the most MPs, according to the data. Pelagic fish accounted for the least amount of MPs, followed by mid- and demersal fish. Four different types of polymers were also identified in the present study: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyamide. These results clearly showed the degree of microplastic contamination in fish tissues from the south Indian coastal regions of Adyar and Ennore. These results we hope will create a baseline data for MPs contamination in commercial fish species. The presence of MPs in the fish could have detrimental effects both on the environment and human health and thus comprehensive steps are required to prevent plastic pollution of the environment in south India's coastal region."", 'The researches on MPs in commercial marine fish are very limited although in marine environments microplastic (MPs) pollution is a global problem. In this study, the presence, composition, and characterization of MPs in different tissues (brain, gill, muscle, and gastrointestinal tract) of commercial fish species [red mullet (Mullus barbatus) and pontic shad (Alosa immaculata Bennett 1835)] from the Black Sea were investigated. M. barbatus (demersal) and A. immaculata (pelagic) fish were preferred in the selection of fish species in order to represent demersal and pelagic environments. After dissected the fish, MPs were obtained from the tissues by extraction using the flotation method; then the MPs were counted and categorized according to shape, size, and color. The composition of the MPs was determined via ATR–FTIR spectroscopy. In terms of microplastic abundance in fish tissues, the gastrointestinal tract (40.0%) ranked first in both fish species, while the lowest MPs density was determined in brain tissues (7.0%). After the gastrointestinal tissue, gills were identified as the second tissue with the highest MPs density. Regardless of fish species, MPs characterization was mainly fibrous (51.0%), black colored (49.0%), and 50–200\xa0µm in size (55.0%). Among the nine different polymers determined, polychloroprene (18.8%) and polyamide (15.0%) were found most frequently. This research provides data for tissue-based assessment of MPs in fish. The obtained data showed that MPs (one of the anthropogenic pollutants) are quite high in all tissues regardless of fish species. Moreover, it has emerged that these two fish species are suitable for monitoring microplastics in the study area.', 'Microplastic (MP) pollution has become an emerging global concern in marine environments, but research on the uptake of MPs by commercial marine fish is relatively sparse. In this study, 29 commercial fish species (n = 584) with different feeding habits and trophic levels were collected from 8 sites along the Bohai Sea for MP uptake analysis. Approximately 85.4% of the total fish among all species ingested MPs, and there was an average abundance of 2.14 items/individual or 0.043 items/g of wet weight. Compared with other studies, MP pollution in fishes from the Bohai Sea was relatively moderate. The MPs were predominantly fibrous in shape and were cellophane, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) in polymer composition. The highest abundance and polymer composition of MPs was observed in benthivores, suggesting that they might ingest these MPs from their food. The small fish Konosirus punctatus, which had a high level of MPs, may increase the risk of human exposure to the MPs when it is dried and consumed. Moreover, the spatial variation of MPs was determined in terms of abundance, shape composition, and major polymer types, but there was no marked relationship between MP abundance and the trophic levels of fish. Overall, this study provides a basis for the ecological risk assessment of MPs in fish and for a health risk assessment for human beings.']"

Gastrointestinal tracts were examined from 464 green turtles that stranded in Texas between 1987 and 2019, and 226 turtles ingested plastic (48.7%). This number doubled from 32.5% in 1987–1999 to 65.5% in 2019, but mass of ingested items was lowest in 2019. No turtles showed evidence of death directly related to plastic ingestion. Compared to other regions, plastic ingestion was low. Small turtles (<25 cm straight carapace length) ingested plastic more frequently and in greater amounts than larger turtles. Small turtles also ingested more hard plastic while larger turtles ingested more sheet-like and thread-like plastics, which may correspond to size-based habitat shifts. This is among the largest marine turtle ingestion studies to date and demonstrates an increasing prevalence of plastic ingestion.', 'Plastic pollution is a ubiquitous global environmental problem. Plastic ingestion by seabirds is an increasing issue even in remote areas, such as the Arctic, yet research and monitoring of plastic ingestion in Arctic seabird populations is limited, and there are large knowledge gaps for many geographic regions. There is currently no standard technique for monitoring plastic debris in the Arctic, making it difficult to compare studies and monitor global trends. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of plastic ingestion by seabirds in the Arctic. We analyzed 38 published records that report plastic ingestion by seabirds in the Arctic region. Of the 51 seabird species examined for plastic ingestion in the Arctic, over half have ingested plastic; however, the majority have a limited number of studies, small sample sizes, and (or) data are more than 15 years old. Additionally, the spatial distribution of plastic ingestion reports in the Arctic varies widely, with large knowledge gaps in the northernmost areas of most countries. This indicates that we lack recent information on plastic ingestion for most of the seabird species in the Arctic. Further, less than one-third of studies reference standardized methods from other regions, making it difficult to assess spatial and temporal trends. Long-term monitoring programs should be established in the Arctic to obtain an accurate assessment of plastic ingestion by seabirds in this region.', 'Plastic pollution has pervaded almost every facet of the biosphere, yet we lack an understanding of consumption risk by marine species at the global scale. To address this, we compile data from research documenting plastic debris ingestion by marine fish, totaling 171,774 individuals of 555 species. Overall, 386 marine fish species have ingested plastic debris including 210 species of commercial importance. However, 148 species studied had no records of plastic consumption, suggesting that while this evolutionary trap is widespread, it is not yet universal. Across all studies that accounted for microplastics, the incidence rate of plastic ingested by fish was 26%. Over the last decade this incidence has doubled, increasing by 2.4\xa0±\xa00.4%\xa0per year. This is driven both by increasing detection of smaller sized particles as a result of improved methodologies, as well as an increase in fish consuming plastic. Further, we investigated the role of geographic, ecological, and behavioral factors in the ingestion of plastic across species. These analyses revealed that the abundance of plastic in surface waters was positively correlated to plastic ingestion. Demersal species are more likely to ingest plastic in shallow waters; in contrast, pelagic species were most likely to consume plastic below the mixed layer. Mobile predatory species had the highest likelihood to ingest plastic; similarly, we found a positive relationship between trophic level and plastic ingestion. We also find evidence that surface ingestion-deep sea egestion of microplastics by mesopelagic myctophids is likely a key mechanism for the export of microplastics from the surface ocean to the seafloor, a sink for marine debris. These results elucidate the role of ecology and biogeography underlying plastic ingestion by marine fish and point toward species and regions in urgent need of study.']"
7,6,329,6_plastic_ocean_debris_surface,6: Floating Plastic Debris and Ocean Transport,"['plastic', 'ocean', 'debris', 'surface', 'model', 'marine', 'floating', 'plastics', 'plastic debris', 'transport']","['Despite an increasing research conducted on ocean plastic pollution over the last decade, there are still large knowledge gaps in our current understanding of how floating plastic debris accumulating in subtropical oceanic gyres may harm the surface-associated pelagic community known as neuston. Removing floating plastic debris from the surface ocean can minimize potentially adverse effects of plastic pollution on the neuston, as well as prevent the formation of large quantities of secondary micro- and nanoplastics. However, due to the scarcity of observational data from remote and difficult to access offshore waters, neuston dynamics in subtropical oceanic gyres and thus the potential impacts of plastic pollution as well as of cleanup activities on the neuston remain uncertain. Here, we provide rare observational data of the relative distribution of floating plastic debris (0.05–5 cm in size) and members of the neuston in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Our results reveal that the dominant neustonic species co-occurring with high concentrations of floating plastic debris in the North Pacific Garbage Patch (NPGP) such as Porpita porpita, Halobates spp., pteropods, isopods, heteropods, and crabs depict either a low atmospheric drag due to physical attributes or a potential plastic-associated fitness benefit such as increased surface area for oviposition and structure for habitat. We further observe relatively higher plastic to organism ratios inside the NPGP for most target species compared to waters outside the NPGP. The findings presented here provide a first observational baseline to develop ecological models that can help evaluate the long-term risks of plastic pollution and of offshore cleanup activities for neuston in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. We further suggest that offshore mitigation strategies aiming at removing floating plastic debris from the ocean surface need to evaluate both, the direct impact of neuston bycatch during plastic removal on neuston population dynamics, as well as the potential benefits of reducing the negative effects of plastic pollution on the neuston.', 'In our modern world, plastics are everywhere in the daily life and they are also the most abundant type of litter or discarded solid waste, in particular in the marine environment. The situation results in a persistent, ubiquitous presence of plastics in the world ocean. Consequently, plastics in their different forms represents the most pressing environmental issues on the oceans and, potentially, on the human health. However, the pathways, accumulation and final destination, from the sea surface down to the sediment at the bottom floor of the oceans or along the coastlines, are partially unknown and not completely understood. Plastic pollution at sea is induced by both maritime and inland sources. The contribution of the inland source is often estimated to be 80% in comparison of the maritime contribution (UNEP source). To better quantify global plastic pollution transport and to effectively reduce sources and risks, a thorough understanding of origin, transport, fate, and input of plastic debris from rivers remains crucial. Complementing the traditional Eulerian approach, Lagrangian ocean framework is a powerful way to analyze the ocean circulation or dynamics. The main purpose is based on large sets of virtual (passive or fictive) particles whose displacements (trajectories) are integrated with the full depth or surface ocean current field. Among the expectations, questions about pathways and flow connectivity can be addressed and it avoids the classical use of passive tracer. In the generalized methodology, the analyses include the use of the ocean currents, the determination of the initial positions of the particle (knowns also as the seeding strategy) and the computation of trajectories under physical assumptions, and finally their post-treatment (qualification of their final status). The fate of floating plastic pollution discharged along the coasts has been recently studied at the global scale by comparing two seeding strategies, one based on river discharges and the other one on the mismanaged waste from coastal populations, under the same framework of a Lagrangian numerical analysis from a global ocean circulation model [1]. These latest results show that about 1/3 of the particles end up in the open ocean and 2/3 on the coastlines (as defined by the ocean model). The seeding strategy largely influences the accumulation of particles toward the main subtropical convergence zones, such as in the South Pacific and the North Atlantic, as being mostly fed by the coastal population inputs. Such study clearly highlights the importance of the initial seeding scenario and also revealed that the stranding of particles that occurs mainly locally, could have a significant long-distance impact, allowing for a certain global and basin scale connectivity. Plastic pollution from inland sources mostly enters the ocean through rivers, and a large part is coming from South-East Asian countries. In the particular case of Indonesia, several factors introduce complexity in the consideration of the marine litter problem, including a high population density, one of the highest level of rainfall in the world, with an interannual variability linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and finally a shoreline particularly jagged with approximately 13, 550 islands of various sizes with many narrow straits for a total coastline length greater than 81, 000 km (which are the reasons why Indonesia is also known as the maritime continent). A strategy for considering the global problem of marine litter at the regional scale of Indonesia should consider all these aforementioned aspects. The present study considers the dispersion of marine floating litter based on some state-of-art numerical estimations of oceanic movements and currents. The potential impacts of the windage (wind drag) but also the tides and waves effect, are investigated under a specific seeding scenario with regards to discharges of the main rivers flowing along the Indonesian coasts.', 'Plastic waste accumulating in the global ocean is an increasingly threatening environmental issue. To date, the floating and thus most visible fraction of ocean plastic pollution has been mapped at global scale. Yet, large knowledge gaps exist in our current understanding of the transport and transformation processes of positively buoyant plastic debris at the sea surface. Observations at sea typically report an apparent scarcity of microplastics (<5 mm) relative to the expected abundance-size distribution based on fragmentation of larger plastic objects. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the relative abundance of microplastics (>500 µm) and mesoplastics (0.5-5 cm) in the surface waters of the eastern North Pacific Ocean using data from 1136 040 plastic fragments collected by 679 neuston trawl deployments between 2015 and 2019. Our results reveal that the apparent microplastic scarcity is not uniformly distributed across the region. Instead, we show that the relative abundance of floating microplastics increases from the outside to the inside of the North Pacific Garbage Patch. We hypothesize that this observation could be explained by (i) a spatially variable microplastic removal due to spatial differences in ocean productivity, (ii) a differential dispersal of micro- vs. mesoplastics with a preferential accumulation of microplastics in the subtropical gyre, and/or (iii) the timescales associated with transport and fragmentation of plastic objects at the ocean surface with older, more degraded, floating plastic accumulation in subtropical gyres. The results presented here highlight that global estimates of the accumulation and removal of positively buoyant microplastics need to consider spatial aspects such as variations in ocean productivity, the dominant physical transport processes in a given area, as well as the time needed for a plastic object to reach the specific offshore location.']"

We investigated microplastic pollution in surface sediments in the northern South China Sea to explore its distribution characteristics and influencing factors across the continental shelf, continental slope, and deep-sea environments. It was found that the microplastic abundance of surface sediments was 130.56 ± 40.48 items/kg. The average abundance of microplastics in all three topographic areas gradually decreased with increasing distance offshore. However, the differences in microplastic diversity indices between the three areas were not significant and were higher than those in other seas of the world, indicating that the waters of the northern South China Sea are rich in microplastics from complex sources, with more pollution input channels. In the continental shelf, fibrous and low density microplastics accounted for the largest amount, with a low degree of microplastic aging, and were mostly transported by suspended-load. These microplastics were mainly influenced by human activities. In the deep sea, microplastics with higher density were the most abundant and the number of fibrous microplastics was fewer, while the average size was larger, mainly influenced by the bottom currents. These microplastics underwent long-term bedload transport. In the continental slope, the main factors affecting the distribution of microplastics were more complex. In addition to pollution by human activities, the slope also receives microplastic materials carried by bottom currents; therefore, the composition of microplastics in the slope combines those characteristics of microplastics in both the continental shelf and deep-sea areas. The findings of this study indicate that the South China Sea is affected by complex pollution sources under the dual effects of human activities and natural conditions; in particular, the pollution situation in the deep-sea area needs extensive attention.', 'Microplastics are emerging contaminants and have attracted widespread environmental concerns about their negative effects on the marine ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the abundances, distributions and characteristics of microplastics in surface seawater and sediments from the North Yellow Sea. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics was 545 ± 282 items/m 3 in surface seawater and 37.1 ± 42.7 items/kg dry weight in sediments, representing a medium microplastic pollution level compared with other sea areas. Small microplastics (<1 mm) made up >70% of the total microplastic numbers. Films and fibers were the dominant shapes of microplastics in both the surface seawater and sediments. Transparent microplastics were generally more common than microplastics of other colors. Based on the identification by a Fourier transform infrared microscope, polyethylene (PE) was the dominant composition of microplastics in surface seawater, while polypropylene (PP) was the most common polymer type in sediments. These results will improve our understanding of the environmental risks posed by microplastics to marine ecosystems.', 'Marine microplastics are emerging pollutants in the ocean and have become a major global environmental issue in recent decades. However, microplastic pollution has not been frequently studied in the oligotrophic oceanic regions around the Xisha Islands, the largest marine coral reef area of China. In this study, microplastics in surface seawater were sampled from 30 stations in the region around the Xisha Islands. Marine microplastics were classified via a microscopic method using an Olympus stereo microscope. Microplastic photographs were taken by an inner imaging system, and the size of the microplastics was estimated using Image J software. Additionally, a portion of the microplastic samples was randomly selected for component analysis based on the shape, color, and size of the particles. Our results indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in the surface seawater of the Xisha region. The abundance of microplastics was in the range of 10-130 pieces/m3, with an average value of 54.7 pieces/m3. The size range of microplastics was 0.02-5 mm with the length of 0.02-1 mm accounting for 32.1% and the length of 1-3 mm accounting for 64.8% of the total abundance. The microplastics from the Xisha region can be classified into five color types, namely transparent, blue, black, green, and red, with the average percentages being 56.8%, 40.2%, 1.2%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, the local microplastics can be divided into fiber and film according to their morphology with fiber accounting for more than 99% of the total abundance. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) were the two major chemical components of the microplastics, accounting for 56.2% and 20.3% of the chemical components, respectively. The average concentration of microplastics in Xisha region is relatively lower than that in many other regions of the South China Sea, as well as that in other regions of the global oceans. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of microplastics is influenced by water movement, anthropogenic activities, and topographic features in the Xisha region. Although there is a large spatial variation in the surface seawater in the Xisha region, the concentration of microplastics in the near-shore stations is typically high, which may indicate that the microplastics in these areas originate from terrestrial sources. On the other hand, a reduced wave energy due to the topographic structure of shallow coral reefs allows more microplastics to settle and accumulate in the nearshore waters around the islands. Meanwhile, there were nearshore stations (S12, S19, S22) with low microplastic abundance, particularly in areas with high internal tides caused by local topography, strong mixing or upwelling induced by internal tides, and waves. These phenomena can bring subsurface waters to the surface and thus lead to the dilution of surface seawater pollutants at the nearshore stations. Analysis of microplastic morphology revealed the presence of large-diameter microplastic fibers in the surface seawater of the Xisha region, which may indicate that these microplastics are young in age. Most likely, they originated from recent fishery activities in the region, as both PET and PP are common types of plastics used in local fishery operations. Furthermore, microplastics have already been found in local soil samples and in the bodies of seabirds living on the Xisha Islands, due to an increase in island development and construction. Therefore, plastic waste discharge caused by increasing human activities may be another important source of microplastics to the surface seawater of the Xisha region.']"

However, the potential human health risks and impacts of microplastics remain largely unexplored. By providing an overview regarding the interaction of microplastics and human health, this review extends current knowledge on the potential impacts of microplastics pollution on humans from an environmental health perspective. The paper firstly presents the characteristics of microplastics as well as the status of global microplastics pollution. As for human health, the potential hazards of microplastics are reflected by toxic chemical components, vectors of contaminants, and physical damage. Extensive microplastic pollution on ecosystems due to human activities leads to inevitable human exposure, which may occur by dietary, inhalation and/or skin contact. Accordingly, microplastics exposure is closely associated with human health. This study explores the potential interactions of microplastics with the biological organization at various levels, including chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, and system levels. The review concludes by highlighting five urgent perspectives and implications for future research on microplastics: 1) Developing a standard terminology and research methods; 2) Reinforcing microplastics pollution governance; 3) Exploring innovative strategies and technologies; 4) Engaging the public and change behaviour; and 5) Adopting a transdisciplinary approach."", 'While versatile application of plastics has generated huge benefits in our life, the ‘plastic end-of-life’ comes with downsides of emerging concern is plastic particles within all parts of environments. Plastics are highly resistant to degradation and sustain in the environment for a prolonged period resulting in easy access of microplastics into human food chain. Microplastic exposure to humans is caused by foods of both animal and plant origin, food additives, drinks, and plastic food packaging. Living organisms can accumulate microplastics in cells and tissues which results in threats of chronic biological effects and potential health hazards for humans including body gastrointestinal disorders, immunity, respiratory problem, cancer, infertility, and alteration in chromosomes. Because of the threat of microplastics on human health, it is essential to ensure food safety as well as control plastic use with strict regulation of proper management. This study aims to enlighten future research into the core component of microplastics, their exposure to human food, prevention to human food chain, and biological reactions in human body. Finally, it is recommended to consider the presence of microplastics in different foods, as most of the existing research mainly focused on sea foods. And it is important to study the mechanism of toxicity with pathways in the human body based on the different types, shapes, and sizes of plastic particles.', 'Plastics are a group of synthetic materials made of organic polymers and some additives with special characteristics. Plastics have become part of our daily life due to their many applications and uses. However, inappropriately managed plastic waste has raised concern regarding their ecotoxicological and human health risks in the long term. Due to the non-biodegradable nature of plastics, their waste may take several thousands of years to partially degrade in natural environments. Plastic fragments/particles can be very minute in size and are mistaken easily for prey or food by aquatic organisms (e.g., invertebrates, fishes). The surface properties of plastic particles, including large surface area, functional groups, surface topography, point zero charge, influence the sorption of various contaminants, including heavy metals, oil spills, PAHs, PCBs and DDT. Despite the fact that the number of studies on the biological effects of plastic particles on biota and humans has been increasing in recent years, studies on mixtures of plastics and other chemical contaminants in the aquatic environment are still limited. This review aims to gather information about the main characteristics of plastic particles that allow different types of contaminants to adsorb on their surfaces, the consequences of this adsorption, and the interactions of plastic particles with aquatic biota. Additionally, some missing links and potential solutions are presented to boost more research on this topic and achieve a holistic view on the effects of micro-and nanoplastics to biological systems in aquatic environments. It is urgent to implement measures to deal with plastic pollution that include improving waste management, monitoring key plastic particles, their hotspots, and developing their assessment techniques, using alternative products, determining concentrations of micro-and nanoplastics and the contaminants in freshwater and marine food-species consumed by humans, applying clean-up and remediation strategies, and biodegradation strategies.']"

Even through stranded plastic debris may not interact directly with marine organisms, backwash processes may transport this debris back to coastal waters, where it may affect a wide range of marine life at different trophic levels. This study analysed the size distribution of stranded plastic debris (<10 mm) collected from eight coastal beaches in Guangdong Province, China. Polystyrene (PS) foams and fragments smaller than 7 mm were increasingly abundant in the smaller size classes, whereas resin pellets remained in their production sizes (∼3 mm). Microplastics (<5 mm) accounted for over 98% of the total plastic debris by abundance and 71% by weight, indicating that the plastic debris on these coastal beaches was highly fragmented and the majority of the plastic masses belonged to the microplastic size range. The observed size distributions of PS foams and fragments are believed to result from continued fragmentation. Previous studies found that the residence time of beached debris was less than one year on average, and no sign of plastic accumulation with depth in beach sediment was observed. Therefore, coastal beaches may represent a reservoir of highly fragmented and degraded microplastics that may be mobilised and returned to the sea during storm events. Further research on the dynamics and longevity of microplastics on beaches will help reveal the mass balance of microplastics on the shoreline and determine whether shorelines are sinks or sources of microplastics.', 'Land-based sources are the key sources of plastic debris, and mismanaged plastic debris can eventually enter the ocean via marine beaches. In this study, the spatial distribution and amount of plastic debris in the land-based source input zone of First Long Beach (FLB), China, which is a major tourist attraction, were first investigated. By using field investigation, sand samples were collected from two sections on FLB adjacent to land-based sources in December 2019, and the plastic debris in the sand samples was quantified and characterized in the laboratory. The amount of plastic debris ranged from 2 to 82 particles/m2 on this marine sand beach. There was a significant difference in plastic debris amount between the transects along the land-based source input zone (p < 0.05) due to the impacts of wind, ocean currents, and waves. The most abundant size of plastics was 0.5–2.5 cm (44.4%). Moreover, the most common color was white (60.9%). The most abundant shape of plastic debris fell into the fragment category (76.2%). The plastic debris amounts were significantly correlated with multiple sizes. Our results show that land-based wastewater discharge is a large plastic debris source on FLB under coastal water tide variation. Reduction strategies should be carried out by tracing the various land-based sources of plastic debris.', 'Plastic debris contamination in marine environments is a global problem that poses a considerable threat to the sustainability and health of coastal ecosystems. Marine beaches, as the key zones where terrestrial plastic debris reach coastal waters, are faced with the increasing pressures of human activities. In this study, we explored the distribution, composition, and inventory of plastic debris over seasonal and tidal zones at the Yugang Park Beach (YPB) in Zhanjiang Bay, South China Sea, to provide a baseline for plastic debris on a marine beach. The results showed mean abundance of plastic debris in summer (6.00 ± 2.10 items/m2) was significantly greater than that in winter (3.75 ± 2.12 items/m2). In addition, the composition of plastic debris ranged in size mainly from 1 to 5 mm and 0.5 to 2.5 cm in winter and summer, respectively. In terms of composition, white plastic debris was the most common (81.1%), and foam was the most abundant (64.4%). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the abundance of plastic debris and sand grain size fraction (p < 0.05), implying the abundances of microplastic debris were more easily impacted by sand grain size (>2 mm). In total inventory, there were about 1.18 × 105 and 2.95 × 105 items of plastic debris on the YPB in winter and summer, respectively. The tidal variation and human activities are responsible for the plastic debris accumulation. This study provided a method to quantify the inventory of plastic debris on a beach and could be helpful to consider regional tidal variations and critical source areas for effective plastic debris clean-up.']"

However, developing machine learning-based detection and identification algorithms requires large amounts of data. Indeed, when it comes to marine debris, ground validated data is scarce. In this study, we propose a general methodology that leverages synthetic data in order to avoid overfitting and generalizes well. The idea is to utilize realistic models of spaceborne optical image acquisition and marine litter to generate large amounts of data to train the machine learning algorithms. These can then be used to detect marine pollution automatically on real satellite images. The main contribution of our study is showing that algorithms trained on simulated data can be successfully transferred to real-life situations. We present the general components of our framework, our modeling of satellites and marine debris and a proof of concept implementation for macro-plastic detection with Sentinel-2 images. In this case study, we generated a large dataset (more than 16,000 pixels of marine debris) composed of seawater, plastic, and wood and trained a Random Forest classifier on it. This classifier, when tested on real satellite images, successfully discriminates marine litter from seawater, thus proving the effectiveness of our approach and paving the way for machine learning-based marine litter detection with even more representative simulation models.', 'Plastic pollution in coastal and marine areas is an ongoing environmental concern in the world. Despite its growing concern worldwide, there is a knowledge gap in terms of its detection and quantification of spatial distribution patterns. In this review paper, we investigated the existing trends in monitoring marine and beached (macro and meso) plastic debris using remote sensing techniques. Marine plastic debris monitoring using remote sensing data is highly complex, partially due to the constraints in spatial and spectral resolutions as well as due to the differences in surface reflectance properties of different polymers. Modern remote sensing with high-quality data, including airborne, spaceborne, and data taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), have revolutionized marine litter mapping. UAV platform offers a promising and cost-effective way for mapping both floating and beached marine plastic debris compared to data from other platforms. Automatic and manual delineation for mapping marine plastic litters can be applied depending on the objective of the study. For assisting beach clean-up processes, automatic detection of marine plastic debris is enough for locating the worksite. For detailed characterization of debris, including type, size and material, manual delineation of high resolution images is necessary. More accurate mapping of marine plastics can be achieved by developing detailed spectral libraries with material level details and launching dedicated sensors for marine litter mapping in the future. Challenges exist in mapping submerged marine plastics, plastic materials conglomerated with biomass and unaccounted for beached marine litter buried along the coasts due to accretion and erosion.', 'This study proposes a marine debris monitoring methods using satellite and drone multispectral images.

And for the detection of marine debris using drone multispectral images, performance evaluation and comparison of U-Net, DeepLabv3+ (ResNet50) and DeepLabv3+ (Inceptionv3) among deep learning models were performed (mIoU 0.68). As a result of marine debris detection using satellite image, the F1-Score was 0.97. Marine debris detection using drone multispectral images was performed on vegetative debris and plastics. As a result of detection, when DeepLabv3+ (Inceptionv3) was used, the most model accuracy, mean intersection over union (mIoU), was 0.68. Vegetative debris showed an F1-Score of 0.93 and IoU of 0.86, while plastics showed low performance with an F1-Score of 0.5 and IoU of 0.33. However, the F1-Score of the spectral index applied to generate plastic mask images was 0.81, which was higher than the plastics detection performance of DeepLabv3+ (Inceptionv3), and it was confirmed that plastics monitoring using the spectral index was possible.

Information on the types and fishery-specific causes of derelict fishing gear (DFG) as well as fishers' behaviour contributing to marine debris is lacking from several fishing-intense regions of the world. The present study investigated the contribution of commercial fishing activities to marine plastic debris in the coastal Indian state of Kerala, using data from a survey of 390 fishers operating trawl, seine, gillnet and trammel net gear types as well as a litter assessment on 25 beaches. The findings suggested that the mismanagement of plastic wastes onboard fishing vessels and the loss/discard of fishing gear are the major causes of DFG in the region. The disposal practice of damaged fishing gear, galley waste and debris caught during fishing activities differed among different fishing gear users. Discarding damaged nets on beaches was a common practice among non-motorized gillnet users. Trawl and ring seine fishers threw debris caught during fishing back into the sea, whereas shore seine and mini trawl fishers disposed of it on the shore. Lack of waste collection facilities was the main reason (93 % of respondents) for improper disposal of damaged fishing gear and other plastic litter. DFG was the largest single-category litter (53.4 %) in terms of weight along the beaches of Kerala. Ropes (including rope cut-offs), gillnets/gillnet pieces and trawl pieces formed the major share of DFG. The abundance of DFG on the beaches had a positive correlation with the number of fishing vessels operated from there. The high share of DFG along the Kerala coast highlights the need to prioritize the fishing sector in management efforts to reduce marine litter. Given the anticipated rapid growth in global fishing activities, it is imperative to develop sector-specific plastic litter quantification and management strategies to tackle the growing problem of marine debris."", 'Derelict fishing gear is a highly visible source of marine plastic pollution, causing mortality and ecosystem degradation with uncertain long-term consequences. The quantity of derelict gear entering the oceans remains unknown because of heterogeneity in fishing gear and effort, as well as inadequate monitoring. Prior studies have been limited in scope to specific fisheries and regions, and large-scale estimates lack an empirical basis. It is critically important for decision makers to have credible information in order to design effective remediation efforts. We estimated the amount of industrial fishing effort and the associated plastic debris entering the ocean globally each year from lost fishing gear. Using remote observations of fishing vessel activity paired with technical fishing gear models, we generated a bounding estimate for gear operation and loss worldwide in 2018. We estimate that industrial trawl, purse-seine and pelagic longline fisheries operated 2.1 Mt of plastic gear over 2018 to obtain 49.7 Mt of retained and discarded catch, representing 74% of industrial marine capture globally. The median estimate for plastic gear lost during the use of these gear types was 48.4 kt (95% confidence interval: 28.4–99.5 kt). This estimate excludes abandoned and discarded gear. Improved observation, especially of small-scale fisheries, is needed to better understand the sources of derelict gear. These findings serve as a benchmark for future monitoring and management efforts to reduce derelict gear in the global ocean.', 'Abandoned, Lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) comprises a significant part of global marine plastic pollution, with adverse consequences for fishers, the seafood industry, and marine wildlife and habitats. To effectively prevent and reduce ALDFG at source, an understanding of the major causes of and drivers behind fishing gear losses is required. We interviewed 451 fishers from seven countries around the world (Belize, Iceland, Indonesia, Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, and the United States of America) representing five key fishing gear types (gillnets, purse seine nets, trawl nets, longlines, and pots and traps) about why and under what circumstances they lose their gear. We also asked them their views on the most effective interventions to reduce gear losses. Across all major gear types and countries where interviews were undertaken, bad weather was the most common cause of gear loss, followed by interactions with wildlife (identified as a cause for loss by 81% and 65% of all fishers interviewed, respectively). Snagging gear on a bottom obstruction was a major cause of loss for gears that contact the seafloor, along with conflicts with other fishers, often via gear and vessel interactions, for gillnet and pot and trap fishers. Operational and behavioral characteristics such as gear type, trip length, and the party responsible to pay for gear repairs and replacements all significantly influenced gear losses. Gear maintenance was the most effective gear loss prevention measure across all gear types and countries reported by fishers, followed by training crew in gear management (identified as an effective prevention measure by 95% and 82% of all fishers interviewed, respectively). Actions available to fishers, managers and port operators to effectively prevent fishing gear losses include: gear maintenance; reducing active gear interactions with wildlife; reducing financial and administrative burdens for port reception facilities; reducing trip lengths; and targeting education and gear stewardship programs to fishers with limited ALDFG awareness, particularly those in low income fisheries and countries.']"

Microplastic pollution in the soil environment has thus begun to elicit great concern. This review summarizes the observed effects of microplastic pollution on soil ecosystems as well as sorption and transport behaviors of microplastics in such environments. Microplastic pollution has been detected in various soils including agricultural/farmland, greenhouse, home garden, coastal, industrial, and floodplain soils. Microplastics affect soil physical and chemical properties, microbial and enzyme activities, and plant growth, and also pose adverse ecotoxicological effects to soil fauna. These effects depend on the concentration, size, and shape of microplastics, as well as soil texture. Microplastics are known to sorb organic and inorganic pollutants, possibly affecting the distribution of these substances in soil. Existing evidence demonstrates the negligible effect of microplastics on bioaccumulation of contaminants in soil fauna. The horizontal and vertical transport of microplastics can be facilitated by soil fauna. Pollutants associated with microplastics may disperse further following the transport of microplastics in soil. This review also highlights perspectives for future research on microplastics in soil. (Figure presented.).', 'Microplastics are ubiquitous in soil ecosystems all over the world through source and migration. It is even estimated that the content of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems exceeds the number of microplastics entering sea ecosystems. However, compared with the research on microplastics in marine ecosystems, the research and discussion on microplastics in soil ecosystems are still less. Transportation, film mulching and sewage sludge are three main sources of soil microplastics. The abundance, polymer type, size and shape of the microplastics are related to the source and they help to clarify the source. The characteristics of microplastics, farming measures, soil animal activities and other factors promote the migration of microplastics, which bring new challenges to the soil ecosystems and humans. This article summarizes the latest research findings on the effects of soil microplasticity on soil properties, plants, animals and microorganisms. The analysis methods of microplastics in soil can refer to the analysis methods of microplastics of aquatic sediments, because soil and aquatic sediments are similar, both of which are complex solid substrates. At present, the development of analytical methods is limited due to the complex matrix of soil and the small volume of microplastics, which requires continuous development and innovation. Through the summary and analysis of related articles, this article reviews the distribution, sources, migration, influence and analysis methods of soil microplastics. This article also critically analyzes the deficiencies in the studies of microplastics in the soil ecosystems, and made some suggestions for future work. The microplastics in soil ecosystems need further research and summary, which will help people further understand the potential hazards of microplastics.', 'The prevalence of microplastics in soil has recently attracted substantial interest as they pose a major threat to the agricultural ecosystem. Microplastics (MPs), though widely found in marine habitats and explored in detail, their presence in agricultural soil remains relatively unexplored. Microplastics are entering the environment either directly through manufactured particles or those originating from the breakdown of larger macroplastics. In soil, microplastics can be transported both horizontally and vertically through the soil fauna. Hence, in order to understand the possible threats posed by microplastics in soil to the environment, this review aims in conducting a meta–analysis to integrate the recent studies in sources, fate and migration of microplastics into agriculture, impacts on soil health, trophic transfers to food chains and the associated adverse impact on soil biota. Results reveals that major sources of microplastics in soil includes sludge followed by wastewater and mulch film. Its effect on soil properties depends on the soil type, size, concentration and type of polymer. Though the occurrence of microplastics in soil has been reported in various countries, its presence in various other countries is still unexplored. Furthermore, several studies validates the effect of microplastics on soil biota at various trophic stages and even endanger human health by food chains. MPs exert both ecotoxicity and genotoxicity in plants. It delays germination by affecting both the vegetative and reproductive growth of plants. It also affects the ecosystem through the sorption of organic and inorganic pollutants. Nevertheless, detailed insights on the effect of microplastics on soil beneficial organisms and the trophic transfer onto humans requires further studies.']"

Microplastics have a large specific surface area and strong hydrophobicity, and thus they can easily adsorb organic pollutants in the water environment. Due to their size close to the fee-ding diameter of aquatic organisms, they are easy to be ingested by organisms and enriched along the food webs, which has attracted worldwide attention in recent years. The current articles on microplastics have done a thorough investigation on the distribution and quantity of microplastics in the environment, and a lot of research has been conducted on the adsorption principles and kinetics of microplastics and typical pollutants. However, the sampling met-hods for the investigation of microplastics in the environment are not uniform, and the models for analyzing migration and biological effects of microplastics are simple and weakly adaptable. In addition, the research on the compound environmental effects caused by the interaction of microplastics and environmental pollutants is insufficient, and the integrity of the environmental behavior and biological effects of microplastics are easily ignored. In this paper, the distribution and abundance of microplastics in the environment and the adsorption of organic pollutants in the environment by microplastics are introduced; and then the presence of microplastics on persistent organic pollutants in the water environment of distribution and bioavailability are analyzed; the types and properties of microplastics, the types of pollutants, environmental conditions and other factors on the environmental behavior of microplastics are also discussed; finally, the combined biological effects of microplastics and organic pollutants are discussed in combination with the characteristics of microplastics and organic pollutants, and the size of microplastics. There are many types of microplastics and they interact closely with pollutants in environmental media. Therefore, it is of great significance to discuss the environmental behavior of microplastics in combination with the interaction characteristics of microplastics with pollutants and environmental characteristics.', ""The widespread presence of microplastics in global aquatic ecosystems has aroused growing concern about the potential impacts of microplastics on aquatic biota. In marine and freshwater environments, microplastics are distributed pervasively within water bodies from the upper water column to the bottom layer, making them available to a large variety of aquatic organisms that inhabit different locations. The ingestion of microplastic particles may cause harm to aquatic organisms. Although China's aquatic environments have been seriously polluted by microplastics, the impacts of microplastics on aquatic biota remain to be elucidated. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about microplastic pollution in aquatic biota in China; specifically, the concentration and characteristics of microplastic particles in aquatic organisms from both seawater and freshwater environments are discussed. The results showed that various aquatic organisms in China have been found to consume microplastics. The average number of microplastic pieces discovered in biota ranged from 0.07 particles to 164 particles per individual in different organisms. The most frequently observed colors of microplastics detected in biota were blue and transparent, and the detected microplastics mainly consisted of fibers. In addition, the impacts of microplastics on aquatic organisms, including physical impacts, chemical impacts, the trophic transfer of microplastics and the potential risks to humans, were discussed.

This study aims to review the scientific literature related microplastic research in different environmental compartments and to identify the research gaps for the assessment of future research priorities.

The papers identified for seas, estuaries, rivers and lakes are further classified according to (i) occurrence and characterization (ii) uptake by and effects in organisms, and (iii) fate and transport issues.

In this work, settling experiments with pristine and biofilm-colonized microplastic particles were combined with model calculations to evaluate settling velocities, particle distributions, and residence times in the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion of a hypothetical stratified lake broadly based on Upper Lake Constance. Settling velocities of various biodegradable and nonbiodegradable polymers of various shapes, sizes, and biofilm colonization were measured in a settling column. The settling velocities ranged between ~ 0.30 and ~ 50 mm s−1. Particle sizes and polymer densities were identified as primary controls on settling rates. Microplastic particles that had been exposed to a lake environment for up to 30 weeks were colonized by a range of biofilms and associated extracellular polymeric substances; surprisingly, however, the settling velocity did not vary significantly between pristine and colonized microplastic particles. Simulated microplastic residence times in the model lake varied over a wide range of time scales (10−1 to 105 d) and depended mainly on the size of the particles and depth of the lake layer. Long residence times on the order of 105 d (for 1-μm microplastic particles) imply that for small microplastic particles there is a high probability that they will be taken up at some stage by lake organisms. As the lake retention time (~ 4.5 years) is considerably shorter than the residence time of small microplastics, negligible quantities of these microplastic particles should be found in the lake sediment unless some other process increases their settling velocity.', 'Microplastic (mP) pollution has been indicated as an area of concern in the marine environment. However, there is no consensus on their potential to cause significant ecological harm, and a comprehensive risk assessment of mP pollution is unattainable due to gaps in our understanding of their transport, uptake, and exchange processes. This research considers drag models that have been proposed to calculate the terminal settling velocity of regularly and irregularly shaped particles to assess their applicability in a mP modeling context. The evaluation indicates three models that predict the settling velocity of mPs to a high precision and suggests that an explicit model is the most appropriate for implementation in a mP transport model. This research demonstrates that the mP settling velocity does not vary significantly over time and depth relevant to the scale of an ocean model and that the terminal settling velocity is independent of the initial particle velocity. These findings contribute toward efforts to simulate the vertical transport of mPs in the ocean, which will improve our understanding of the residence time of mPs in the water column and subsequently their availability for uptake into the marine ecosystem.', 'Physical and dynamic properties of marine microplastic (MP) particles are summarized, with relevance to their behavior in the coastal zone. The density range, size classes, and typical particle shapes are presented, and their variation with time due to weathering, biofouling, and mechanical degradation in the swash zone is considered. The dependence of the time rate of increase of integral particle density on the particle shape due to its biofouling shows that floating fibers and threads (“one-dimensional” (1-D) particles) are the first to begin sinking, followed by 2-D films and flakes, and then 3-D fragments. Mechanical fragmentation in the swash zone of plastic samples made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and foamed polystyrene (foamed PS) shows qualitative features of the generated MP particles and indicates that increase in mass of MPs with time is exponential. Dynamic behavior of MPs is discussed on the base of knowledge from classical hydrodynamics, marine sedimentology, and physical oceanography. Shape-dependent manner of the particle sinking and the value of the terminal settling velocity are characterized in terms of the particle size, density, and angularity. Critical velocity of resuspension by a unidirectional flow is addressed in terms of the Shields diagram, summarizing available published data on laboratory experiments on the particles with properties similar to those of MPs. Consideration of motion of particles in an oscillatory flow under surface waves and in roll structures illuminates mechanisms of mixing of MPs and natural marine debris. Analysis of the observed sorting of sediment grains under the influence of surface waves raises the question of probable sorting of MPs in the water column of the coastal zone, leading to different transport for different kinds of MP particles, including the offshore export of smaller MPs, onshore transport of larger particles, and possible effect of arresting of finer MPs under coarser sediment grains. Typical velocity scales of natural convective flows and upward/downward motions within the Langmuir circulation cells are shown to be of the same order of magnitude as the settling velocity of common MPs-units of centimeters per second-which suggests the importance of these mixing mechanisms for the motion of MP particles. As a natural case study, the events of washouts of heavily intermixed patches of seaweed, amber stones, and MPs onto the beaches of the Baltic Sea after severe storms are examined. It is concluded that stormy episodes seem to bring repeatedly larger plastics to the surf and swash zone and export smaller pieces offshore.']"

This study reports marine debris ingested by green sea turtles Chelonia mydas and loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta that stranded along the eastern coast of the Sharjah Emirate in the United Arab Emirates. We observed that both green and loggerhead sea turtles frequently ingest (Frequency of Occurrence: 75.0% and 57.1% respectively) high quantities of marine debris, particularly plastics. The results suggest that green sea turtles are more likely to ingest soft items such as threads and sheets while loggerheads are more likely to ingest hard items. When considering the quantity, frequency and nature of ingested marine debris as well as the physiology of specific species and age classes, green sea turtles, particularly younger specimens, ingest the greatest amount of marine debris.', ""Digestive tracts from 51 sea turtle carcasses that washed ashore on the east and west coasts of Florida were examined for the presence of anthropogenic debris. Debris was found in 24 of 43 green turtles (Chelonia mydas), 0 of 7 Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempi), and 1 of 1 loggerhead (Caretta caretta). Ingested debris included plastic, monofilament line, fish hooks, rubber, aluminium foil, and tar. For green turtles, ingestion of debris was not significantly affected by location of stranding, season, or body size. Debris ingestion was significantly affected by sex of the turtle. Frequency of occurrence of debris was significantly higher in females, but differences in the mass or volume of ingested debris were not significantly different between the sexes. Although frequency of occurrence of debris was high in green turtles (56%), the mass and volume of the debris were small-mean 0.52% of wet mass of gut contents and mean 0.72% of the volume of gut contents, respectively. However, small quantities of debris can kill sea turtles; the death of at least two turtles in this study resulted from debris ingestion. The debris in the two turtles represented 4.6% and 5.8% of wet mass and 3.2% and 9.8% of volume of the gut contents, respectively. In both turtles, the debris represented inflated percentages because the turtles had not been feeding normally prior to death because the debris affected gut function.

In 1983 we began systematic surveys to quantify the incidence of entanglement and to examine the effects of entanglement-related mortality on the population growth of each species. The incidence of entanglement observed among pinnipeds that were hauled out at San Nicolas and San Miguel islands was greater from December 1984 through July 1986 (California sea lions, 0.16%; northern elephant seals, 0.16%; harbour seals, 0.09%) than it was from December 1983 through November 1984 (California sea lions, 0.08%; northern elephant seals, 0.15% harbour seals, 0.05%). However, only about one-half, or fewer, of the entangled California sea lions and northern elephant seals were evidently entangled in synthetic debris. Additional cases of entanglement were probably related to commercial fishing operations rather than to marine debris. Trends in abundance of pinnipeds in Southern California have apparently not been significantly influenced by entanglement of individuals in marine debris. Juveniles may be the most susceptible to entanglement in debris and the effects of any recent declines in survival of younger age classes on trends in annual numbers of births may not be detectable for several years.

However, studies on the occurrence and removal efficiency of MPs in WWTPs are still scarce, especially in African countries. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the abundance of MPs in the influent and effluent of two WWTPs (Aourir and M'zar) from the Agadir metropolis (Moroccan Atlantic). The two WWTPs receive different wastewater inputs (domestic and industrial). In addition, the impacts of seasonality on the fate and removal efficiency were investigated. The results showed that the MPs abundance in the wastewater decreased from 188 MPs/L in the influent to 50 MPs/L in the effluent for Aourir WWTP (domestic inputs); while the abundance was greater in the M'zar WWTP (urban and industrial inputs) recording a mean value of 519 MPs/L and 86 MPs/L in the influent and effluent, respectively. MPs collected in the Aourir WWTP ranged from 290 to 3200 μm, while MPs from the M'zar WWTP, ranged from 330 to 4200 μm. Overall, the size range of 100–500 μm was the most abundant for both WWTPs. Fibers were the highest MPs morphotype found, followed by fragments. MP colors were mainly red, black, blue, and transparent for both treatment plants. Additionally, FTIR spectroscopy showed the presence of eight different polymers, mainly polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). Seasonal variation analysis showed that MPs abundance in summer was significantly higher compared to other seasons. However, the comparison of the removal efficiency (RE) between the different seasons indicated that the winter season (74 %) recorded the highest RE for Aourir WWTP. Conversely, spring (87 %) recorded the highest RE for M'zar WWTP. SEM/EDX micrographs showed different degrees of weathering and chemical elements adhering to the surface of the MPs. The findings of the current study will serve as a baseline for future considerations about management strategies, wastewater reuse, as well as the understanding of the occurrence of microplastic pollution along the marine ecosystems of Morocco."", 'Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play a pivotal role in removal of microplastics (MPs) particles before the waste streams are discharged into aquatic environments. Indiscriminate disposal of the effluent and untreated wastewater not only contribute to accumulation of MP in the marine environment, but they can also act as a carrier for various hydrophobic compounds and contributors of pollutants that leach from them via natural degradation. In this assessment, we have summarized the MP concentrations in influent and effluent streams, and provide quantification of the discharges from these WWTPs. Almost 50% of the global wastewater influent of 3,562,082 × 105 m3 remains untreated. Some conservative estimates indicate that treated effluent disposal can add around 1.47 × 1015 MPs annually, whereas the discharge of untreated effluent is likely to add a staggering 3.85 × 1016 MPs annually to the aquatic environments. The efficiency of MP removal in wastewater treatment plants varies between 88 and 99.9%, indicating the potential of capturing the majority of the MP from escaping into the freshwater and marine environment. Based on WWTP removal efficiencies for MPs, calculations suggest that if all the globally produced wastewater was treated prior to release, a reduction of over 90% of the current amount of MP inputs into the aquatic environment could be achieved. From the number of studies conducted and assessments made on MPs in waste streams, it is obvious the methodologies followed were quite different, and the use of acids and heating are likely to deteriorate the MPs, emphasizing the need to develop harmonized protocols for microplastic assessment in wastewater treatment plants.', 'The increasing abundance of microplastics (MPs) in rivers and oceans continues to face major challenges. In particular, MPs with smaller particle sizes are difficult to identify and quantify when they reach the environment. This study investigated four typical wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), including urban WWTPs and industrial WWTP with different treatment technologies. The results showed that the average abundance of MPs in the influent and effluent was 538.67 ± 22.05 n/L to 1290 ± 65.26 n/L and 20.44 ± 1.19 n/L to 40.67 ± 11.12 n/L. The primary and secondary treatment processes can effectively remove MPs between 51.04% and 72.82% from wastewater. After tertiary treatments, the removal efficiency was further increased to more than 90%. The study aims to explore the removal mechanism of MPs in each stage of the wastewater treatment process and to reveal the fate of MPs in WWTPs, and help to understand their future monitoring to optimize the wastewater treatment process.']"

The effects of particle size, temperature, salinity, and concentration on the adsorption of TBC and HBCDs by microplastics are studied. Results indicate that the first-order adsorption kinetic model is more suitable than the pseudo-second-order kinetic model to describe adsorption. The equilibrium adsorption times are 15 h and 10 h for TBC and HBCDs, respectively. The adsorption capacity increases with the decrease in particle size. The adsorption capacity gradually increases at first and then decreases with the increase in salinity and temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity is at 15 °C and 14% salinity. Compared with the linear and Freundlich models, the Langmuir model is more suitable; this indicates that the main adsorption mechanism might be chemical adsorption.', 'Microplastics (MPs) are widely detected in wetlands as emerging pollutants of global concern. Co-occurrence of MPs and trace metals in wetlands is common and the vector effects of MPs on other environmental pollutants have been increasingly reported. However, the interaction of different MPs and trace metals under environmentally realistic conditions is not well understood. Here, we investigated the adsorption capacity of MPs for metals under simulated conditions of Poyang Lake wetlands in Jiang Xi, China, a Ramsar site of international importance for conservation and sustainable use. ICP-MS was used to quantify the amount of adsorbed metals onto different types of MPs. SEM-EDS and micro-FTIR were used to examine the morphological and chemical characteristics of MPs before and after metal adsorption. The influence of internal (polymer types and particle sizes of MPs) and external factors (water pH values, organic matters, ion strength, and sediment) on metal adsorption was systematically investigated. Metal adsorption equilibrium was most achieved at 72 h. The adsorption capacity of MP types to metal ions tended to decrease as PP > PE > PS, and the amount of adsorbed metals decreased as Cu > Pb > Cd. The amount of adsorbed metals generally decreased with the increase of particle size of MPs. With the increase of water pH and K+ strength, the adsorption of metals by MPs showed an increasing and then decreasing trend; the adsorption capacity of MPs increased with the increase of fulvic acid. Under the simulated sedimentary conditions, the adsorption of different metals by MPs also tended to be Cu > Pb > Cd, which was mainly determined by metal concentrations in the sediments collected in situ. The results of this study improve our understanding of metal-MP interaction under simulated environmental conditions, shedding new light on the environmental behavior of MPs and metals in wetlands.', 'In recent years, the composite pollution of microplastics with organic pollutants and heavy metal ions in the water environment, including their combined toxicity, has received increasing attention. However, the mechanism underlying the joint effect of antibiotics and heavy metals on the surface behavior of microplastics has not been reported. The primary purpose of this article was to analyze the adsorption of levofloxacin (OFL) onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in an aqueous solution. The adsorption behavior was studied using kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherm models, and the effects of several environmental factors, such as ionic strength, fulvic acid, and heavy metals, were determined. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms models indicated that the whole adsorption process was controlled by both intraparticle and outer diffusion, as well as chemical adsorption, which was the dominant mechanism. Based on the results of the thermodynamic experiment, the adsorption process was a nonspontaneous and exothermic reaction process. Furthermore, the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, and Cr3+ ions significantly promoted the adsorption of OFL, but the presence of Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions inhibited its adsorption. At the same time, the presence of the ionic strength and fulvic acid remarkably restricted the adsorption process. These findings confirmed that electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and halogen bond cooperation were the main adsorption mechanisms. This paper mainly discusses the interaction between combinations of pollutants with microplastics, which provides theoretical guidance for the interface behavior, migration and transformation of marine microplastics in the actual environment.']"

MPs are complex environmental contaminants as they bind to a wide range of other contaminants. MPs associated contaminants include toxic chemical substances that are used as additives during the plastic manufacturing process and adsorbed contaminants that co-exist with MPs in aquatic environments. With the transfer between the water column and sediments, and the migration within aquatic systems, such contaminants associated MPs potentially pose high risk to aquatic systems. However, only limited research has been undertaken currently to link the environmental risk associated with MPs occurrence and movement behaviour in aquatic systems. Given the significant environmental risk and current knowledge gaps, this review focuses on the role played by the abundance of different MP species in water and sediment compartments as well as provides the context for assessing and quantifying the multiple risks associated with the occurrence and movement behaviour of different MP types. Based on the review of past literature, it is found that the physicochemical properties of MPs influence the release/sorption of other contaminants and current MPs transport modelling studies have primarily focused on virgin plastics rather than aged plastics. Additionally, risk assessment of contaminants-associated MPs needs significantly more research. This paper consolidates the current state-of-the art knowledge on the source to sink movement behaviour of MPs and methodologies for assessing the risk of different MP species. Moreover, knowledge gaps and emerging trends in the field are also identified for future research endeavours.', 'The term ""microplastics"" (MPs) refers to fine plastics less than 5 mm in size and includes primary sources from the original production of small-sized particles and secondary sources from the degradation or fragmentation of large plastics. MPs have been widely detected in marine (estuaries, bays, coastal zones, deep seas, ocean waters and sediments), soils (farmlands, urban soils, wetlands, landfill and polar areas), freshwater (lakes, rivers, reservoirs, snow and ice, and sewage treatment plants) and sediments, atmosphere (outdoor and indoor airs), living organisms (plants, animals, microorganisms, human and pet faeces), and foods (table salts, drinking waters, beers, vegetables and pet foods). Besides, MPs could be acted as the vector for many environmental pollutants, pathogens and even antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Moreover, MPs can be taken up by various terrestrial and aquatic organisms and transfer along the food chain at various trophic levels. Thus, environmental MP pollution is becoming one of the most serious threats to the Earth\'s surface ecosystems which has attracted serious concern and extensive research by many governments and the scientific community worldwide. Up to now, comprehensive studies and reports on the latest multidisciplinary research progress on microplastics in multiple environmental media remain limited. From the perspectives of earth sciences, chemistry, biology, and management, this article systematically reviews the research progress on the abundance, distribution and sources of microplastics in the waters, soils, atmosphere, sediments and organisms; the separation and analytical methods of microplastics in multiple environmental media; the migration and prediction of microplastics in terrestrial, marine and atmospheric environments; the surface changes and biofilm formation on microplastics and their adsorption characterization of environmental pollutants, pathogens and ARGs; the biological uptake, accumulation and ecological risks of MPs; the food chain transfer and health risks of MPs; the physico-chemical fragmentation and biodegradation of MPs in the environment and their risk reduction strategies and techniques. Finally, the key scientific issues and future research directions of environmental microplastics are also proposed in this review, such as methdology breakthroughs in separation and identification of submicron and nanoscale microplastics; comprehensive study on the distribution, migration, transport and flux of microplastics in environmental multi-media at cross-reginal and global scale; comprehensive monitoring, quantitative characterization and long-term evaluating the impacts of environmental microplastics on ecosystems; and the systematic assessment of human health risks of microplastics to different populations.', 'Microplastics (MPs) are synthetic organic polymers. The particle sizes of MPs range from approximately 0.01 to 5 nm. The photodegradation of MPs is more difficult than that of bulk plastics. Therefore, MPs are regarded as potential persistent organic pollutants. Researches of MPs have become a hot spot, and lots of MPs studies were reported recently. Although there are a lot of studies on the migration, distribution, biological effects and analytical methods of MPs in natural environments, systematic and comprehensive review articles are emergent, especially for the recent literatures. The present work summarized the researches involving the migration, distribution, biological effects and analytical methods of MPs in recent years. MPs are generally divided into two types, primary MPs and secondary MPs. Primary MPs are intentionally designed and produced for certain purposes, while secondary MPs generate from the fragmentations of bulk plastics and the breakage of clothes fibers. Currently, researches of MPs distribution focus on in marine environments, and found that MPs distributed throughout the ocean, even in the north and south poles, driven by the flow of sea water. However, researches of on MPs distribution in fresh water and terrene are limited. Researches also showed that MPs could migrate among terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments, where freshwater environments affected the migration and interaction of MPs between terrene and marine environments. Studies of biological effects of MPs focus on two parts, ingestion effects and combined effects with organic contaminants. Ingestion of MPs damages living beings and then MPs transfer through food chains. The responses of living beings to MPs are mainly related to sublethal effects at environmental-relevant concentrations. The inhibition of individual growth and reproduction, disturbance of proteins and genes, and reduction of nutrition uptake were reported for specific physiological effects of MPs. Some researches proposed that MPs could be accumulated in living organisms. Therefore, humans, as a part of the food chains, will inevitably be affected by MPs. The organic contaminants combine with the MPs released from the plasticizers in the production of MPs and then are adsorbed in the natural environments. MPs have been found in seafood. As a result, MPs become one medium of human exposure to organic pollutants. The analysis and identification of MPs are critical to other researches, such as environmental behaviors and toxicity. In general, the analytical methods of plastic include physical and chemical characterizations. Physical characterizations involve visual, microscopy and spectroscopy methods. Chemical characterization methods, such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), scanning electron microscope and energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TDS-GC-MS) are frequently used in chemical characterizations. Although lots of analytical methods were proposed by researchers, there are still some shortcomings and limitations, for example, the influence from environmental or biological matrices. It is necessary to develop effective and accurate methods for the analysis of MPs. Through many researches of MPs were reported recently, the information of source, migration, distribution, biological effects and analytical methods of MPs is not enough to scientifically evaluate their environmental and health risks. Consequently, the present review also proposes some perspectives for MPs researches. It is worth to study the distribution of MPs in terrestrial and freshwater environments, the biological effects at individual level, the prevention and control of MPs pollution and the environmental behavior of nanoplastics. Integrating the data of MPs source, distribution, behavior and toxicity is necessary to the scientific evaluations of MPs risks. This review provides insights in the control techniques and theoretical researches of MPs.']"

However, the mismanagement of litter are exacerbating the increasing plastic issue worldwide. In the present study, we sampled discarded PPE in 10 sites along Marina Beach, India. We characterized the litter types by chemical analysis techniques. A total of 1154 COVID-19-associated PPE items were found on Marina beach. The highest number of items were face masks (97.9 %) and the mean PPE density in the sites studied was 4 × 10−3 PPE m−2. The results demonstrate that poor solid waste management and lack of awareness are the main causes of pollution at Marina beach. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that face masks and gloves were principally made of polypropylene and latex, respectively. The FTIR spectra also showed signs of chemical degradation. Our results suggest that plastic pollution is increasing, possibly becoming more impactful to marine biota. Beach management measures were discussed.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic led to a still ongoing international health and sanity crisis. In the current scenario, the actions taken by the national authorities and the public prioritized measures to control the transmission of the virus, such as social distancing, and face mask-wearing. Unfortunately, due to the debilitated waste management systems and incorrect disposal of single-use face masks and other types of personal protective equipment (PPE), the occurrence of these types of items has led to the exacerbation of marine plastic pollution. Although various studies have focused on surveying marine coasts for PPE pollution, studies on inland water are largely lacking. In order to fill this knowledge gap, the present study assessed PPE pollution in the Iranian coast of the Caspian Sea, the largest enclosed inland water body in the world by following standard monitoring procedures. The results concerning the density (1.02 × 10−4 PPE/m2) composition (face masks represented 95.3% of all PPE) of PPE are comparable to previous studies in marine waters. However, a notable decrease in the occurrence of PPE was observed, probably to behavioral and seasonality reasons. The possible consequences of PPE pollution were discussed, although much more research is needed regarding the ecotoxicological aspects of secondary PPE contaminants, such as microplastics and chemical additives. It is expected that face mask mandates will be eventually halted, and PPE will stop being emitted to the environment. However, based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 scenario, several recommendations for coastal solid waste management are provided. These are proposed to serve during and after the pandemic.', 'The ongoing COVID-19 disease significantly affects not only human health, it also affects the wealth of country’ economy and everyday routine of human life. To control the spread of the virus, face mask is used as primary personal protective equipment (PPE). Thus, the production and usage of face masks significantly increase as the COVID-19 pandemic still escalating. Further, most of these masks contain plastics or other derivatives of plastics. Therefore, this extensive usage of face masks generates million tons of plastic wastes to the environments in a short span of time. This study aims to investigate the environmental impact induced by face mask wastes and sustainable solution to reduce this waste. An online survey was carried out to identify the types of face mask and number of masks used per week by an individual from 1033 people. Based on this survey and available literature, this study quantifies the amount of plastics waste generated by face masks. However, this survey was limited with certain ages, country and durations (July–August 2020). Thus, the prediction of plastic waste generation, only provide fundamental knowledge about the mask wastes. Results revealed that there is a huge plastic waste remained in land and marine environment in the form of mask waste, which will contribute to micro-plastic pollution. Therefore, this paper also highlights the sustainable approach to the mask production by integrating the use of natural plant fiber in the woven face mask technology to reduce the plastic waste induced by masks. Further, upcycling the mask waste and producing construction materials also discussed.']"

The majority of microplastic surveys to date consist of single sampling events that do not consider spatiotemporal variability as a potential confounding factor in the interpretation of their results. Therefore, these surveys may not accurately capture or reflect levels of microplastic contamination in the environment. Here, we provide the first investigation of small-scale spatial and temporal variability of microplastic abundance, distribution, and composition in the intertidal zone of an urbanized US estuary to better understand the short-term, daily spatiotemporal variability of microplastics in dynamic coastal environments. Intertidal sediment was collected from both the low and high intertidal zones of a sandy estuarine beach located in South Carolina, southeastern US every 1 to 2 days at low tide over 17 days (12 sampling events; total n = 72). Study-wide, microplastic abundance ranged from 44 to 912 microplastics/m2 and consisted primarily of polyethylene, nylon, polyester, and tire (or tyre) wear particles. High temporal variability was observed, with microplastic abundance differing significantly among sampling events (p = 0.00025), as well as among some consecutive tidal cycles occurring within 12 h of each other (p = 0.007). By contrast, low spatial variability was observed throughout the study with no significant differences in microplastic abundance detected between the low and high intertidal zones (p = 0.76). Of the environmental factors investigated, wind direction on the day of sampling had the greatest effect on temporal microplastic variability. Our results demonstrate that there can be significant temporal variability of microplastic abundance in estuarine intertidal sediments and are important for informing the methods and interpretation of future microplastic surveys in dynamic coastal environments worldwide.', 'Novaes, G.O.; Monteiro, S.M., and Rollnic, M., 2020. Microplastics in the fluvio-estuarine beaches of Cotijuba Island, Pará River estuary (Brazil). In: Malvárez, G. and Navas, F. (eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 780-784. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The coastal environment is constantly affected by materials of anthropogenic origin, among which are microplastics. Microplastics are particles smaller than 5 mm that are derived (or not) from the fragmentation of larger plastics. They are carried by currents and tides and deposited along the shoreline, and are mixed with the sediment. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of microplastics in depth within the sediment of five river-estuarine beaches located in Cotijuba Island, in the Pará River estuary (Brazil): PedraBranca, Vai-Quem-Quer, Flexeira, Farol, and Fazendinha. Sediment samples were collected at the high tide line and at three trenches on each beach, with 0.8 m depth, subdivided in four 0.2 m layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 cm). Microplastics were present on all beaches. A total of 13,007 microplastics were counted, of which 99.6% were fibers. Most of them were transparent (38.34 %) and elongated (98.71 %). PedraBranca was the most contaminated beach, with 20,166.7 ± 13,392 particles m . Concerning depth, mean microplastic density was similar among the layers analyzed (0-20 cm =13,416.7 ± 5,070 particles m ; 20-40 cm =10,510.0 ± 8,707 particles m , 40-60 cm=16,005.0 ± 16,011 particles m ; 60-80 cm=9,566.7 ± 1,838 particles m , Kruskal-Wallis, χ2 = 1.34; p = 0.71) regardless of the beach. On PedraBranca, there were higher densities (33,316.7 particles m ± 14,050) on the surface (0-20 cm), and on Flexeira beach, the density was higher (20,300.0 particles m ± 15,230) in bottom layers (60-80 cm). On the other beaches, the highest densities occurred in the 40-60 cm layer, with 25,125.0 ± 21,460 particles m on Vai-Quem-Quer beach, 18,400.0 ± 4,727 particles m on Farol beach, and 9,816.7 ± 16,011particles m on Fazendinha beach. These results show that Amazon river-estuarine beaches are exposed to microplastic contamination.', 'Sediment samples were collected from nearshore, tributary and beach environments within and surrounding the northern part of Lake Erie, Ontario to determine the concentrations and distribution of microplastics. Following density separation and microscopic analysis of 29 samples, a total of 1178 microplastic particles were identified. Thirteen nearshore samples contained 0–391 microplastic particles per kg dry weight sediment (kg−1), whereas 4 tributary samples contained 10–462 kg−1 and 12 beach samples contained 50–146 kg−1. The highest concentrations of nearshore microplastics were from near the mouths of the Detroit River in the western basin and the Grand River in the eastern basin, reflecting an urban influence. The highest microplastic concentrations in beach samples were determined from Rondeau Beach in the central basin where geomorphology affects plastics concentration. The Welland Canal sample in the eastern basin contained the greatest concentration of microplastics of the tributary samples, which is consistent with high population density and shipping traffic. The overall abundance of microplastic in northern Lake Erie nearshore, tributary and beach samples is 6 times lower than in sediment sampled from northern Lake Ontario. The nearshore and beach sample results potentially reflect the transport patterns of floating plastics modeled for Lake Erie, which predict that the majority of plastic particles entering the lake are transported to southern shoreline regions rather than northern areas.']"

Coral reefs not only serve as one of the most charismatic and biodiverse ecosystems on our planet, but also maintain the human harvesting of natural resources and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. However, the abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in coral reef systems receive little scientific attention. Meanwhile, the impacts of microplastics and nanoplastics on coral health and its potential mechanisms remain further studied. Herein, this review first summarized the current status of microplastics pollution in global coral reefs, especially included (i) abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in different media (e.g., seawater, sediment, corals), and (ii) possible sources of microplastics in reef regions. Furthermore, the main interaction mechanisms between microplastics and corals are highlighted. Following this, the direct or indirect impacts of microplastics on coral species are discussed. With the rapid increase of plastic consumption and background of pervasive global coral bleaching, research on marine microplastics must focus on the critical coral reef regions and include a comprehensive knowledge about the distribution, fate, and potential risks from an ecosystem perspective.', ""Coral reefs are increasingly affected by the consequences of global change such as increasing temperatures or pollution. Lately, microplastics (i.e., fragments < 5 mm) have been identified as another potential threat. While previous studies have assessed short-term effects caused by high concentrations of microplastics, nothing is known about the long-term effects of microplastics under realistic concentrations. Therefore, a microcosm study was conducted and corals of the genera Acropora, Pocillopora, Porites, and Heliopora were exposed to microplastics in a concentration of 200 particles L−1, relating to predicted pollution levels. Coral growth and health, as well as symbiont properties were studied over a period of six months. The exposure caused species-specific effects on coral growth and photosynthetic performance. Signs of compromised health were observed for Acropora and Pocillopora, those taxa that frequently interact with the particles. The results indicate elevated energy demands in the affected species, likely due to physical contact of the corals to the microplastics. The study shows that microplastic pollution can have negative impacts on hermatypic corals. These effects might amplify corals' susceptibility to other stressors, further contributing to community shifts in coral reef assemblages. Microplastics have species-specific impacts on tropical reef-building corals, potentially promoting community shifts in coral reefs."", 'The microplastic pollution has become a worldwide ecological concerns and imposed negative impacts on the coral reef ecosystems. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in the seawater, marine sediment and three scleractinian coral species (Pocillopora damicornis, Galaxea fascicularis, and Porites lutea) at five representative atolls in the Xisha Islands were investigated. The average microplastic abundances in the seawater and marine sediment were 9.5 ± 3.7 particles L−1 and 280.9 ± 231.9 particles kg−1 (dry weight), and the average contents of microplastics in P. damicornis, G. fascicularis and P. lutea were 0.9 ± 0.5 particles cm−2, 1.2 ± 0.6 particles cm−2, and 2.5 ± 1.6 particles cm−2, respectively. There were no significant correlations for the microplastic concentration between the reef environment and the corals. These results infer that the microplastic pollution is severe in the coral reef ecosystem in the Xisha Islands, and scleractinian corals could enrich microplastics from the reef environment. In addition, more than 80% of the microplastics in the seawater, marine sediment and corals were smaller than 2 mm, and the most common types of microplastics were cellophane (61.13%) and polyethylene terephthalate (33.49%). Black and fibers were the most common color and shape of the microplastics in the seawater and marine sediment, respectively. The microplastics in transparent color, film shape and small size (<2 mm) were highly accumulated in corals. Besides, cluster analysis showed that significant difference of microplastic characteristics existed between the corals and the reef environment, and the features of enriched microplastics among three coral species were also different. Moreover, P. lutea exhibited a stronger ability in enriching microplastics than G. fascicularis and P. damicornis. These results suggest that the microplastic-enriching capacities of scleractinian corals are species-specific, and species acclimated to microplastic pollution might become predominant in future coral community.']"

We synthesized life history, environmental, and distributional traits for 103 of these species and compared species with (n = 30) and without (n = 62) known invasion histories. The species represent 12 phyla, and Mollusca, Crustacea, and Bryozoa accounted for 71 of the 103 species. The majority are native to the Northwest Pacific and the Central Indo-Pacific. Species with known invasion history were more common on artificial and hardpan substrates, in temperate reef, fouling, and flotsam habitats, at subtropical and tropical temperatures, and exhibited greater salinity tolerance than species with no prior invasion history. Thirty-five Japanese tsunami marine species without prior invasion history overlapped in ordination trait space with known invaders, indicating a subset of species in this novel assemblage that possess traits similar to species with known invasion history.', 'Forty-nine species of Western Pacific coastal bryozoans were found on 317 objects (originating from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011) that drifted across the North Pacific Ocean and landed in the Hawaiian Islands and North America. The most common species were Scruparia ambigua (d’Orbigny, 1841) and Callaetea sp. Of 36 bryozoans identified to species level, 15 are already known from North America, one of which (Schizoporella japonica Ortmann, 1890) is an earlier introduction from Japan; 18 species are known only from the Western Pacific, one of which (Bugula tsunamiensis McCuller, Carlton and Geller, 2018) is newly described in a companion paper. The 13 additional bryozoans, not taken to species level, are likely derived from the Western Pacific based upon evidence reviewed here; two of these species (Callaetea sp. and Arbocuspis sp.) are undescribed. Seven warm-water species, Metroperiella cf. biformis (Zhang and Liu, 1995), Celleporaria brunnea (Hincks, 1884), Drepanophora cf. gutta Tilbrook, Hayward and Gordon, 2001, Smittoidea spinigera (Liu, 1990), Biflustra grandicella (Canu and Bassler, 1929), Biflustra irregulata (Liu, 1991), and Celleporina cf. globosa Liu, 2001, not known from Japan, may have been acquired by Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris (JTMD) as these objects were carried by ocean currents into more southern waters. Three oceanic bryozoans (Jellyella tuberculata (Bosc, 1802), Jellyella eburnea (Hincks, 1891), and Arbopercula angulata (Levinsen, 1909)) provide insight into the routes that some JTMD items may have taken, and thus the conditions experienced, as they rafted from the Western Pacific to the Central and Eastern Pacific. The cooler-water species J. tuberculata and A. angulata were found primarily on JTMD objects arriving in the Pacific Northwest, whereas J. eburnea was most common on objects landing in the Hawaiian Islands. The most common bryozoan growth forms on these rafted objects were runners (creeping uniserial morphology) and arborescent forms capable of using available surface area provided by other organisms (such as hydroids) on space-limited objects. Species that form flat or mounded encrustations were less frequent, suggesting that they do not fare as well in a potentially space-limited environment.', 'Aim: On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that resulted in the largest known rafting event in recorded history. By spring 2012, marine debris began washing ashore along the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada with a wide range of Asian coastal species attached. We used this unique dataset, where the source region, date of dislodgment and landing location are known, to assess the potential for species invasions by transoceanic rafting on marine debris. Location: Northeast Pacific from 20 to 60°N. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Forty-eight invertebrate and algal species recorded on Japanese tsunami marine debris (JTMD). Methods: We developed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models for 48 species recorded on JTMD to predict establishment potential along the Pacific coast from 20 to 60°N. Models were compared within the context of historical marine introductions from Japan to this region to validate the emergence of marine debris as a novel vector for species transfer. Results: Overall, 27% (13 species) landed with debris at locations with suitable environmental conditions for establishment and survival, indicating that these species may be able to establish new populations or introduce greater genetic diversity to already established non-native populations. A further 21 species have an environmental match to areas where tsunami debris likely landed, but was not extensively sampled. Nearly 100 Japanese marine species previously invaded the northeastern Pacific, demonstrating this region’s environmental suitability for rafting Japanese biota. Historical invasions from Japan are highest in California and largely known from bays and harbours. Main conclusions: Marine debris is a novel and growing vector for non-native species introduction. By utilizing a unique dataset of JTMD species, our predictive models show capacity for new transoceanic invasions and can focus monitoring priorities to detect successful long-distance dispersal across the world’s oceans.']"

25,24,63,24_road_atmospheric_twp_deposition,24: Tire Wear Particles (TWP) as a Source of Microplastic Pollution from Road Dust,"['road', 'atmospheric', 'twp', 'deposition', 'wear', 'dust', 'mps', 'airborne', 'air', 'particles']","['Tire wear particles (TWP) are assumed to be the most dominant source of environmental microplastics (MP). Besides rubber components around 60% of tires are additives such as filling material and various chemicals added for vulcanization. The inevitably released TWP in daily traffic are therefore considered a threat to the ecosystem. Nevertheless, published studies on MP mass loads often exclude elastomers. Data concerning composition and concentrations of TWP compared to prominent “traditional” MP polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(vinyl chloride), are missing. Identification and quantification of TWP was implemented in an existing pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) method for MP determination. An approach to differentiate between car and truck tire wear and to quantify their respective mass loads is presented. Complex environmental samples such as road dust, fresh water and marine sediments, blue mussels, and marine salts were partly retrospectively analyzed using Py-GC/MS. The results showed ratios of car to truck tire wear up to 16 to 1 and underline the dominance of car compared to truck tire wear mass loads in all analyzed samples. Even though some retrospective data sets might be affected by suboptimal density separation conditions (NaBr, ρ = 1.5 g/cm3), TWP concentrations in road dust clearly exceeded those of “traditional” MP (Ø 5 g TWP vs 0.3 g MP per kg road dust (dry weight). Samples included in this study, which were archived further away from TWP sources such as roads, reflected decreasing TWP concentrations (Ø 24 μg TWP vs. 107 μg MP per kg sediment (dry weight); Ø 126 μg TWP vs. 378 μg MP per kg marine salt) or were no longer present (blue mussels), while “traditional” polymers were still ubiquitously distributed.', 'Tire wear particles (TWP) are assumed to be one of the major sources of microplastic pollution to the environment. However, many of the previously published studies are based on theoretical estimations rather than field measurements. To increase the knowledge regarding actual environmental concentrations, samples were collected and analyzed from different matrices in a rural highway environment to characterize and quantify TWP and other traffic-derived non-exhaust particles. The sampled matrices included road dust (from kerb and in-between wheeltracks), runoff (water and sediment), and air. In addition, airborne deposition was determined in a transect with increasing distance from the road. Two sieved size fractions (2–20 µm and 20–125 µm) were analyzed by automated Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) single particle analysis and classified with a machine learning algorithm into the following subclasses: TWP, bitumen wear particles (BiWP), road markings, reflecting glass beads, metals, minerals, and biogenic/organic particles. The relative particle number concentrations (%) showed that the runoff contained the highest proportion of TWP (up to 38 %). The share of TWP in kerb samples tended to be higher than BiWP. However, a seasonal increase of BiWP was observed in coarse (20–125 µm) kerb samples during winter, most likely reflecting studded tire use. The concentration of the particle subclasses within airborne PM80-1 decreases with increasing distance from the road, evidencing road traffic as the main emission source. The results confirm that road dust and the surrounding environment contain traffic-derived microplastics in both size fractions. The finer fraction (2–20 µm) dominated (by mass, volume, and number) in all sample matrices. These particles have a high potential to be transported in water and air far away from the source and can contribute to the inhalable particle fraction (PM10) in air. This highlights the importance of including also finer particle fractions in future investigations.', 'Tyre and road wear is one of the main emission sources of particulate plastics (microplastics). In this study, the emissions of tyre wear particles (TWP) which are annually generated on the German road network were calculated. Emissions are calculated by applying two different data sets of emission factors and the annual mileage for distinct vehicles and road types (urban roads, rural roads, highways). Environmental entry paths of tyre and road wear particles (TRWP) were considered including releases to ambient air, soils and surface waters. Road runoff treatment was taken into account differentiated into sewage systems in urban areas and at non-urban roads. This study identifies the soundest data available concerning emission factors, data on traffic and road systems as well as comprehensive information on road runoff treatment in Germany. Applying this data and assuming that 5% of the total emissions are ‘fine’ air-borne particles, the emissions of coarse ‘non-airborne’ particles are 75,200–98,400 t/a;. the transport to road banks and soils near roads is 57,300–65,400 t/a (66–76%) including runoff and drift; 8700–19,800 t/a (12–20%) are released to surface waters. Due to lack of data, degradation in soils and surface waters was not considered. Besides soils, urban wastewater treatment plants are expected to be an important sink of TRWP assuming that most of the particles are incorporated in the sewage sludge. Due to the application of sewage sludge as a fertilizer, 1400–2800 t/a TWP are currently deposited on agricultural areas. No reliable data was available to estimate the masses of TWP which are transported from freshwaters into the marine environment. Existing mitigation measures should be improved according to the principle of precaution by installation of road runoff treatment systems and retrofitting of existing plants regarding optimum fine particle retention.']"

Despite growing concern about microplastic pollution in freshwater habitats, the literature has not yet addressed effluent-dependent rivers, which derive 100% of their baseflow from effluent. The objective of this study was to document and explore trends in microplastic pollution within the effluent-dependent lower Santa Cruz River near Tucson, Arizona (USA). We examined microplastic concentrations in the water column and benthic sediment and microplastic consumption by mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) at 10 sites along a ~40 km stretch of the lower Santa Cruz River across two time periods: baseflow (effluent only) and post-flood (effluent immediately following urban runoff). In total, across both sampling periods, we detected microplastics in 95% of water column samples, 99% of sediment samples, and 6% of mosquitofish stomachs. Flow status (baseflow vs post-flood) was the only significant predictor of microplastic presence and concentrations in our models. Microplastic fragment concentrations in the water column were higher post-flood, microplastic fiber concentrations in benthic sediment were lower post-flood, and mosquitofish were more likely to have consumed microplastics post-flood than during baseflow. The additional microplastics detected after flooding was likely due to a combination of allochthonous material entering the channel via runoff and bed scour that exhumed microplastics previously buried in the riverbed. Effluent-dependent urban streams are becoming increasingly common; more work is needed to identify microplastic pollution baselines and trends in effluent rivers worldwide.', ""Microplastics are pervasive pollutants in fresh waters, but their distribution, abundance, and diversity in fluvial environments remain poorly documented. Previous research indicated that large polyethylene microbeads were abundant in the freshwater sediments of the St. Lawrence River. Here we extend this work by quantifying the abundance of a broad range of sizes and types of microplastics in sediments and surface water samples, and we relate these metrics to environmental variables. We sampled 21 sites for sediments that spanned a land use gradient, and 10 surface water stations above and below wastewater effluent sites, along the fluvial corridor of the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City from July to August 2017. Microplastics were removed from sediments using an oil extraction protocol and enumerated under fluorescent microscopy. We tested predictions that environmental filters and known point sources affect microplastic concentrations in the river. The mean concentration of microplastics across all sediment sampling sites was 832 (±150 SE) plastics per kg dry weight (range 65–7562 plastics per kg dry weight), which is among the highest recorded (in the top 25%) for the world's freshwater and marine systems. Microplastic concentrations in the sediments were significantly related to a suite of environmental variables including land use and sediment particle characteristics. Particle characteristics, proximity to point sources (urban land use), and environmental filters (sediment compositional variables, % organic carbon, % inorganic carbon and distance from shore) each explained a significant fraction of variation in the microplastic composition in the sediment, with environmental filters having the greatest influence. We present a protocol that could be used to efficiently and accurately detect a broad range of microplastics until a standardized protocol is established for large-scale monitoring."", 'Microplastics are an environmental contaminant of growing concern, but there is a lack of information about microplastic distribution, persistence, availability, and biological uptake in freshwater systems. This is especially true for large river systems like the Colorado River that spans multiple states through mostly rural and agricultural land use. This study characterized the quantity and morphology of microplastics in different environmental compartments in two large reservoirs along the Colorado River: Lakes Mead and Mohave, within Lake Mead National Recreation Area. To assess microplastic occurrence, surface water and surficial sediment were sampled at a total of nine locations. Sampling locations targeted different sub-basins with varying levels of anthropogenic impact. Las Vegas Wash, a tributary which delivers treated wastewater to Lake Mead, was also sampled. A sediment core (33 cm long, representing approximately 19 years) was extracted from Las Vegas Bay to assess changes in microplastic deposition over time. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were sampled at a subset of locations to assess biological uptake of microplastics. Microplastic concentrations were 0.44–9.7 particles/cubic meter at the water surface and 87.5–1,010 particles/kilogram dry weight (kg dw) at the sediment surface. Sediment core concentrations were 220–2,040 particles/kg dw, with no clear increasing or decreasing trend over time. Shellfish microplastic concentrations ranged from 2.7–105 particles/organism, and fish concentrations ranged from 0–19 particles/organism. Fibers were the most abundant particle type found in all sample types. Although sample numbers are small, microplastic concentrations appear to be higher in areas of greater anthropogenic impact. Results from this study improve our understanding of the occurrence and biological uptake of microplastics in Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and help fill existing knowledge gaps on microplastics in freshwater environments in the southwestern U.S.']"

At two locations in San Diego Bay, we measured sorption of PAHs to PS pellets, sampling at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. We detected 25 PAHs using a new analytical method with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Several congeners were detected on samples before deployment. After deployment, some concentrations decreased (1,3-dimethylnaphthalene and 2,6-methylnaphthalene), while most increased [2-methylanthracene and all parent PAHs (PPAHs), except fluorene and fluoranthene], suggesting that PS debris is a source and sink for PAHs. When sorbed concentrations of PPAHs on PS are compared to the five most common polymers [polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP)], PS sorbed greater concentrations than PP, PET, and PVC, similar to HDPE and LDPE. Most strikingly, at 0 months, PPAHs on PS ranged from 8 to 200 times greater than on PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE, and PP. The combination of greater PAHs in virgin pellets and large sorption suggests that PS may pose a greater risk of exposure to PAHs upon ingestion. © 2013 American Chemical Society.', ""Plastic is a wonder product, perhaps one of humanity's best innovations, and has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. Besides the indisputable benefits of plastic materials, significant concerns arise about plastic leakage to the environment. Tiny plastic particles, so-called microplastics (MP), have been detected ubiquitously in various ecosystems around the globe. They are bioavailable for many organisms and may negatively affect ecosystems and society, and the economy. The present study was conducted at first to understand the nature, behavior, and interactions of microscopic plastic waste in the marine environment.A preliminary study was conducted in the coastal environment from the Andaman Sea to map the current plastic pollution status and establish baseline data MPs in water, sediment, and marine food web. In this work, clear evidence of MP bioaccumulation was observed in the marine food-chain organisms like zooplankton, finfishes, and shellfishes. A high amount of MP retention was observed in the zooplankton community. Maximum MP ingestion was observed in adult carangid fish Carangoides malabaricus (up to 67 micro-particles/fish). FT-IR revealed many anthropogenic polymers like polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, acrylic, and ionomer surlyn. These results depict that plastic pollution is ubiquitous and reached almost every compartment of the coastal environments.Further, to understand the plastic pollution hotspots in the Indian marine environments, a comparative study was carried out to assess the abundances and characteristics of MPs in the bottom sediments from the continental shelf zone of the Andaman Sea and the Arabian Sea. Surface sediments were collected onboard FORV Sagar Sampada from 14 locations of the Andaman Sea and 8 locations of the Arabian Sea with a depth varied from 76 to 264 m. Microplastics were isolated using density separation methods and were enumerated using light microscopy and epi-fluorescence microscopy. MP concentration ranged from not detected (ND) to 267 particles per kilogram. Mean MP concentration at the Arabian Sea was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the Andaman Sea. Among different types of MPs, fiber had the highest distribution, followed by fragment and pellet. The mean MP concentration at the Arabian Sea was significantly higher than the Andaman Sea, suggesting the Arabian Sea experiences more anthropogenic pressures than the former area.The present study revealed the widespread occurrence of MPs throughout the Indian seas. Further, to understand the ecological consequences of these microscopic litters, MP ingestion by oceanic zooplankton of the Arabian Sea was analyzed. Clear evidence of higher amounts of MP ingestion was observed in carnivorous zooplankton than in the herbivorous or omnivorous species. These results suggest that feeding habits play critical roles in the pollutants' availability in the marine environment. The plastic pollution problem is magnifying due to the long-term persistence and prolonged degradation of plastics in the environment. Omnipresent accumulation, persistence, and environmental toxicity of plastic waste warrant immediate action for developing efficient, eco-friendly, and sustainable technologies for their degradation. However, some of the microbes, including bacteria, are capable of synthetic polymer degradation.To understand whether microbes can play a critical role in solving the plastic pollution, 11 marine bacteria with plastic degradation potentials were isolated from the coastal environments of Andaman Island. Further, based on the preliminary screening, a bacterial consortium was prepared with four bacterial strains from the genus Vibrio (2 strains), Paenibacillus, and Bacillus. The bacterial consortium was incubated with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sheets as sole carbon source and incubated for 120 days. After 120 days of incubation on average, nearly 47% LDPE degradation was observed. These observations were supported with FT-IR, SEM, AFM, NMR, and TG-DSC analysis. These results suggest that the bacterial consortia used in this work may have great potential to degrade plastics and solve the problem. However, further research is required to develop innovative, cutting-edge, and eco-friendly technology to solve plastic pollution."", 'Concerns regarding marine plastic pollution and its affinity for chemical pollutants led us to quantify relationships between different types of mass-produced plastic and organic contaminants in an urban bay. At five locations in San Diego Bay, CA, we measured sorption of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) throughout a 12-month period to the five most common types of mass-produced plastic: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP). During this long-term field experiment, sorption rates and concentrations of PCBs and PAHs varied significantly among plastic types and among locations. Our data suggest that for PAHs and PCBs, PET and PVC reach equilibrium in the marine environment much faster than HDPE, LDPE, and PP. Most importantly, concentrations of PAHs and PCBs sorbed to HDPE, LDPE, and PP were consistently much greater than concentrations sorbed to PET and PVC. These data imply that products made from HDPE, LDPE, and PP pose a greater risk than products made from PET and PVC of concentrating these hazardous chemicals onto fragmented plastic debris ingested by marine animals. © 2012 American Chemical Society.']"

However, the quantity of microplastics (MPs) in sediments is imperative for an overall understanding of worldwide MPs pollution. To address the above-mentioned gap, this study was performed on 43 seabed sediment stations from the Marmara Sea of Turkey. Studied stations vary between marine (MRN), pier (PIER), stream (STR), sea discharge (SD), and deep-sea discharge (DSD) stations. Collected seabed sediment samples were analyzed for MPs abundance, shape, size and color distribution. Besides, an investigation on the effect of sea depth on MPs' total abundance, size, and shape was investigated using Pearson's and Spearman's product momentum correlation coefficient. Empirical data analysis showed that the highest MPs abundance at STR stations changed between 1956.5 ± 3031.8 and 3256.2 ± 5168.2 particle/kg (dry weight: d.w.) for small MPs particles (SMP) and large MPs particles (LMP), respectively. Contrarily, the lowest abundance was found as 224.8 ± 423.05 and 287.68 ± 218.6 particle/kg (d.w.) for SMP and LMP fractions, respectively at DSD stations. The MPs abundance were found at 5 categorized stations in the following order; STR>PIER>MRN>SD>DSD, noted that the highest MPs quantity was found at STR-6 station located in Golden Horn. The isolated MPs were predominantly filament and fragment in shape (42.34 ± 6.10% and 33.91 ± 6.92%), blue and white in color (40.46 ± 4.66% and 24.75 ± 3.83%). Mean MPs abundance was determined to be 1957.37 ± 4079.96 particle/kg (d.w) at all 43 stations and sizes between 1 and 5 mm was found to be predominant at depths between 5 and 71m. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between sea depth and parameters such as total MPs abundance, shape, and size. The overall results revealed the widespread presence of MPs in the seas surrounding Istanbul."", 'Purpose: Plastic pollution in the world has led to an abundance of microplastics (MPs) and has been identified as a potential factor that can lead to serious environmental problems, especially in oceans and seas. Information on the current status of MPs pollution along the Montenegrin coast is insufficiently investigated. This study monitors the abundance, distribution, and sources of MPs, and identifies present polymers in the surface sediment of the Montenegrin coast, as well as comparison with previous research. Materials and methods: Ten sampling sites along the Montenegrin coast were selected to collect surface sediment samples. The upper layer of sediment (0–5\xa0cm) was collected by a Petite ponar grab. The samples were dried, and density separation was performed using a NaCl solution. The abundance and morphological characteristics of MPs were determined using an optical microscope (DP-Soft software), while FT-IR analysis was done to identify the polymer type. Results and discussion: Microplastics were identified in all sediment samples with an average abundance of 307 ± 133 (SD) MPs/kg in dry sediment. The highest abundance of MPs was found in locations in the vicinity of highly populated areas, near wastewater discharges, and areas with high fishing and tourist activities. The most dominant shape types of MPs in all samples were filaments and fragments. The most common colors of MPs were blue and red, while the dominant MPs sizes were 0.1–0.5\xa0mm and 0.5–1.0\xa0mm. Of the eight identified polymers, PP, PE, and PET were the most common. Conclusion: This study reveals MPs characteristics (abundance, distribution, shape type, colors, size, polymers type) in surface sediment along the Montenegrin coast, as well as the most significant sources of MPs pollution, and provides important data for further research on MPs to identify the effects of MPs pollution on the quality, health, and functionality of the marine environment.', 'Microplastics (MPs; particles <5 mm) are widely distributed in various habitats from the land to the oceans. They have even reached the remotest of places, including the deep seas and Polar Regions. Although research on MPs pollution in the marine environment has received widespread attention in recent years, the distribution, sources and ecological risks of MPs in coastal areas remain unclear. This study assessed the abundance, characteristics, sources and ecological risk of MPs in surface waters and sediment of the mainland coast and four island groups comprising the coral reef environment of the Gulf of Mannar (GoM), southeast India. Mean MPs abundance across all 95 sampling sites ranged from 28.4 to 126.6 items L−1 in water and from 31.4 to 137.6 items kg−1 in sediment. MP fibers <2 mm dominated the water, while fragments >3 mm were predominant in sediments. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were the most common polymers in both matrices. The major proportion of MPs in the GoM derived from land-based sources, with distance to the mainland, coastal population density and improper handling of solid waste being the main factors influencing the abundance of MPs. Polymer Hazard Index (PHI), Pollution Load Index (PLI) and Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI) were used to assess current levels of MPs. While the GoM has high PHI values (>1000) resulting from MPs with high hazard scores (e.g. polyamide, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride), the PLI values (1.46 and 1.51) indicate low MPs pollution levels in GoM waters and sediments, and the PERI values (31.7 and 24.4) indicate that this represents a minor ecological risk. The results from the current study enhance our understanding of the characteristics, sources, and associated environmental risks of MPs to marine ecosystems. This data may provide a baseline for future monitoring and the formulation of environmental policy.']"

Microplastic contamination was found in more than half of the analysed fish. Ingested microplastics were classified by type, colour and length with most of the particles consisting of filaments (<5 mm). Longer filaments were more frequently ingested in the upper estuary and smaller filaments in the lower estuary, as a result of differences in hydrodynamic forces and proximity to the probable input sources. The river is likely an important source of filaments to the estuary and filaments ingested in the upper estuary showed little sign of weathering, when compared with those from the lower estuary, which are subject to intense weathering and consequent break-up of particles to smaller sizes. Most filaments, of all colours, accumulated in adults of C. acoupa, which are more susceptible to contamination through both direct ingestion and trophic transference as they shift their feeding mode to piscivory. Moreover, the highest ingestion of filaments in adults occurred in the lower estuary, during the late rainy season, likely associated with the intense fishing activities in this habitat, which results in a greater input of filaments from fishing gear, which are mainly blue in colour. Overall, 44% of the ingested filaments were blue, 20% purple, 13% black, 10% red and 12% white. The next most common colour, the purple filaments, are most likely blue filaments whose colour has weathered to purple. Red filaments were proportionally more ingested in the lower estuary, indicating a coastal/oceanic source. White and black filaments were more commonly ingested in the inner estuary, suggesting that they have a riverine origin and/or were actively ingested by juveniles and sub-adults, which inhabit the inner estuary and have zooplankton as an important food resource. Environmental gradients and ecological interactions are responsible for the patterns of ingestion of the different colours and lengths of filaments by Cynoscion acoupa.', 'This study provides a pilot investigation of the relationship between microplastic ingestion and the trophic ecology of three pelagic fish species (Engraulis encrasicolus, Scomber scombrus, and Trachurus trachurus) from Anzio coast, Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Stable isotope analysis has been performed to determine the trophic position and the isotopic niche of the three species. Then, data on the occurrence, abundance, and diversity of ingested microplastics have been analyzed considering the observed foraging patterns. The detected differences in the estimated trophic position (E. encrasicolus = 3.08 ± 0.18; S. scombrus = 3.57 ± 0.21; T. trachurus = 4.07 ± 0.21), together with the absence of overlap in the isotopic niches confirm that the three examined species cover different ecological roles within the coastal-pelagic food web. Results from the analysis of ingested microplastics show that the trophic position has no remarkable effects on the incidence of microplastic ingestion, with no significant differences detected in terms of both frequency of occurrence and number of ingested microplastics per individual. However, differences among species emerge when considering the diversity of ingested microplastic types in terms of shape, size, color, and polymer composition. Species at higher trophic levels have shown to ingest a greater diversity of microplastics, including a significant increase in the size of the ingested particles (median surface area: 0.011 mm2 in E. encrasicolus; 0.021 mm2 in S. scombrus; 0.036 mm2 in T. trachurus). The ingestion of larger microplastics might be due to the larger gape sizes but also to active selection mechanisms, likely stimulated by the similarity of these particles to natural or potential prey of both S. scombrus and T. trachurus. Overall, this study suggests that microplastic ingestion can be affected by the different trophic position of fish species, providing new insights about the impact of microplastic contamination on the pelagic community.', 'The distribution, feeding ecology and microplastic contamination were assessed in different ontogenetic phases of Haemulidae species inhabiting the Goiana Estuary, over a seasonal cycle. Pomadasys ramosus and Haemulopsis corvinaeformis are estuarine dependent species that use habitats with specific environmental conditions each season. Pomadasys ramosus was found in the upper and middle estuaries during the rainy season, when salinity showed the lowest values. Haemulopsis corvinaeformis was found in the lower estuary during the dry season, when salinity increased in the estuary. Juveniles of P. ramosus are zooplanktivores, feeding mainly on calanoid copepods. Sub-adults and adults are zoobenthivores, feeding on invertebrates associated to the bottom, mainly Polychaeta. Juveniles of H. corvinaeformis were not found in the main channel, but sub-adults and adults showed a zoobenthivore habit, feeding mainly on Anomalocardia flexuosa (Mollusca: Bivalvia). Dietary shifts along the life cycle and the spatio-temporal relationship between their distribution and the availability of microplastics along the estuary seem to have a strong influence in the ingestion of microfilaments. The highest average ingestion of microfilaments by P. ramosus coincided with the peak of ingestion of Polychaeta by sub-adults in the upper estuary during the late rainy season. For H. corvinaeformis the highest ingestion of microfilaments coincided with the peak of ingestion of A. flexuosa by adults in the lower estuary during the late dry season. Such contamination might be attributed to the time when these phases shifted to a more diverse diet and began to forage on benthic invertebrates. Research on microplastic contamination must consider species-specific behaviour, since the intake of microplastics is dependent on patterns of distribution and trophic guild within fish assemblages. Contamination of Pomadasys ramosus and Haemulopsis corvinaeformis with microplastics depends on the relationship between the seasonal use of estuarine habitats and dietary shifts along life cycle.']"

The Salish Sea experiences seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, river discharge, sewage overflow events, and tourism—all variables previously thought to have an impact on microparticle transport and concentrations. Our goals are two-fold: 1) describe long-term microparticle contamination data including concentration, type, and size; and 2) determine if seasonal microparticle concentrations are dependent on environmental or tourism variables in Elliott Bay, Salish Sea. We sampled 100 L of seawater at a depth of approximately 9 m at the Seattle Aquarium, Seattle, Washington State, United States, approximately every two weeks from 2019 through 2020 and used an oil extraction protocol to separate microparticles. We found that microparticle concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.64 particles L−1 and fibers were the most common type observed. Microparticle concentrations exhibited a breakpoint on 10 April 2020, where estimated slope and associated microparticle concentration significantly declined. Further, when considering both environmental as well as tourism variables, temporal microparticle concentration was best described by a mixed-effects model, with tourism as the fixed effect and the person counting microparticles as the random effect. Although monitoring efforts presented set out to identify effects of seasonality and interannual differences in microparticle concentrations, it instead captured an effect of decreased tourism due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Long-term monitoring is critical to establish temporal microparticle concentrations and to help researchers understand if there are certain events, both seasonal and sporadic (e.g., rain events, tourism, or global pandemics), when the marine environment is more at risk from anthropogenic pollution.

This paper systematically summarizes the research progress on microplastics pollution and its ecological effects in the coastal environment around the world during the past ten years. There remain some key technical points that need to be solved urgently to study mircroplastics pollution, including highly efficient and accurate separation and identification methods and reliable source identification techniques and models. Future hot topics in this field of study are likely to include: the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in the coastal environment based on hydrodynamic models of ocean currents and tides; binding and release mechanisms of toxic pollutants with respect to the surface characteristics of microplastics; and methodology and databases for ecotoxicology and human health assessment of pollution with microplastics alone and in combination with toxic pollutants. Future research on microplastics pollution in the coastal environment will thus be subject to the integration of the international occurrence of plastics pollution and the development of key techniques to study the status of microplastics pollution in the coastal environment. On this basis prospective studies may focus on investigation of and monitoring of microplastics in the coastal environment, the combined occurrence of microplastics with other emerging pollutants, the transfer and bioaccumulation of microplastics and their combined pollutants among the different trophic levels, and the management of microplastics pollution. All these topics will contribute to filling the knowledge gap in mircroplastics pollution and promote the development of appropriate regulatory mechanisms.', ""Microplastics pollution is an issue of great concern for scientists, governmental bodies, ecological organisations, and the general public. Microplastics pollution is widespread and is a great environmental problem on account of its potential toxicity for marine biota and human health. Today, almost all the world's seas and oceans are polluted with microplastics. The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed reservoir of brackish water and is a hotspot for contamination in terms of eutrophication and the presence of organic matter. Microplastics are quite intense, based on data from studies of marine litter and microplastics in the Baltic Sea. The number of microplastics in the Baltic Sea water is 0.07–3300 particles/m3, and in sediments 0–10179 particles/kg. These amounts prove that the waters and sediments of the Baltic Sea are heavily contaminated with microplastics. This article provides a comprehensive review of the microplastic origins and transport routes to the Baltic Sea. The data is presented as the concentration of microplastics in surface waters, sediments, and sea sand. The extraction methods used and the microplastics techniques are also presented. The possibilities and limitations of water and sediment sampling methods for microplastics determination were summarised, taking into account sampling tools, volume and depth. Extraction, separation, filtration, and visual sorting are outlined as sample preparation techniques for microplastic analysis. This review also focuses on the problems of obtaining data relevant to the development of the mathematical models necessary to monitor trends in the spread of microplastics in the Baltic Sea. Finally, several important laws and policies, which are in place in the Baltic States to control and manage microplastic pollution in the region, are highlighted.""]"

In order to realize the simultaneous measurement of the temperature and pressure in seawater, a reflective optical fiber sensor based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-sealed optical microfiber coupler combined with a sagnac loop (OMCSL) is proposed. Benefiting from the high thermo-optical coefficient and large elasticity of PDMS, and the large-scale swift field transmission characteristics of optical microfiber coupler (OMC), the sensitivity and structural stability of our sensor is largely improved. The response performance of the sensor is further analyzed by numerical simulation calculations and theoretical modeling. Experimental results show that the temperature and pressure sensitivity of the sensor could reach -2.133 nm/°C and 3.416 nm/Mpa, respectively, about one order higher than that of bare fiber OMCSL. Furthermore, via inversely calculating the cross-sensitivity matrix, the temperature and pressure sensing can be demodulated simultaneously, and the average errors of the preliminary experimental settlements are 1.61% and 5.02%, respectively. Due to the merits of compact structure, easy fabrication, high sensitivity, fast response speed and high stability, the basic performance of this dual parametric sensor is comparable to the existing electrical temperature-depth (TD) sensor, which is expected to meet the practical application requirements of marine environmental monitoring and ocean dynamics research.', 'Based on the polymer encapsulation method, a compact structure and high-sensitivity temperature and pressure dual parametric sensor was developed in this paper by wrapping an optical microfiber coupler (OMC) in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Benefiting from the stable chemical properties and good optical field control ability of PDMS, the sensor showed good stability and repeatability. The dependence of the sensor sensitivity on wavelength, temperature, and pressure was experimentally investigated. The results showed that the temperature and pressure sensitivity could reach −2.283 nm/°C and 3.301 nm/Mpa in the C-band range. To overcome the cross-sensitivity of sensor temperature and pressure, a sensitivity matrix was established to realize dual-parameter simultaneous demodulation. In addition, the pressure repeatability of the sensor was tested. Based on this, the sensitivity matrix was further calibrated to reduce the error and improve the accuracy of demodulation. Finally, we also designed a protective shell for the sensor to meet the requirements of practical marine applications. Compared with other existing types of optical fiber sensors, this sensor has the advantages of simple fabrication, high sensitivity, and environmental adaptability, and has great potential for application in the field of marine environmental monitoring.', 'An all-fiber hybrid structure Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based on silica fiber and fluorinated polyimide microfiber (FPMF) for temperature or salinity sensing in seawater is proposed. Theoretically, transmission characteristic and sensing sensitivity of the MZI are derived for this kind of hybrid structure, and typical interference spectrum is observed around optical communication band. Experimentally, by tracking the shift of interference peaks, temperature and salinity sensing are demonstrated with sensitivities of about 140 pm/°C and 64 pm/‰ respectively, which are much higher than those of existing fiber Bragg gratings and microfiber knot resonators. In addition, dependences of sensitivity on sensor parameters, such as fiber diameter and fiber lengths, are also investigated. Unlike the other microfiber based sensors that higher sensitivity usually comes from the thinner fiber, sensors demonstrated here show that sensitivities can be tuned by changing the path-length difference of the two arms, which greatly decreases the difficulty in component fabrications. Temperature or salinity sensor demonstrated here show advantages of simple fabrication, low cost, tunable sensitivity and dynamic range, relatively high sensitivity and compatible with standard fiber optics system, which may have potential applications in developing low cost and compact size optical sensors in ocean or other liquid surroundings.']"

However, in regions, such as the west coast of Scotland, sparse populations, combined with complex coastlines of numerous islands, sea lochs and headlands, has resulted in limited field data. The Clyde Sea is the most populated and industrialised region on the west coast of Scotland and therefore a potential source of land-based plastic litter to the less populated coast to the north. This study first presents an analysis of Marine Conservation Society (MCS) citizen-science beach-clean data, from 1994 to 2019, revealing spatial patterns between beach-clean sites. Plastic litter was categorised into land, marine and unknown sources, with the most common items in these three categories being crisp packets, fishing rope and fragments, respectively. On the west coast of Scotland there is on average 380.3 ± 419.9 plastic items per 100\xa0m of coast, with the site average number of items recovered ranging from 1–2,355 per 100\xa0m of coast. To simulate marine plastic litter movement from the Clyde Sea to a defined northwest model sub-area, an unstructured-grid hydrodynamic model was coupled with a particle tracking model subject to currents, diffusion, and wind. Three coastal boundary conditions were used to compare transport paths with or without particle beach resuspension, and for the resuspending cases, with or without a distinction between coastal type (retentive beaches versus reflective rocky coasts). Of the total released particles, the percentage that beached within the model sub-area, after a 1-year model run, ranged between 45.7% and 88.3% depending on the coastal boundary condition. The Clyde Sea was found to be a potential source of beached land-based plastic litter to the north, as on average, 6.8% (range: 2.9%–11.7%) of particles exited the Clyde Sea, crossed a defined northern boundary, and beached on the northwest coast. Both hydrodynamic and particle tracking models were tested, and the varying boundary conditions were compared to investigate holistic methodologies to better understand plastic pollution.', 'The increased global production of plastics has been mirrored by greater accumulations of plastic litter in marine environments worldwide. Global plastic litter estimates based on field observations account only for 1% of the total volumes of plastic assumed to enter the marine ecosystem from land, raising again the question ‘Where is all the plastic? ’. Scant information exists on temporal trends on litter transport and litter accumulation on the deep seafloor. Here, we present the results of photographic time-series surveys indicating a strong increase in marine litter over the period of 2002–2014 at two stations of the HAUSGARTEN observatory in the Arctic (2500 m depth). Plastic accounted for the highest proportion (47%) of litter recorded at HAUSGARTEN for the whole study period. When the most southern station was considered separately, the proportion of plastic items was even higher (65%). Increasing quantities of small plastics raise concerns about fragmentation and future microplastic contamination. Analysis of litter types and sizes indicate temporal and spatial differences in the transport pathways to the deep sea for different categories of litter. Litter densities were positively correlated with the counts of ship entering harbour at Longyearbyen, the number of active fishing vessels and extent of summer sea ice. Sea ice may act as a transport vehicle for entrained litter, being released during periods of melting. The receding sea ice coverage associated with global change has opened hitherto largely inaccessible environments to humans and the impacts of tourism, industrial activities including shipping and fisheries, all of which are potential sources of marine litter.', 'Anthropogenic litter is a ubiquitous stressor in the global ocean, and poses ominous threats to oceanic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At the terrestrial-ocean interface, tropical mangrove forests are subject to substantial exposure to mismanaged litter from inland and marine sources. While the effects of litter in different marine ecosystems are well-documented, research on the ecological consequences of litter pollution on mangroves remain nascent stage. Here, we investigated anthropogenic litter concentration, composition, probable sources, and impact on coastal mangroves along the Central West coast of India. The mean concentration of trapped litter was measured 8.5 ± 1.9 items/m2 (ranged 1.4 ̶ 26.9 items/m2), and 10.6 ± 0.5 items/tree (ranged 0 ̶ 85 items/tree) on the mangrove floor and mangrove canopy, respectively. Plastic dominated 83.02 % of all litter deposited on the mangrove forest floor and 93.4 % of all entangled litter on mangrove canopy. Most litter comprised single-use plastic products across all surveyed locations. Mangrove floor cleanliness was assessed using several indices, such as Clean Coast Index, General Index, Hazardous Items Index, and Pollution Load Index, reiterating an inferior cleanliness status. The pollution load index indicates “Hazard level I"" plastic pollution risk across the mangroves. Litter concentration differed markedly across all sites. However, a significantly higher concentration of stranded litter was detected in the densely populated urban agglomeration and rural areas with inadequate solid waste management. Probable sources of litter indicate land-based (local) and sea-originated (fishing). Supportive information on the transport and accumulation of marine litter is examined based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS) model version 2 reanalysis of surface wind and current pattern across the Arabian Sea followed by MIKE simulated tide-induced coastal current. Mangrove pneumatophores and branches were found to be damaged by entangled plastics. Hence, determining litter quantum and their probable input source is pivotal in mitigating anthropogenic litter impact on mangrove ecosystems and fostering mangrove conservation. Overall, results envisage that stringent enforcement, implementation of an integrated solid waste management framework, and general behavioral change of the public are crucial to mitigate litter/plastic pollution.']"

The abundance and characteristics of microplastics in the sediments (and ragworms within the sediments) were then determined to identify the source of microplastics in ragworms, and to explore the effects of ragworms on microplastics in sediment. The average abundance of microplastics in tidal flat sediments was (0.49±0.17) n•g-1, which was at a high level in domestic offshore environmental studies. Among all the microplastics detected, the most common form and color were fiber and black-gray, respectively, and the materials were mainly polyethylene (PE), polyester (PET), and polystyrene (PS). The detection rate of microplastics in ragworm was 77.78%-86.67%, with an average abundance of (6.68±2.21) n•ind-1; the abundance was significantly correlated with individual mass (r=0.42, P=0.002). The microplastic abundance was significantly higher in ragworms with individual mass over 1.5 g than in those with a mass of< 0.5 g or 0.5-1 g (F3=141.029, P=0.000). In ragworms, microplastics were dominated by small black or blue fibers, and the main materials were PE and PET. By analyzing the various characteristics of microplastics with a particle size of 0-3 mm, it was found that the abundance of microplastics in sediments was strongly correlated with that in ragworms (r=0.79, P=0.01); the main form (r=0.90, P=0.035) and the material composition (r=0.73, P=0.024) also showed significant correlation between sediments and ragworms. This indicates that ragworms ingest microplastics in the sedimentary environment and exchange the microplastics with the sediments. Therefore, ragworms can be used as an indicator species of microplastic pollution in sediments.', 'Occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in freshwater environments, particularly reservoir and lakes, is an emerging concern. There are limited studies in Pakistan on microplastic pollution in the lacustrine environments and those that exist do not provide sufficient information on the spatial distribution of MPs in offshore surface water. The aims of this study were to determine microplastic abundance in Rawal Lake, Pakistan and to ascertain if sampling methodology influences microplastic counts. Surface water samples were collected from 10 sites; 5 tributaries, 2 human settlement and 3 fishing and boating areas using two different sampling techniques: 100 μm mesh trawl and 20 L sample through a 45 μm mesh sieve. A significant difference was observed in the abundance of MPs across two methods with the sieve method yielding 2.8 ± 1.44 particles/L and trawl yielding 0.025 ± 0.024 particles/L. Tributaries and boating/fishing area had higher microplastic abundance than the residential area regardless of sampling method. Filaments were the dominant shape of MPs in both type of samples followed by fragments in trawl samples and films in sieved samples. Microbeads were only detected in trawl samples. MPs within size range 0.1–0.9 mm were mostly fragments (82%). MPs were diverse in colors with white/transparent and black MPs common. Polypropylene was the main type of microplastic in Rawal Lake (40–74%). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of MPs showed cracks, roughness and striations on the particles. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detected heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Co and Cr) in MPs. Findings suggest that microplastic pollution in Rawal Lake may pose great risk to aquatic and human life through leaching of inherent/adsorbed heavy metals and therefore requires future investigation.', ""Microplastics (MPs) have been reported as an emerging xenobiotic organic pollutant in freshwater ecosystems and a universal hazard for ecosystems because of the rapid increase in global demand. The present study was conducted to explore MPs' occurrence, abundance and spatial distribution in sediment, water and Schizothorax plagiostomus samples, collected from the Swat River. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used for chemical characterization of visually identified MPs by using standard protocols such as digestion using H2O2, density separation using ZnCl2, vacuum filtration with borosilicate glass micro filter papers and digital microscopy using a stereomicroscope connected with a camera. Range of mass abundance of identified MPs in river sediments, river water, tributaries sediment and tributary water was found to be 0.6-2.5 mg kg−1, 0.7-3.8 mg L−1, 0.9-4.5 mg kg−1 and 0.6-1.1 mg L−1 respectively. Meanwhile, in Schizothorax plagiostomus digestive tracts samples, it was 0.6-1.9 mg per fish. Numeric abundance of MPs in all matrices was found to be tributary sediment (202 items per kg) > river water (192 items per L) > river sediment (182 items per kg) > fish (153 items per fish) > tributary water (92 items per L). MPs identified on the basis of morphology in all matrices were found to be fragments > fibers > pellets > films > foams. MPs were dominant in all urban stations while their spatial distribution along with the study site was heterogeneous due to the surroundings such as tourist spots, hydrodynamic conditions, and proximity to urban areas, plastic industries and due to recharge by the highly contaminated tributaries. The MPs identified on the basis of size dimensions show that S1 (0.5-1 mm) in all matrices was highest while S2 (1-5 mm) was the lowest. Primary source MPs identified were fibers, films, fragments and foams particles while secondary sources were pellets. Results of ATR-FTIR showed that PE was the most common plastic type identified in all samples followed by PVC, PET, PP and PS. This is the first study exploring the MPs' occurrence, numeric and mass abundance and spatial distribution in the SR ecosystem. The present study may be a valuable reference for better understanding the MPs' pollution in Pakistan. The findings of the present study can help to identify the potential sources (i.e., primary and secondary) of MPs to improve waste management in the Swat District and model the transport fluxes of these microplastics in other rivers using water quality parameters and basin characteristics.""]"

Growing evidences demonstrate that the health of the ocean and the health of humans have always been and will continue to be, inextricably linked. Our actions toward the oceans will significantly influence the future of the whole planet and, in turn, our own health. The current review of these issues arose from a summer school in San Sebastian (Spain), from 5th to 7th June, 2019. An interdisciplinary group of researchers discussed key risks (e.g., microbial pollution, pharmaceuticals, harmful algal blooms, plastic pollution) and benefits (e.g., bathing waters, recreation, tourism) of the seas and global ocean for humanity; and debated the future priorities and potential actions for a joint Oceans and Human Health research and governance programme in Europe. The aim of this review is to contribute to the emerging scientific agenda on ocean health and human health, as well as coordinate efforts with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public. This agenda operates within the larger context of the upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development: 2021–2030, which strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including healthy (human) lives and well-being (SDG3) and conserving and sustainably using the oceans (SDG14), among others. In addition to summarizing some of the key risks and benefits, therefore, we describe the governance of oceans and health interactions (especially in Europe), and we finish by proposing a list of elements for potential future research priorities on oceans and human health.', ""The Ocean Data Platform project was initiated initiated since 2020 to support our aspiration to become the guardian of the Ocean. PTTEP ('the Company') aspires to take part in providing of marine science data around our offshore operation to the general public, as there is currently no offshore information available from Thailand. The data will be beneficial to ocean scientists, authorities, and could lead to the development of various ocean conservation programs and prediction model. This Ocean Data Platform is designed to collect the up-to-date and real-time offshore ocean health and biodiversity data in Gulf of Thailand (GoT) by leveraging our offshore location strengths, knowledge, and innovative technologies. To establish the real-time offshore data in our operation, met-ocean monitoring station and underwater camera are installed to automatically perform oceanographic measurements to identify biodiversity, species, and aquatic life. This platform will connect our offshore data with other nearshore and midshore data from other entities. They also have alert function to detect abnormal activity so they can investigate and notify relevant parties to take action if necessary. The Ocean Data Platform will be published to stakeholders and interested parties for further research through the websie (reference 4). This platform comprises of 3 main parts of oceanographic monitoring, Ocean for life initiatives and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) events such as offshore microplastic monitoring, underwater biodiversity around offshore platform, coral bleaching baseline, the His Thai Majesty's Ship (H.T.M.S) underwater learning site. This information allows us to mornitor the state of the ocean health in various aspects and analyze the causes of various phenomena such as, impact of greenhouse gases on the ocean, change in ocean water temperature, wave height in monsoon season, ocean acidity, and base of ocean water, etc. We could also use this information to design offshore facilities to optimize CAPEX costs in the future. In addition, this platform is also regarded as the starting point for consolidating all marine-related information into one platform to support Thailand ocean conservation program. This is the first development in Thailand that integrates offshore data with others to complete ocean data in a holistic manner and allows researchers interested in the ocean to effectively use this type of data in their research."", 'Background: Pollution – unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity – is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources – coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children’s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals – phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste – can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South – environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth’s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.']"

Due to the high primary production and complex hydrodynamic conditions in mangroves, MPs are extensively intercepted in various ways while flowing through mangroves, leading to a long-standing but fiercely increasing MPs accumulation. However, current researches mainly focused on the occurrence, source and fate of MPs pollution in mangroves, ignoring the role of mangrove forests in the interception of MPs. Our study firstly demonstrates that mangrove ecosystems have significantly greater MPs interception capacity than their surrounding environments. Then, the current status of studies related to the interception of MPs in mangrove ecosystems is comprehensively reviewed, with the main focus on the interception process and mechanisms. At last, the most pressing shortcomings of current research are highlighted regarding the intercepted flux, interception mechanisms, retention time and ecological risks of MPs in mangrove ecosystems and the relevant future perspectives are provided. This review is expected to emphasize the critical role of mangrove forests in the interception of MPs and provide the foundational knowledge for evaluating the MPs interception effect of mangrove forests globally.', 'Microplastic pollution is common in marine and coastal ecosystems, especially in mangrove wetlands. However, factors affecting the distribution of microplastics, such as plants, have not been sufficiently studied. We investigated the effect of different plant species on the distribution of sediment microplastics in two Nature Reserves in South China, viz. Futian Mangrove and Mai Po Mangrove. In Futian Mangrove, the abundance of total microplastics among three monospecific mangrove stands dominated by Sonneratia caseolaris, Kandelia obovata, and Sonneratia apetala was similar. The abundance of microplastics in the mudflat was similar to that in the forest interior, except for the fact that more fiber was found in the mudflat than in the interior of Sonneratia apetala. This suggested that the dense pneumatophores at the fringe prevented fibers from entering the mangrove forest. The significant positive dependence (p < 0.05) between the density of Sonneratia pneumatophores and the abundance of fibers highlighted the importance of pneumatophores. The abundance of total microplastics, predominantly in the form of fibers, in sediments at the forest fringe (2835 ± 713 items/kg d.w. and 2070 ± 224 items/kg d.w. in Futian and Mai Po, respectively) was higher than that in the forest interior and mudflat. There was no difference between the two latter locations in both mangroves, which demonstrated the significance of the fringe effect. This paper reports for the first time that the spatial distribution of microplastics in mangrove sediments was affected by plant species, which provides useful information for environmental processes of microplastics in coastal wetlands.', 'Mangroves are considered to be a sink for microplastics (MPs) due to their unique characteristics. Previous studies mainly focused on the spatial distribution of MPs, but few researchers have addressed the influence of tidal variation on this distribution, especially since the MP total number in mangroves was unknown. In this study, surface sediment samples were collected in mangroves from the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea, and the abundance, composition, and number of MPs were investigated. The results showed that MPs were widely present in all mangrove sediment samples, with abundances ranging from 26.67 ± 9.43 to 239.94 ± 37.80 items/kg. The distribution of MPs was heterogeneous among different sampling sites, with the highest levels in the Shankou (SK) area. The MP abundance in the same mangrove forest gradually increased from the low tidal zone to the high tidal zone, with the enrichment factor ranging from 1.50 to 4.00. The MP abundance was significantly correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC) (n = 12, R = 0.664, p < 0.05). Results showed that mangroves had an interception effect on MPs and factors affecting MP distribution in mangrove sediments included not only tides but also human activities, such as aquaculture, agriculture, and residential life. Finally, this paper estimated the MP total number in mangroves at different sampling areas and tidal zones, and the middle tidal zone was considered to be more accurate for MP pollution assessment in mangroves.']"

Pellets also represent a carrier for both organic and metallic contaminants through their adsorption to the modified plastic surface. In the present study, we examine the adsorption of trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb) to both virgin and beached (aged) pellets under estuarine conditions in order to better understand the role of plastic materials on the transport and behaviour of metals from river to ocean. Metals added to river water and sea water adsorbed to both pellet types with isotherms defined by either the Langmuir or Freundlich model. With increasing pH in river water, adsorption of Cd, Co, Ni and Pb increased, adsorption of Cr decreased and adsorption of Cu was relatively invariant. Along a salinity gradient, created by mixing river and sea waters in different proportions, adsorption of Cd, Co and Ni decreased, adsorption of Cr increased and adsorption of Cu and Pb exhibited a minimum towards the fresh water end-member. In all experiments and for all metals, adsorption was considerably greater to beached pellets than to virgin pellets, presumably because of the weathering of and adsorption and attrition of charged minerals by the former. Speciation considerations suggest that adsorption to the pellet surface largely involves metal cations or oxyanions (e.g. HCrO4- and CrO42-), although additional forms of Cu and Pb (e.g. organic complexes) may also be involved. Despite mass-normalised adsorption constants being lower than equivalent values defining the adsorption of metals to sediments, microplastics should be regarded as a component of the suspended load of estuaries whose precise role on contaminant transport requires further study.', 'The pollution and adverse effects of microplastics in the marine environment have been widely reported. However, the information on the transfer of chemical additives from microplastics to the environment or organisms is quite limited. This study investigated the release of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) from expanded polystyrene (EPS) microplastics in seawater and digestive fluids. The results showed that both the particle size of EPS microplastics and environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, and pH) play crucial roles in the release of HBCDs. The release rates of ΣHBCD (sum of α-, β- and γ-HBCD) from EPS microplastics in seawater ranged from 8.64 to 33.3 ng·g-1·d-1 under different conditions. Compared with the seawater control, a slight but not significant increase in the release of HBCDs was observed in the digestive fluids. The diastereoisomer profiles of HBCDs released from EPS microplastics both in seawater and digestive fluids were similar. The proportions of α-HBCD and β-HBCD released from EPS in seawater and digestive fluids were higher than those in the original EPS microplastics, especially for β-HBCD. The diffusion model explained the release data of HBCDs from EPS microplastics apparently better than the other two models, suggesting that the diffusion within the matrix of microplastic is a rate-limiting step. Based on the mass of EPS microplastics and release rates of HBCDs, the annual release of HBCDs from EPS microplastics into the global ocean was estimated to be 9.29 to 115 kg. These HBCDs would have profound impacts on marine organisms and even endanger human health and safety. Considering the abundance of microplastics in the ocean, the release of chemical additives from microplastics deserves more attention in the future.', 'Expanded polystyrene (EPS) microplastics (MPs) have become a major component of plastic debris both on land and in marine systems globally. However, the accumulation and speciation distribution of heavy metals on EPS MPs and their potential hazards to marine organisms are still unknown. In this study, a 12-month field experiment investigating EPS exposure to seawater was conducted, and concentrations and speciation of six heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and Ni) on the EPS MPs were studied along with an evaluation of their ecological risks. Results showed that the accumulation of heavy metals on the EPS MPs increased over the exposure time, which conformed to a pseudo first-order kinetic equation. Speciation analysis suggested that Cu, Zn, Cd, and Ni principally distributed in the acid soluble fraction, while Pb and As primarily existed in the reducible fraction. There were significant correlations among the reducible fraction, the oxidizable fraction, the residual fraction, and the carbonyl index (p < 0.05). Compared with heavy metals in sediments, the migration and bioavailability of heavy metals on the aged EPS MPs were higher. By comprehensively considering the accumulation amount, chemical speciation and toxicity, the risk levels of heavy metals on the EPS MPs were in the decreasing orders of Cd > Pb > As > Ni > Cu > Zn. The ecological risk of heavy metals on the EPS MPs increased over the exposure time, and Cd, Pb, As, and Ni were the primary contributing factors. Our study results will be helpful for better understanding the ecological risk level of heavy metals on MPs, and will provide a reference for further research on the ecological toxicity of MPs.']"

Phthalates and phthalate esters are commonly added to consumer goods to enhance desirable properties. As the amount of plastic marine debris increases, these chemicals can easily leach from these products into the surrounding environment. To evaluate demographic variability in exposure, eight phthalate metabolites were quantified in urine samples collected from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins sampled in Sarasota Bay, FL, USA (2010–2019; n\xa0=\xa051). Approximately 75% of individual dolphins had detectable concentrations of at least one phthalate metabolite. The most frequently detected metabolites were mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP; n\xa0=\xa028; GM\xa0=\xa04.57\xa0ng/mL; 95% CI\xa0=\xa02.37–8.80; KM mean\xa0=\xa07.95; s.d.\xa0=\xa015.88) and monoethyl phthalate (MEP; GM\xa0=\xa04.51\xa0ng/mL; 95% CI\xa0=\xa02.77–7.34; ROS mean\xa0=\xa02.24; s.d.\xa0=\xa05.58).

Additionally, there were no significant group differences in the likelihood of MEHP or MEP detection for any demographic as determined by a Peto-Peto test. Frequency of detection was similar for both metabolites between males and females (MEHP p\xa0=\xa00.10; MEP p\xa0=\xa00.40) as well as between juveniles and adults (MEHP p\xa0=\xa00.50; MEP: p\xa0=\xa00.60). These findings suggest ubiquitous exposure risk for both sexes and age classes, warranting further investigation into potential sources and health implications.', 'Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are classified as endocrine disruptors, but it remains unclear if they can enter the marine food-web and result in severe health effects for organisms. Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) can be chronically exposed to PAEs by ingesting plastic debris, but no information is available about PAEs levels in blood, and how these concentrations are related to diet during different life stages. This paper investigated, for the first time, six PAEs in blood of 18 wild-caught Mediterranean loggerhead turtles throughout solid-phase extraction coupled with gas chromatography-ion trap/mass spectrometry. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen were also performed to assess the resource use pattern of loggerhead turtles. DEHP (12–63 ng mL-1) and DBP (6–57 ng mL-1) were the most frequently represented PAEs, followed by DiBP, DMP, DEP and DOP. The total PAEs concentration was highest in three turtles (124–260 ng mL-1) whereas three other turtles had concentrations below the detection limit. PAEs were clustered in three groups according to concentration in all samples: DEHP in the first group, DBP, DEP, and DiBP in the second group, and DOP and DMP in the third group. The total phthalates concentration did not differ between large-sized (96.3 ± 86.0 ng mL-1) and small-sized (67.1 ± 34.2 ng mL-1) turtles (p < 0.001). However, DMP and DEP were found only in large-sized turtles and DiBP and DBP had higher concentrations in large-sized turtles. On the other hand, DEHP and DOP were found in both small- and large-sized turtles with similar concentrations, i.e. ~ 21.0/32.0 ng mL-1 and ~ 7.1/9.9 ng mL-1, respectively. Winsored robust models indicated that δ13C is a good predictor for DBP and DiBP concentrations (significant Akaike Information criterion weight, AICwt). Our results indicate that blood is a good matrix to evaluate acute exposure to PAEs in marine turtles. Moreover, this approach is here suggested as a useful tool to explain the internal dose of PAEs in term of dietary habits (δ13C), suggesting that all marine species at high trophic levels may be particularly exposed to PAEs, despite their different dietary habitats and levels of exposure.', 'Phthalates are chemical esters used as additives in common consumer goods, such as plastics, household cleaners, and personal care products. Phthalates are not chemically bound to the items to which they are added and can easily leach into the surrounding environment. Anthropogenic drivers, such as coastal plastic pollution and wastewater runoff, increase the exposure potential for coastal marine fauna. Phthalate exposure in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins has been the focus of recent study, with indications of heightened exposure to certain phthalate compounds. The objective of this study was to compare urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations among bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in Sarasota Bay, FL, to levels reported in human samples collected as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) were the most prevalent metabolites detected in dolphin urine (n = 51; MEP = 29.41%; MEHP = 54.90%). The geometric mean (GM) concentration of MEP was significantly lower for dolphins (GM = 4.51 ng/mL; 95% CI: 2.77–7.34 ng/mL) compared to humans (p<0.05), while dolphin concentrations of MEHP (GM = 4.57 ng/mL; 95% CI: 2.37–8.80 ng/mL) were significantly higher than levels reported in NHANES (p<0.05). Health impacts to bottlenose dolphins resulting from elevated exposure to the MEHP parent compound (diethyl-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, DEHP) are currently unknown. However, given the evidence of endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment, and abnormal development in humans, pursuing investigations of potential health effects in exposed bottlenose dolphins would be warranted.']"

This study was conducted to investigate the macroplastic litter and determine the clean-coast index (CCI) of the residential and non-residential sites on the coasts of Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Plastic litters were sampled from 21 coastal barangays by delineating a 50-m-long transect line with three 4 m × 4 m quadrats. The litter sampled were counted and sorted into categories. The results showed that 17 sites were contaminated with plastic litters. In terms of residential and non-residential sites, the east coast has thrice as much plastic, 2.61 items/m2 and 1.26 items/m2 compared to west coast with only 1.57 items/m2 and 0.14 items/m2, respectively. The plastics sampled were predominantly fishing line (nylon), food packaging, and fragments. The calculated CCI revealed that 76% of the sites sampled were categorized as dirty and extremely dirty.', 'The Philippines is identified as one of the major marine plastic litter polluters in the world with a discharge of approximately 0.75 million tons of marine plastic debris per year. However, the extent of the plastic problem is yet to be defined systematically because of limited research. Thus, this study aims to quantify plastic litter occurrence in mangrove areas as they function as sinks for plastic litter due to their inherent nature of trapping plastics. To define the extent of marine plastic pollution on an island scale, mangrove areas in 14 municipalities around Cebu Island were sampled, with 3 to 9 transects in each site depending on the length of coastline covered by mangroves. Sampling and characterization of both plastics and the mangrove ecosystem was performed in three locations along the transect – landward, middle, and seaward. A total of 4501 plastic items were sampled throughout the study sites with an average of 1.29 ± 0.67 items/m2 (18.07 ± 8.79 g/m2). The average distribution of plastic loads were 2.68 ± 1.9 items/m2 (38.52 ± 25.35 g/m2), 0.27 ± 0.10 items/m2 (6.65 ± 4.67 g/m2), and 0.94 ± 0.61 items/m2 (9.04 ± 4.28 g/m2) for the landward, middle, and seaward locations, respectively. The most frequent plastic types found were i) packaging, ii) plastic bags and iii) plastic fragments. The plastic loads and types suggest that most plastic wastes trapped in mangroves come from the nearby communities. Fishing-related plastics originated from the sea and were transported across the mangrove breadth. The findings confirm that mangroves are major traps of plastic litter that might adversely affect the marine ecosystem. The study underscores the urgent need for waste mitigation measures, including education, community engagement, infrastructure, technological solutions and supporting policies.', 'Plastic pollution is an arising problem of our generation. Tons of plastics are globally produced affecting different coastal ecosystems. Plastics pile and end up in coastal areas, at the ocean surface, and in the coastal seabed. Almost 70% of plastics made are known to eventually sink in water, and it is suspected that ever-increasing amounts of plastics are accumulating in seabed sediments. However, there are limited studies on macroplastics in coastal seabeds in the different coastal ecosystems in the Philippines. This study aims to determine the prevalence, types, and density of macroplastic litters in the coastal seabed of Sultan Naga Dimaporo (SND), Lanao del Norte. A 100-m transect line with four quadrats measuring 5 m x 5 m, was delineated parallel to the seabed at the beaches of Barangay Pikalawag, Dabliston, Koreo and Sugod. Results revealed that all four sites were contaminated with plastic litter in which 55% were from Pikalawag, a residential area, 16% from Dabliston, a mangrove area, 15% from Sugod, a beach/tourism area, and 14% from Koreo, a non-residential area. The plastic density was 1.32 items/m2 for Pikalawag, and 0.32 to 0.37 items/m2 for the other areas. The waste collected was primarily food packaging (17%), plastic fragments (16%), and plastic bags (11%). The highest polymer type was LDPE (40%) followed by both multilayers (13%) and PET (13%). Based on the clean coast-index, Pikalawag can be categorized as extremely dirty while the other three sites were moderately clean. Overall, this study showed how the prevalence and composition of plastic litter vary in different coastal seabeds in SND, Lanao del Norte.']"

The present study is based on the hypothesis that commercial sea salts can act as an indicator of MP pollution in the surrounding environment unless the MPs are filtered out during the manufacturing process. A total of 39 different salt brands produced at geospatially different sites, including 28 sea salt brands from 16 countries/regions on six continents, were investigated. A wide range of MP content (in number of MPs per kg of salt; n/kg) was found: 0-1674 n/kg (excluding one outlier of 13 629 n/kg) in sea salts, 0-148 n/kg in rock salt, and 28-462 n/kg in lake salt. Relatively high MP content was identified in sea salts produced in Asian countries/regions. The abundance of MPs in unrefined sea salts (n = 25) exhibited significant linear correlations with plastic emissions from worldwide rivers (r 2 = 0.33; p = 0.003) and with the MP pollution levels in surrounding seawater (r 2 = 0.46; p = 0.021) in the published literature. The results indicate that not only is Asia a hot spot of global plastic pollution, as previous studies have suggested, but also that sea salt can be a good indicator of the magnitude of MP pollution in the surrounding marine environment.', 'This is the first study which assessed the microplastic contamination of sea salt products from Viet Nam. The results obtained from 9 iodate fine table sea salt and 4 raw sea salt samples collected from different salt production regions along Viet Nam showed that microplastics were present in 9/9 of the salt samples. The mean abundance of microplastics was 878 ± 101 items/kg and 340 ± 26 items/kg for raw and fine sea salts, respectively. For both raw and fine sea salts, fibers were the predominant type of microplastics, accounting for more than 60% of total microplastic particles. In addition, three types of polymer were detected in 12 microplastic particles by FTIR, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), among which, the most common is PE (accounting for 67%). The results, gathered from this research, evidence the microplastic contamination within Vietnamese sea salt, and thus, become crucial to develop more future research, leading to a better understanding of the risks associated with salt consumption as well as measures to reduce microplastic contamination in sea salt.', 'Aim: In this study, the microplastic (MP) concentration in several brands of salts was investigated. Materials and Methods: Fifteen samples of crystallized salt, refined sea salt, unrefined sea salt, and rock salt were purchased from local markets and analyzed for MPs concentration. The salts were digested with the Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation method first, and the MPs were floated based on density difference. Then, MPs were counted by scanning electron microscopy and nature was confirmed by using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Results: The MP concentrations in crystallized salt, refined sea salt, unrefined sea salt, and rock salt were 151.4 ± 48.8, 406.7 ± 93.3, 1417.4 ± 203.3, and 283.4 ± 97.0 MPs/kg, respectively. The most abundant polymers were polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The fiber was the dominant shape of MPs in all salt samples. Conclusions: This study reveals the presence of MPs in crystallized salt, refined sea salt, unrefined sea salt, and rock salt. Therefore, the consumption of salts can expose humans to MPs.']"
