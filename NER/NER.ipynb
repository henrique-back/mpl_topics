       "[The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, marking one of the most catastrophic global health crises of the 21st century. Throughout this period, widespread use and improper disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) emerged as a pressing environmental issue, significantly impacting various life forms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a high rate of PEP disposal. An alarming 1.6 × 106 tons of plastic waste each day has been generated since the onset of the outbreak, predominantly from the inadequate disposal of PPE. The mismanagement and subsequent degradation of discarded PPE significantly contribute to increased non-biodegradable micro(nano)plastic (MNP) waste. This pollution has had profound adverse effects on terrestrial, marine, and aquatic ecosystems, which have been extensively of concern recently. Accumulated MNPs within aquatic organisms could serve as a potential route for human exposure when consuming seafood. This review presents a novel aspect concerning the pollution caused by MNPs, particularly remarking on their role during the pandemic and their detrimental effects on human health. These microplastic particles, through the process of fragmentation, transform into nanoparticles, persisting in the environment and posing potential hazards. The prevalence of MNP from PPE, notably masks, raises concerns about their plausible health risks, warranting global attention and comprehensive exploration. Conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the long-term effects of these processes and implementing effective management strategies is essential. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), the emerging contaminants of the present century, are potentially a major threat to human health and ecology. There is currently no comparison of the properties of MPs in indoor and outdoor air. Thus, there is a need a systematic review (SR). The goals of this study were to answer the following questions: (1) what are the geographical distribution, sources, abundances, and characteristics (polymer, type, shape, color, size) of MPs in outdoor and indoor air? (2) What are the limitations of the published studies and recommendations for future research? To achieve these objectives, four electronic databases were searched to find works published before December 31, 2022. In total, 37 publications were selected based on the PRISMA guidelines. The study found that polyester and polyethylene terephthalate were the most dominant polymer types in outdoor and indoor environments, respectively. The most important indoor sources for MPs included synthetic textiles, kitchen plastic utensils, synthetic fiber carpets, detergents, and furniture, while the most important sources for outdoor MPs include industrial emissions, particulate emissions from vehicles, burning of plastic waste, the expulsion of air bubbles and wave action in ocean and decomposition and destruction of plastic materials. Fibers were the dominant shape of airborne MPs in both environments. The predominant colors of the MPs in samples of the indoor air were white and transparent, whereas black was most abundant in the microplastic samples collected from the air outside the building. Finally, given the ubiquitous nature of MPs and their potential for adverse effects, governments should take effective measures to reduce the production of plastic materials and finally increase plastics reuse, and recycling rate. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Natural depressions on continental margins termed minibasins trap turbidity currents, a class of sediment-laden seafloor density driven flow. These currents are the primary downslope vectors for clastic sediment, particulate organic carbon, and microplastics. Here, we establish a method that facilitates long-distance self-suspension of dilute sediment-laden flows, enabling study of turbidity currents with appropriately scaled natural topography. We show that flow dynamics in three-dimensional minibasins are dominated by circulation cell structures. While fluid rotation is mainly along a horizontal plane, inwards spiraling flow results in strong upwelling jets that reduce the ability of minibasins to trap particulate organic carbon, microplastics, and fine-grained clastic sediment. Circulation cells are the prime mechanism for distributing particulates in minibasins and set the geometry of deposits, which are often intricate and below the resolution of geophysical surveys. Fluid and sediment are delivered to circulation cells by turbidity currents that runup the distal wall of minibasins. The magnitude of runup increases with the discharge rate of currents entering minibasins, which influences the amount of sediment that is either trapped in minibasins or spills to downslope environs and determines the height that deposits onlap against minibasin walls. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Foraminifera are single-celled protists which are important mediators of the marine carbon cycle. In our study, we explored the potential impact of polystyrene (PS) microplastic particles on two symbiont-bearing large benthic foraminifera species—Heterostegina depressa and Amphistegina lobifera—over a period of three weeks, employing three different approaches: investigating (1) stable isotope (SI) incorporation—via 13C- and 15N-labelled substrates—of the foraminifera to assess their metabolic activity, (2) photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic diatoms using imaging PAM fluorometry, and (3) microscopic enumeration of accumulation of PS microplastic particles inside the foraminiferal test. The active feeder A. lobifera incorporated significantly more PS particles inside the cytoplasm than the non-feeding H. depressa, the latter accumulating the beads on the test surface. Photosynthetic area of the symbionts tended to decrease in the presence of microplastic particles in both species, suggesting that the foraminiferal host cells started to digest their diatom symbionts. Compared to the control, the presence of microplastic particles lead to reduced SI uptake in A. lobifera, which indicates inhibition of inorganic carbon and nitrogen assimilation. Competition for particulate food uptake was demonstrated between algae and microplastic particles of similar size. Based on our results, both species seem to be sensitive to microplastic pollution, with non-feeding H. depressa being more strongly affected. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The characterization of microplastic (MP) contamination in marine species is increasing as concerns about environmental and food safety are more and more discussed. Here, we reported a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the contamination by anthropogenic particles (from visual sorting; AP) and MP (plastic-made) in the whole soft body or digestive tract of marine species. Four commercial species were studied, namely the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), the spiny spider crab (Maja sp.), the common sole (Solea solea) and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax or punctatus). AP and MP uptake were studied over three to four seasons depending on the species. After tissues digestion, particles were extracted under a stereomicroscope and morphometric characteristics were reported. Then, polymers were identified by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Seasonal variations were mainly described in the Pacific oyster as AP uptake was lower in autumn and MP uptake was higher in spring. These variations may be linked to the reproduction and growth cycles of this species. Moreover, seabass ingestion was lower in autumn compared to winter. Contamination in spider crabs and soles showed either weak or no seasonal trends, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Overall, AP contamination in all studied species ranged from 1.17 ± 1.89 AP.ind−1 (in sole) to 4.07 ± 6.69 AP.ind−1 (in seabass) while MP contamination ranged from 0.10 ± 0.37 MP.ind−1 (in sole) to 1.09 ± 3.06 MP.ind−1 (in spider crab). Fibers were mostly reported in all species (at least 77.7%), along with cellulosic polymers (at least 43.7%). AP and MP uptake were detected in all species and at almost all seasons, with the only exception of the common sole during autumn. Therefore, this study emphasizes the ubiquity of AP and MP contamination in marine species and provides new knowledges about seasonal uptake by commercial species. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is a significant global environmental issue, and impacts span from individual organisms to the entire ecosystems. This study investigated the properties of microplastics in amphibian larvae, shedding light on their environmental interactions and potential ecological consequences. We examined microplastics extracted from amphibian larvae of 10 taxa, sampled from sites experiencing different levels of human impact. Our findings revealed a predominance of blue microplastics and fibres, each comprising 53% of the total microplastics in amphibian larvae. Microplastic fibres were also notably longer than other morphological types of microplastics. Furthermore, we observed variations in the surface area of microplastics among different amphibian families. An interesting observation from our research is the apparent positive relationship between the size of amphibian larvae and the length of granular and flake-shaped microplastics. Conversely, we observed a negative relationship between the length of these microplastics and human environmental impact. These insights significantly contribute to the understanding of microplastic pollution in freshwater environments, highlighting its complexities beyond marine ecosystems. Our research emphasises the intricate relationships between microplastics and freshwater organisms, underscoring the need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate microplastic pollution. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic overproduction and the resulting increase in consumption has made plastic pollution ubiquitous in all ecosystems. Recognizing this, the United Nations (UN) has started negotiations to establish a global treaty to end plastic pollution, especially in the marine environment. The basis of the treaty has been formulated in terms of turning off the tap, signaling the will to prevent plastic pollution at its source. Based on the distribution of plastic production by sector, the plastic packaging sector consumes the most plastic. The volume and variety of chemicals used in plastic packaging, most of which is single-use, is a major concern. Single-use plastics including packaging is one of the most dominant sources of plastic pollution. Plastic waste causes pollution in water, air and soil by releasing harmful chemicals into the environment and can also lead to exposure through contamination of food with micro- and nano-plastic particles and chemicals through packaging. Marine life and humans alike face risks from plastic uptake through bioaccumulation and biomagnification. While the contribution of plastics ingested to chemical pollution is relatively minor in comparison to other pathways of exposure, the effect of plastic waste on marine life and human consumption of seafood is beyond question. To reduce the long-term impact of plastic, it is crucial to establish a global legally binding instrument to ensure the implementation of upstream rather than downstream solutions. This will help to mitigate the impact of both chemicals and microplastics, including from packaging, on the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " East Java's mangrove ecosystems are exceptionally susceptible to contamination by anthropogenic activities and degradable marine debris, including plastic. This study aimed to investigate the shapes and distribution of microplastics (MPs) in sediment, water, and wild crabs, as well as the correlation. Wild crabs, sediment, and water originated from ten distinct mangrove ecosystems dispersed throughout northern and southern East Java. The MPs were extracted using digestion and density separation methods. The research identified six discrete shapes of MPs in sediment and water: fiber, fragment, foam, film, pellet, and microbead. The identified MPs were distributed in varying concentrations across various sites. Fibers were prevalent in the majority of water, ranging from 2.5 to 24.90 particles. L−1, with the exception of Gedangan (GD) and Dubibir (DB), whose proportion was relatively low. For the sediments, the seven sites contained a greater proportion of fragments ranging from 1.53 to 1.69 particles. g−1 dw as compared to surface waters. Additionally, each wild crab contained 48 particles identified in the gills and digestive tracts (GIT). Fiber constituted more than 60 % of the total MPs, making it the most prevalent shape in the wild crabs. However, this variety was not preferred. Correlation analysis revealed connections between MPs found in sediment and their presence in crab gills and GIT (p < 0.01). This highlights the potential hazards of biomagnification in East Java's mangrove ecosystems. Factor analysis revealed the influential factors that contribute to pollution in the marine protected areas, emphasizing the intricate nature of coastal contamination. This work enhances comprehension of the distribution and consequences of MPs in mangrove ecosystems, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive efforts to mitigate their effects. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The presence of microplastics (MPs) has been reported in ecosystems in the most different regions of the world and rivers have been identified as one of the main means of transporting this debris to oceans. Recent research shows microplastic deposition and accumulation in the Amazon Basin and, despite being scarce, microplastic pollution is ubiquitous in the region. Of the 9 countries that make up the Amazon Basin, only Brazil, Guyana, Ecuador and Peru have published on the topic, with the main focus on biota (58 %). Several Amazon regions such as Northern Amazon in the Far North of Brazil still have no evidence of microplastic pollution with published data. MP abundance ranges from 5 to 74,500 MPs m−3 for waters, 0 to 8178 MPs kg−1 for sediment and 0.34 to 38.3 MPs individual−1 for biota, with nanoplastic scale (<100 μm) in the sediment. Blue and colorless are the predominant colors, mainly from secondary sources (fibers and fragments). The most commonly found polymers are polyamide, polyethyleneterephthalate and polypropylene. Microplastic abundance in aquatic systems is higher than that found in other rivers, such as the Guayas in Ecuador, the Magdalena, in Colombia and the Surabaya in Indonesia and are similar to regions with intense anthropogenic activity such as the Guanabara Bay – Brazil and the Yellow River in China. The precarious basic sanitation structure, urban planning, waste management, combined with the extensive network of navigable waters, are aggravating factors for the increase in plastic pollution in the region. It is necessary to increase research investment on the topic, considering MP quantification, impacts and the relationship with the hydrosedimentological dynamics of the Amazon Basin. The creation and enforcement of laws that minimize the accumulation of these materials is emerging, besides the development of the bioeconomy and sustainable proposals to minimize plastic pollution in the Amazon. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Streams and tributaries can play a significant role in the transport of inland microplastics to rivers and oceans; however, research on microplastics in these water bodies is limited compared to riverine and marine environments. Analyzing microplastic abundance at higher spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial to comprehend the dynamics of microplastics in these water bodies. Therefore, this study investigated year-round spatiotemporal variations of microplastics monthly in surface waters and sediments along the Jungnang Stream, one of the main tributaries to the Han River in South Korea. The mean concentration of microplastics in the stream was 9.8 ± 7.9 particles L−1 in water and 3640 ± 1620 particles kg−1 in sediment. Microplastic concentrations in surface waters during summer were significantly higher than in other seasons, positively linked to increased precipitation and river discharges. Polymer compositions mainly consisted of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, with the majority of microplastics detected smaller than 200 μm. Fragment-shaped microplastics were predominant over fibrous ones. The estimated annual input and output of microplastics through surface waters were 1.2–207 kg (2.7–150 billion particles) and 11.3–272 kg (17–769 billion particles), with the summer months contributing more than 70% of the total output. The greater microplastics output in the Jungnang Stream's waters compared to its receiving waters (Han River) indicates microplastics transport from water to other environmental compartments, such as sediments. These findings highlight the importance of investigating microplastic abundances in surface waters and sediments with temporal resolution, at least across different seasons. Such investigations offer valuable insights into the spatiotemporal occurrence and dynamic transport of microplastics, providing essential information for water management and the development of policies in freshwater ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Background: Microbial functioning on marine plastic surfaces has been poorly documented, especially within cold climates where temperature likely impacts microbial activity and the presence of hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms. To date, only two studies have used metaproteomics to unravel microbial genotype–phenotype linkages in the marine ‘plastisphere’, and these have revealed the dominance of photosynthetic microorganisms within warm climates. Advancing the functional representation of the marine plastisphere is vital for the development of specific databases cataloging the functional diversity of the associated microorganisms and their peptide and protein sequences, to fuel biotechnological discoveries. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment for plastisphere metaproteomics, using multi-omics and data mining on thin plastic biofilms to provide unique insights into plastisphere metabolism. Our robust experimental design assessed DNA/protein co-extraction and cell lysis strategies, proteomics workflows, and diverse protein search databases, to resolve the active plastisphere taxa and their expressed functions from an understudied cold environment. Results: For the first time, we demonstrate the predominance and activity of hydrocarbonoclastic genera (Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas) within a primarily heterotrophic plastisphere. Correspondingly, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism were the dominant pathways expressed. Quorum sensing and toxin-associated proteins of Streptomyces were indicative of inter-community interactions. Stress response proteins expressed by Psychrobacter, Planococcus, and Pseudoalteromonas and proteins mediating xenobiotics degradation in Psychrobacter and Pseudoalteromonas suggested phenotypic adaptations to the toxic chemical microenvironment of the plastisphere. Interestingly, a targeted search strategy identified plastic biodegradation enzymes, including polyamidase, hydrolase, and depolymerase, expressed by rare taxa. The expression of virulence factors and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance suggested pathogenic genera were active, despite representing a minor component of the plastisphere community. Conclusion: Our study addresses a critical gap in understanding the functioning of the marine plastisphere, contributing new insights into the function and ecology of an emerging and important microbial niche. Our comprehensive multi-omics and comparative metaproteomics experimental design enhances biological interpretations to provide new perspectives on microorganisms of potential biotechnological significance beyond biodegradation and to improve the assessment of the risks associated with microorganisms colonizing marine plastic pollution.

       " Although Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods assess a wide range of environmental impacts, ecological impacts of plastic pollution are not commonly included. Here, characterization factors of Polypropylene (PP), Low density polyethylene (LDPE) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) microplastics were assessed. Fate was assessed through the multimedia fate model Simplebox4Plastics. Ecological effects were based on species sensitivity distributions. Macroplastic impacts were included though a conversion fraction. The characterization factors were included in ReCipe2016 method and applied to two consumer packaging films to show the relevance of including plastic pollution in LCAs. Plastic losses were assessed using material flow analysis. The freshwater and marine ecotoxicity midpoint indicators were dominated by plastic pollution impacts, whilst these impacts were limited on ecosystem quality as endpoint. Extending this methodology to additional polymers and additional methodological developments will help to obtain a more complete picture of plastic pollution in LCA and to identify effective mitigation options. © 2024,\n",
       " Mercury is a hazardous heavy metal that is distributed worldwide in aquatic ecosystems. Methylmercury (MeHg) poses significant toxicity risks to aquatic organisms, primarily through bioaccumulation and biomagnification, due to its strong affinity for protein thiol groups, which results in negative effects even at low concentrations. MeHg exposure can cause various physiological changes, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, metabolic disorders, genetic damage, and immunotoxicity. To assess the risks of MeHg contamination in actual aquatic ecosystems, it is important to understand how MeHg interacts with environmental factors such as temperature, pH, dissolved organic matter, salinity, and other pollutants such as microplastics and organic compounds. Complex environmental conditions can cause potential toxicity, such as synergistic, antagonistic, and unchanged effects, of MeHg in aquatic organisms. This review focuses on demonstrating the toxic effects of single MeHg exposure and the interactive relationships between MeHg and surrounding environmental factors or pollutants on aquatic organisms. Our review also recommends further research on biological and molecular responses in aquatic organisms to better understand the potential toxicity of combinational exposure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Airborne microplastics (MPs) are important pollutants that have been present in the environment for many years and are characterized by their universality, persistence, and potential toxicity. This study investigated the effects of terrestrial and marine transport of MPs in the atmosphere of a coastal city and compared the difference between daytime and nighttime. Laser direct infrared imaging (LDIR) and polarized light microscopy were used to characterize the physical and chemical properties of MPs, including number concentration, chemical types, shape, and size. Backward trajectories were used to distinguish the air masses from marine and terrestrial transport. Twenty chemical types were detected by LDIR, with rubber (16.7%) and phenol-formaldehyde resin (PFR; 14.8%) being major components. Three main morphological types of MPs were identified, and fragments (78.1%) are the dominant type. MPs in the atmosphere were concentrated in the small particle size segment (20–50 µm). The concentration of MPs in the air mass from marine transport was 14.7 items/m3 – lower than that from terrestrial transport (32.0 items/m3). The number concentration of airborne MPs was negatively correlated with relative humidity. MPs from terrestrial transport were mainly rubber (20.2%), while those from marine transport were mainly PFR (18%). MPs in the marine transport air mass were more aged and had a lower number concentration than those in the terrestrial transport air mass. The number concentration of airborne MPs is higher during the day than at night. These findings could contribute to the development of targeted control measures and methods to reduce MP pollution. © 2023,\n",
       " Plastic pollution has reached concerning levels globally, with single-use plastic products (SUPs) comprising at least 50% of plastic waste. This study investigates the physical and chemical degradation of frequently used SUPs, including petroleum-based and bio-based plastics, in natural Northern European coastal weather and marine environments over a three-year period from 2019 to 2022. Addressing a critical knowledge gap, this research was based on a hypothesis that real-world ageing studies on SUPs would produce more accurate time- and process-lines for their transformation from macro-to microplastics than are available today based on the modeling studies more frequently used. The study employs optical examination, mechanical testing, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine and relate physical and chemical changes with time. The results indicate that SUPs undergo significantly faster degradation in natural weather than predicted to date. Photooxidation emerges as the primary degradation pathway for all SUPs, emphasizing the role of light in plastic breakdown. Importantly, physical degradation to microplastics in natural environments is not always associated with significant chemical changes such as breaking chemical bonds. Black SUPs exhibit greater resistance to visible light and ultraviolet radiation than equivalent white and transparent examples. In marine environments, SUPs degrade measurably slower than in air, their degradation slowing with increasing distance from the water surface. Our findings indicate the urgent need for strategies that mitigate the impacts of photo-oxidation of SUPs. Such strategies may include a focus on the removal of post-use SUPs from pavements, roads, beaches, and water surfaces where photo-oxidation is faster than underwater and underground. Preferential use of black SUPs over white or transparent should also be considered. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics are polymer-based materials with carbon as their main framework. During degradation, they release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Additionally, environmental microplastics can enter plant tissues, triggering oxidative stress in plant cells, adversely affecting photosynthesis, metabolism, gene expression, and other growth parameters. This reduction in plant efficiency in sequestering and utilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide indirectly impacts global carbon cycling, exacerbating the global greenhouse effect. Furthermore, environmental microplastics significantly alter soil structure and the composition of microbial communities, affecting the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, thus indirectly promoting greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing research suggests a mutual reinforcement between microplastic pollution and global climate warming, where microplastic pollution exacerbates global climate warming, and the rise in global average temperature leads to the resuspension of microplastics in sediments, intensifying microplastic pollution in the environment. This article primarily focuses on the impacts of environmental microplastic pollution on different ecosystems and the relationship between microplastic pollution and global climate warming. It summarizes the effects of microplastic pollution on greenhouse gas emissions in marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric ecosystems, as well as the mechanisms by which microplastics and climate change affect ecosystem services. By delving into the intricate connection between microplastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, this paper aims to raise awareness of the climate change caused by microplastic pollution and calls for further research on the impacts of microplastics on ecosystems and global climate change, with the ultimate goal of protecting ecosystems and human health.

       " Synthetic fibrous textiles are ubiquitous plastic commodities in everyday existence. Nevertheless, there exists a dearth of understanding regarding their environmental occurrence and the releasing capacities of associated additives. In this study, ten additives were determined in twenty-eight kinds of daily used plastic products including face masks, synthetic clothing, and food containers. Our results revealed that a typical kind of fibrous plastic, face masks, contained a greater variety of additives with UV stabilizers in particular, when compared to other plastic commodities. The above phenomena triggered our field investigation for the occurrence and release potentials of face mask fibers and the co-existing UV stabilizers into the environment. We further collected 114 disposed masks from coastal areas and analyzed their UV stabilizer concentrations. Results showed that the abundance of littered face masks ranged from 40–1846 items/km2 along the Yangtze Estuary, China; and UV stabilizers were of 0.3 ± 0.7 ng/g and 0.7 ± 1.7 ng/g in main bodies and ear ropes, respectively. The UV stabilizer concentrations in the field collected masks were only ∼7 % of their new counterparts, implying their potential leaching after disposal. By simulating the weathering scenario, we predict that a substantial amount of microplastics, with 1.1 × 1010 polypropylene fibers and 3.7 × 1010 polyester fibers, are probably be released daily into the coastal environment after face masks disposal; whereas the accompanied leaching amount of UV stabilizers was relatively modest under the current scenario. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution and climate change, the two seemingly distinct phenomena of global concern, are interconnected through various pathways. The connecting links between the two include the biological carbon pumps in the oceans, the sea ice, the plastisphere involved in biogeochemical cycling and the direct emissions of greenhouse gases from microplastics. On one hand, the presence of microplastics in the water column disrupts the balance of the natural carbon sequestration by affecting the key players in the pumping of carbon, such as the phytoplankton and zooplankton. On the other hand, the effect of microplastics on the sea ice in Polar Regions is two-way, as the ice caps are transformed into sinks and sources of microplastics and at the same time, the microplastics can enhance the melting of ice by reducing the albedo. Microplastics may have more potential than larger plastic fragments to release greenhouse gases (GHGs). Microbe-mediated emission of GHGs from soils is also now altered by the microplastics present in the soil. Plastisphere, the emerging microbiome in aquatic environments, can also contribute to climate change as it hosts complex networks of microbes, many of which are involved in greenhouse gas production. To combat a global stressor like climate change, it needs to be addressed with a holistic approach and this begins with tracing the various stressors like microplastic pollution that can aggravate the impacts of climate change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Indonesia has the second-highest level of ocean plastic pollution. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, used in food and beverage packaging, is the most accessible plastic for recycling. Recycling PET plastic waste can address the issue of waste management and support a circular economy, while protecting the environment. However, consumer participation is crucial for maintaining recycling programs. In this study, we determined the driving forces of customer participation with respect to post-consumption PET waste. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to understand the factors that motivate the consumers’ recycling intentions. We conducted a survey to assess the post-consumption behavior related to PET usage (with 294 respondents), using a questionnaire; to analyze the survey results, we used a structural equation model with partial least squares (SEM-PLS). The attitudes, moral norms, and consequence awareness of the consumers significantly affected their recycling intentions. Perceived behavior and subjective norms did not affect this desire. In Indonesia, consumer behavior after PET consumption primarily involves disposal. This study improves the understanding of consumer behavior and can help businesses and governments to implement strategies that encourage consumers to return used PET goods. In addition, this study enriches the literature on reverse logistics from a consumer perspective. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Seagrass meadows are one of the world's most diverse ecosystems offering habitats for an extensive array of species, as well as serving as protectors of coral reefs and vital carbon sinks. Furthermore, they modify hydrodynamics by diminishing water flow velocities and enhancing sediment deposition, indicating the potential for microplastic accumulation in their sediments. The build-up of microplastics could potentially have ecological impacts threatening to ecosystems, however little is known about microplastic abundance and controlling factors in seagrass sediments. Here we investigated microplastic characteristics and abundances within sediments underlying four seagrass meadow sites on the Turneffe Atoll, Belize. Sediment cores were collected and sub-sampled to include a range of replicate surface sediments (0–4 cm) and depth cores (sediment depths 0–2, 2–5, 5–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm). These were analysed using 25 μm resolution μFTIR, with spectral maps processed using siMPle software. Microplastics were prevalent across the sites with an abundance range (limit of detection (LOD) blank-corrected) of < LOD to 17137 microplastics kg−1 dw found on the east side of the atoll. However, their abundances varied greatly between the replicate samples. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most commonly detected polymers overall, although the dominant polymer type varied between sites. There were no differences in the abundance of microplastics between sites, nor could abundance distributions be explained by seagrass cover. However, abundances of microplastics were highest in sediments with lower proportions of fine grained particles (clay, <4 μm) suggesting that hydrodynamics override seagrass effects. Additionally, no patterns were seen between microplastic abundance and depth of sediment. This suggests that microplastic abundance and distribution in seagrass meadows may vary significantly depending on the specific geographical locations within those meadows, and that more complex hydrodynamic factors influence spatial variability at a localised scale. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The vertical settling of plastic debris in oceans is poorly understood. A large share of low-density microplastics (LDMPs) are largely absent from sea surfaces. The present study employs a model that considers the potential of an overlooked microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) process and new motion equations for irregular LDMPs. Here we show that the motion of LDMPs in the present model, exhibiting a damped oscillation pattern, is quite different from that in biofouling models. Furthermore, LDMPs in the size range of 10–200 µm are most likely to gain sufficient density at the biofouling/MICP stage to independently sink to the ocean floor with relatively small drag coefficients, potentially explaining the selective enrichment of LDMPs in the oceanic sediment. The size and shape exhibit strong non-linear effects on the settling patterns of LDMPs. Overall, the present study highlights the importance of calcite-mediated sinking of LDMPs in open oceans. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Background: Plastic pollution is a severe threat to marine ecosystems. While some microbial enzymes can degrade certain plastics, the ability of the global ocean microbiome to break down diverse environmental plastics remains limited. We employed metatranscriptomic data from an international ocean survey to explore global and regional patterns in microbial plastic degradation potential. Results: On a global oceanic scale, we found no significant correlation between levels of plastic pollution and the expression of genes encoding enzymes putatively identified as capable of plastic degradation. Even when looking at different regional scales, ocean depth layers, or plastic types, we found no strong or even moderate correlation between plastic pollution and relative abundances of transcripts for enzymes with presumed plastic biodegradation potential. Our data, however, indicate that microorganisms in the Southern Ocean show a higher potential for plastic degradation, making them more appealing candidates for bioprospecting novel plastic-degrading enzymes. Conclusion: Our research contributes to understanding the complex global relationship between plastic pollution and microbial plastic degradation potential. We reveal that the transcription of putative plastic-degrading genes in the global ocean microbiome does not correlate to marine plastic pollution, highlighting the ongoing danger that plastic poses to marine environments threatened by plastic pollution. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The information concerning the effects of microplastics (MPs) on lake sediment environment, particularly structural properties, is still scant. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MPs characteristics (including concentration and size) on the sediment rheological properties, which affected sediment resuspension. After 60-day experiments, it was found that (0.5–2 %) MP in sediments decreased sediment viscosity, yield stress, and flow point shear stress by 14.7–38.4 %, 3.9–24.1 % and 13.5–36.5 %. Besides, sediment (with 50 μm MP addition) yield stress and flow point shear stress also dropped by 1.1–14.1 % and 9.6–12.9 % compared to 100 and 200 μm MP addition. The instability in sediment structure could be attributed to MP-induced EPS production and cation exchange capacity (CEC) changes. Accordingly, the decreases in rheological properties induced by different sizes and concentrations MPs might facilitate the sediments resuspension with wind and wave disturbances. The study shed light on previously overlooked environmental issues caused by MPs characteristics from a new perspective, thereby enhancing our understanding about the environmental behavior of MPs in lake sediment ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Polystyrene foam, which is used as a buoyant material in mariculture, is a common constituent of marine plastic debris. Here, we conduct analyses on polystyrene foam debris collected on the east coast of Xiamen Island, China, and associated plastic-burrowing clamworms. We apply interferometry, mass spectrometry and microscopy to polystyrene foam fragments excreted by the benthic clamworms (Perinereis vancaurica). We find evidence of polystyrene digestion and degradation during passage of the clamworm gut leading to the formation and accumulation of microplastics, with a mean diameter of 0.6 ± 0.2 mm. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of clamworm intestines indicated diverse bacterial gut microbiome, dominated by Acinetobacter and Ruegeria bacteria. Further characterization confirmed that polystyrene was degraded by representative gut isolates of Acinetobacter johnsonii, Brevibacterium casei, and Ruegeria arenilitoris. During a 30-day incubation, we observed a very slight decrease in polystyrene weight, changes in chemical group and thermal characteristic, and production of polystyrene metabolic intermediates. Our findings indicate that polystyrene-degrading bacteria in the gut microbiome of clamworms may influence plastic fragmentation and degradation in marine ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have accumulated in the oceans, causing adverse effects on marine organisms and the environment. Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) is considered as an excellent substitute for traditional petroleum-based plastics, but it is difficult to degrade completely and easily become MPs in the marine environment. To test the ecological risk of bio-based PLA, we exposed thick-shelled mussels (Mytilus coruscus) to bio-based PLA and petroleum-based polystyrene (PS) (at 102, 104, and 106 particles/L) for 14 days. The significant increase in enzyme activities related to oxidative stress and immune response showed that mussels were under physiological stress after MP ingestion. While enzyme activities of nerve conduction and energy metabolism were significantly disturbed after exposure. Meanwhile, normal physiological activities in respiration, ingestion and assimilation were also suppressed in association with enzyme changes. The negative effects of PS and PLA in mussels were not differentiated, and further integration analysis of integrated biomarker response (IBR) and principal component analysis (PCA) also showed that PLA would induce adverse effects in mussels and ecological risks as PS, especially at environmental concentrations. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the environmental and ecological risk of bio-based MP PLA accumulating in the marine environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution in urban environments is a pervasive and complex problem with significant environmental and human health implications. Although studies have been conducted on MP pollution in urban environments, there are still research gaps in understanding the exact sources, regulation, and impact of urban MP on the environment and public health. Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the complex pathways, harmful effects, and regulatory efforts of urban MP pollution. It discusses the research challenges and suggests future directions for addressing MPs related to environmental issues in urban settings. In this study, original research papers published from 2010 to 2024 across ten database categories, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, were selected and reviewed to improve our understanding of urban MP pollution. The analysis revealed multifaceted sources of MPs, including surface runoff, wastewater discharge, atmospheric deposition, and biological interactions, which contribute to the contamination of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. MPs pose a threat to marine and terrestrial life, freshwater organisms, soil health, plant communities, and human health through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure. Current regulatory measures for MP pollution include improved waste management, upgraded wastewater treatment, stormwater management, product innovation, public awareness campaigns, and community engagement. Despite these regulatory measures, several challenges such as; the absence of standardized MPs testing methods, MPs enter into the environment through a multitude of sources and pathways, countries struggle in balancing trade interests with environmental concerns have hindered effective policy implementation and enforcement. Addressing MP pollution in urban environments is essential for preserving ecosystems, safeguarding public health, and advancing sustainable development. Interdisciplinary collaboration, innovative research, stringent regulations, and public participation are vital for mitigating this critical issue and ensuring a cleaner and healthier future for urban environments and the planet. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution, especially secondary microplastics (MPs), poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems. Despite its prevalence, the impact of natural-aged MPs on marine organisms, hindered by collection challenges, remains poorly understood. This study focused on 1–3 μm natural-aged MPs collected from Japan's coastal sea, investigating their effects on the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis sensu stricto and its reproductive mechanisms. Rotifers exposed to varying MP concentrations (0, 20, and 200 particles/mL) over 14-day batch cultures exhibited reduced population growth and fertilization rates. Down-regulation of reproductive genes and up-regulation of oxidative stress-related genes were observed, indicating MP-induced disruptions. Enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase and acetylcholinesterase and elevated malondialdehyde levels further emphasized oxidative stress. These findings underscore the detrimental impact of MPs on rotifer reproductivity, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic is ubiquitous within the global marine environment, essentially becoming part of the environment and the ecology of these ecosystems. In Mediterranean ecosystems seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica provide key ecosystem services like preventing coastal erosion slowing down the water flow velocity and acting as sediment traps. Recent studies have reported how as for sediments particles, seagrass meadows could be also retaining plastic items in their internal structures. In this study, a total of 93 Posidonia oceanica egagropiles were collected floating at sea in two coastal areas of the Balearic Islands during the summer season of 2017. Once at laboratory the perimeter of each egagropiles was measured and plastics inside them were visually sorted under the stereomicroscope to identify whether marine plastic was becoming part of their internal structure. Results indicate that 30 % of the egagropiles from the eastern coast of Mallorca (Cala Ratjada) contained plastics, while only 13 % of the egagropiles from the northern coast (Can Picafort) had plastics inside them. In addition, identified plastics have been validated with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy indicating that marine plastics with different polymeric composition, mainly polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polypropylene are becoming part of these organic structures. Results from this study are important since it could be indicating transference of plastics along different marine coastal habitats. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic processes in sedimentary records from estuaries with legacy pollutants is an essential task, as it provides baselines to predict future environmental trajectories of coastal areas. Here, we have addressed the recent transformation history of the mining-impacted Nalón Estuary (Asturias, N Spain). Surface and core sediment records from marshes and tidal flats were examined through a broad multidisciplinary approach, involving micropaleontological (benthic foraminifera), sedimentological (grain-size), geochemical (trace metals, major element Al and total organic carbon), physical (magnetic susceptibility, frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility and large microplastics) and radioisotopic (210Pb, 137Cs and 239+240Pu) proxies. Results suggest that the interplay between natural (high fluvial influence and extreme hydrological events) and anthropogenic (coal and mercury mining disposals) factors induced strong sedimentation-erosion processes, further shaping the recent evolution of the estuary. Short-time scale and intense sedimentation processes were revealed by overall high sediment accumulation rates, the dilution of some geological signatures and the rapid formation of a marsh in the lower estuary bay. The increasing mining fingerprints during the 20th century were shortly interrupted by the catastrophic riverine flooding of 1938. Conversely, current erosional processes by fluvial influence led to the remobilization of contaminated sedimentary materials and exposure of mining-legacy Hg levels in tidal flats from the middle sector. Fluvial activity, floodings and taphonomic biases exerted a major control on benthic foraminifera since the 19th century, although Hg ecotoxicological effects on modern assemblages at certain areas within the estuary cannot be discarded. These findings, along with the documented enhanced erosion of marshes with ‘trapped’ pollutants (Hg, coal microparticles and microplastics), highlight the importance of monitoring the environmental and geomorphic processes taking place in historically-contaminated estuaries. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The objective of this study was to analyze the presence of plastic debris in the digestive tract contents of Micropogonias furnieri, the most important demersal fish species from the Southeastern Brazilian Bight. In the laboratory, a total of 150 individuals were measured (230≤TL≤674 mm), weighed (136≤TW≤3221 g), and their gut contents were evaluated. The ingested food items were identified, and the plastic debris observed under the stereomicroscope were isolated and subjected to the physical analysis Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to identify the chemical composition and to determine the polymers. A total of 190 plastic particles were observed in 51.8% of the stomachs containing food. The recovered plastic debris varied from one to twelve particles per individual (mean ± s.d. of 3.33 ± 2.25). Color varied and the particle size ranged from 0.075 to 19.139 mm. There was no relationship between the number of plastic debris recovered in the stomachs of M. furnieri and the total length, total weight, stomach weight, and percent repletion. The most common polymers were polyamide (28.42%), and polystyrene (27.37%), and the total value of polymer hazard index to M. furnieri diet was 35,544.77, corresponding to an extreme danger, with very toxic with long-lasting effects. Considering the effects of plastic ingestion by marine fish and the potential risks to human health, the contamination of the whitemouth croaker with items that are harmful to its diet reveals a problem of environmental contamination, an alarming concern about plastic pollution in marine systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) raise concerns not only as pollutants themselves, but also due to their ability to act as vectors of pollutants adsorbed from seawater, transferring them to marine organisms. However, the relevance of MPs as carriers of pollutants compared to microalgae needs further exploration. This study compared the role of MPs (2–10 μm non-oxidized and 10–15 μm oxidized high-density polyethylene) and natural organic particles (Rhodomonas lens microalgae, MA) as carriers of mercury (Hg, 2.3 μg Hg/L) and chlorpyrifos (CPF, 1.0 μg CPF/L) to adult Acartia tonsa copepods, after 24–48 h exposure. Dose-response experiments were first performed with adult female copepods exposed to oxidized MPs (0.25–4.0 mg/L), waterborne Hg (0.01–10.0 μg/L) and Ox MPs + Hg (0.25–4.0 mg oxidized MPs/L + 0.50–8.0 μg Hg/L) for 48 h, to complement previous studies that focused on the pesticide CPF. Effects were evaluated with four replicates for physiological and reproductive responses (6 females/replicate), biochemical techniques (40 individuals/replicate) and Hg/CPF bioaccumulation measurements (1000 individuals/replicate). Copepods accumulated Hg/CPF similarly from dissolved pollutants (6204 ± 2265 ng Hg/g and 1251 ± 646 ng CPF/g) and loaded MPs (3125 ± 1389 ng Hg/g and 1156 ± 266 ng CPF/g), but significantly less from loaded MA (21 ± 8 ng Hg/g and 173 ± 80 ng CPF/g). After 24–48 h, copepods exposed to MPs + Hg/CPF showed generally greater biological effects than those exposed to dissolved Hg/CPF or to MA + Hg/CPF, although differences were not statistically significant. MA + CPF had significantly lower AChE inhibition (1073.4 nmol min−1 mg−1) and MA + Hg lower GRx induction (48.8 nmol min−1 mg−1) compared to MPs + Hg/CPF and dissolved Hg/CPF (182.8–236.4 nmol min−1 mg−1 of AChE and 74.1–101.7 nmol min−1 mg−1 of GRx). Principal component analysis suggested different modes of action for Hg and CPF. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Rivers are the natural drainage system, transporting anthropogenic wastes and pollution, including microplastics (plastic < 5 mm). In a riverine system, microplastics can enter from different sources, and have spatial variance in concentration, physical and chemical properties, and imposed risk to the ecosystem. This pilot study presents an examination of microplastics in water and sediment samples using a single sample collection from the rural Raquette River, NY to evaluate a hypothesis that distinct locations of the river, such as downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, upstream of a hydro-dam, and river confluence, may be locations of higher microplastics concentration. In general, our results revealed the presence of high microplastic concentrations downstream of the wastewater treatment plant (in sediments), upstream of the hydro dam (both water and sediment), and in the river confluence (water sample), compared to other study sites. Moreover, the risk assessment indicates that even in a rural river with most of its drainage basin comprising forested and agricultural land, water, and sediment samples at all three locations are polluted with microplastics (pollution load index, PLI > 1; PLIzone = 1.87 and 1.68 for water and sediment samples respectively), with risk categories between Levels I and IV (“minor” to “danger”). Overall, the river stands in a “considerable” risk category (PRIzone = 134 and 113 for water and sediment samples respectively). The overall objective of this pilot study was to evaluate our hypothesis and advance our understanding of microplastic dynamics in rural river systems, elucidating their introduction from a point source (wastewater treatment plant), transit through an impediment (hydro-dam), and release into a vital transboundary river (confluence of Raquette-St. Lawrence Rivers). © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " High concentrations of microplastic (MP) particles have been reported in the Arctic Ocean. However, studies on the high-resolution lateral and vertical transport of MPs from the European waters to the Arctic are still scarce. Here, we provide information about the concentrations and compositions of MPs in surface, subsurface, and deeper waters (< 1 m, ∼ 4 m, and 17–1679 m) collected at 18 stations on six transects along the Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC) using an improved Neuston Catamaran, the COntinuos MicroPlastic Automatic Sampling System (COMPASS), and in situ pumps, respectively. FTIR microscopy and spectroscopy were applied to measure MP concentration, polymer composition, and size distribution. Results indicate that the concentrations of small microplastics (SMPs, <300 μm) varied considerably (0–1240 MP m−3) within the water column, with significantly higher concentrations in the surface (189 MP m−3) and subsurface (38 MP m−3) waters compared to deeper waters (16 MP m−3). Furthermore, the average concentration of SMPs in surface water samples was four orders of magnitude higher than the abundance of large microplastics (LMPs, >300 μm), and overall, SMPs <50 μm account for >80 % of all detected MPs. However, no statistically significant geographical patterns were observed in SMP concentrations in surface/subsurface seawaters between the six sampling transects, suggesting a relatively homogeneous horizontal distribution of SMPs in the upper ocean within the NCC/Norwegian Atlantic Current (NwAC) interface. The Lagrangian particle dispersal simulation model further enabled us to assess the large-scale transport of MPs from the Northern European waters to the Arctic. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This research utilized machine learning to analyze experiments conducted in an open channel laboratory setting to predict microplastic transport with varying discharge, velocity, water depth, vegetation pattern, and microplastic density. Four machine learning (ML) models, incorporating Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms, were developed and compared with the Linear Regression (LR) statistical model, using 75% of the data for training and 25% for validation. The predictions of ML algorithms were more accurate than the LR, while XGB and RF provided the best predictions. To explain the ML results, Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was employed by using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to predict the global behavior of variables. RF was the most reliable model, with a coefficient of correlation of 0.97 and a mean absolute percentage error of 1.8% after hyperparameter tuning. Results indicated that discharge, velocity, water depth, and vegetation all influenced microplastic transport. Discharge and vegetation enhanced and reduced microplastic transport, respectively, and showed a response to different vegetation patterns. A strong linear positive correlation (R2 = 0.8) was noted between microplastic density and retention. In the absence of dedicated microplastic transport analytical models and infeasibility of using classical sediment transport models in predicting microplastic transport, ML proved to be helpful. Moreover, the use of XAI will reduce the black-box nature of ML models with effective interpretation enhancing the trust of domain experts in ML predictions. The developed model offers a promising tool for real-world open channel predictions, informing effective management strategies to mitigate microplastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The construction industry significantly contributes to environmental degradation and resource depletion. This paper investigates the use of waste plastic from post-consumer and post-industrial sources as a sustainable alternative in brick manufacturing. By substituting plastic waste for traditional materials like clay or cement, the ecological footprint of brick production is reduced, and plastic pollution is mitigated by diverting waste from landfills and oceans. This study employs dual approach of experimentation as well as machine learning for assessing the strength behaviour of bricks enhanced with plastic, emphasising compressive strength, durability, thermal insulation, and moisture resistance. Utilization of Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) for Waste plastic bricks (WPB) was done by replacing cement and sand in different proportions i.e. 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % of fly ash bricks The best performance was observed at 30 % replacement of sand with waste CPVC. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model also predicted compressive strength and water absorption, identifying key material components influencing brick properties through SHAP value analysis. This combined experimental and predictive modelling approach demonstrates the potential of waste plastic in creating lightweight, sustainable building materials for structural applications, contributing to sustainable construction practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by organisms tend to encapsulate microplastics (MPs), forming an EPS-corona that affects the fate of MPs in marine ecosystems. However, the impact of the EPS-corona on the biotoxicity of MPs to marine organisms remains poorly understood. Herein, the effect of the EPS-corona on the toxicity of polystyrene (PS) MPs of different sizes (0.1 and 1 µm) to Skeletonema costatum (S. costatum) was investigated. The preferential adsorption of medium molecule weight (∼55 kDa) proteins onto PS MPs mainly contributed to the EPS-corona formation, decreasing the surface charge negativity of small-sized PS MPs (0.1 µm) by 72.4 %. Nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) moieties in polysaccharides and proteins were identified as the preferential adsorption sites in the EPS-PS MPs interaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) results, revealing that the binding mode between EPS and PS MPs was mainly hydrogen bonding. In addition, EPS-corona increased the cell density of S. costatum by 35.5–36.0 % when exposed to small-sized PS MPs (0.1 µm, 25–50 mg/L). These findings provide new insights into how EPS-corona affects the environmental fate and ecological risks associated with micro- and nano-sized plastics in marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a diagnostic method for the assessment of the lower respiratory airway health status in horses. Differential cell count and sometimes also total nucleated cell count (TNCC) are routinely measured by time-consuming manual methods, while faster automated methods exist. The aims of this study were to compare: 1) the Sysmex XN-V body fluid (BF) mode with the manual techniques for TNCC and two-part differential into mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells; 2) the Olympus VS200 slide scanner and software generated deep-learning-based algorithm with manual techniques for four-part differential cell count into alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells. The methods were compared in 69 clinical BAL samples. Results: Incorrect gating by the Sysmex BF mode was observed on many scattergrams, therefore all samples were reanalyzed with manually set gates. For the TNCC, a proportional and systematic bias with a correlation of r = 0.79 was seen when comparing the Sysmex BF mode with manual methods. For the two-part differential count, a mild constant and proportional bias and a very small mean difference with moderate limits of agreement with a correlation of r = 0.84 and 0.83 were seen when comparing the Sysmex BF mode with manual methods. The Sysmex BF mode classified significantly more samples as abnormal based on the TNCC and the two-part differential compared to the manual method. When comparing the Olympus VS200 deep-learning-based algorithm with manual methods for the four-part differential cell count, a very small bias in the regression analysis and a very small mean difference in the difference plot, as well as a correlation of r = 0.85 to 0.92 were observed for all four cell categories. The Olympus VS200 deep-learning-based algorithm also showed better precision than manual methods for the four-part differential cell count, especially with an increasing number of analyzed cells. Conclusions: The Sysmex XN-V BF mode can be used for TNCC and two-part differential count measurements after reanalyzing the samples with manually set gates. The Olympus VS200 deep-learning-based algorithm correlates well with the manual methods, while showing better precision and can be used for a four-part differential cell count. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution poses a worldwide environmental challenge, affecting wildlife and human health. Assessing the biodegradation capabilities of natural microbiomes in environments contaminated with microplastics is crucial for mitigating the effects of plastic pollution. In this work, we evaluated the potential of landfill leachate (LL) and estuarine sediments (ES) to biodegrade polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polycaprolactone (PCL), under aerobic, anaerobic, thermophilic, and mesophilic conditions. PCL underwent extensive aerobic biodegradation with LL (99 ± 7%) and ES (78 ± 3%) within 50–60 days. Under anaerobic conditions, LL degraded 87 ± 19% of PCL in 60 days, whereas ES showed minimal biodegradation (3 ± 0.3%). PE and PET showed no notable degradation. Metataxonomics results (16S rRNA sequencing) revealed the presence of highly abundant thermophilic microorganisms assigned to Coprothermobacter sp. (6.8% and 28% relative abundance in anaerobic and aerobic incubations, respectively). Coprothermobacter spp. contain genes encoding two enzymes, an esterase and a thermostable monoacylglycerol lipase, that can potentially catalyze PCL hydrolysis. These results suggest that Coprothermobacter sp. may be pivotal in landfill leachate microbiomes for thermophilic PCL biodegradation across varying conditions. The anaerobic microbial community was dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens assigned to Methanothermobacter sp. (21%), pointing at possible syntrophic interactions with Coprothermobacter sp. (a H2-producer) during PCL biodegradation. In the aerobic experiments, fungi dominated the eukaryotic microbial community (e.g., Exophiala (41%), Penicillium (17%), and Mucor (18%)), suggesting that aerobic PCL biodegradation by LL involves collaboration between fungi and bacteria. Our findings bring insights on the microbial communities and microbial interactions mediating plastic biodegradation, offering valuable perspectives for plastic pollution mitigation. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The microbial community colonized on microplastics (MPs), known as the ‘plastisphere’, has attracted extensive concern owing to its environmental implications. Coastal salt marshes, which are crucial ecological assets, are considered sinks for MPs. Despite their strong spatial heterogeneity, there is limited information on plastisphere across diverse environments in coastal salt marshes. Herein, a 1-year field experiment was conducted at three sites in the Yancheng salt marsh in China. This included two sites in the intertidal zone, bare flat (BF) and Spartina alterniflora vegetation area (SA), and one site in the supratidal zone, Phragmites australis vegetation area (PA). Petroleum-based MPs (polyethylene and expanded polystyrene) and bio-based MPs (polylactic acid and polybutylene succinate) were employed. The results revealed significant differences in bacterial community composition between the plastisphere and sediment at all three sites examined, and the species enriched in the plastisphere exhibited location-specific characteristics. Overall, the largest difference was observed at the SA site, whereas the smallest difference was observed at the BF site. Furthermore, the MP polymer types influenced the composition of the bacterial communities in the plastisphere, also exhibiting location-specific characteristics, with the most pronounced impact observed at the PA site and the least at the BF site. The polybutylene succinate plastisphere bacterial communities at the SA and PA sites were quite different from the plastispheres from the other three MP polymer types. Co-occurrence network analyses suggested that the bacterial community network in the BF plastisphere exhibited the highest complexity, whereas the network in the SA plastisphere showed relatively sparse interactions. Null model analyses underscored the predominant role of deterministic processes in shaping the assembly of plastisphere bacterial communities across all three sites, with a more pronounced influence observed in the intertidal zone than in the supratidal zone. This study enriches our understanding of the plastisphere in coastal salt marshes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The significant impact of microplastics in the marine environment has sparked global concern. These tiny plastic particles travel from land to the estuary through rivers, where they become intricately distributed within the estuarine dynamics. The spatial distribution of plastic debris and sedimentation in the estuary is mainly influenced by the dynamics of the estuary, posing a scientific challenge that demands immediate attention. The main objective of this study is to analyse the microplastic contamination in the water samples collected from the Azhikkal estuary in Kannur, India, subsequent to the establishment of a seaport in the region, using a home assembled micro-Raman spectrometer. This research sheds light on the extensive prevalence of microplastics detected in the vicinity of the estuary's entrance, with a specific focus on the consequences of seaport construction in the surrounding region. Within the surveyed region, a considerable quantity of 1260 microplastic particles and 1480 anthropogenic particles were identified. The predominant plastic varieties observed in this particular area consist of polystyrene (38 %), polysulfone (5 %), polypropylene (1 %), and polyethylene terephthalate (1 %). The predominant microplastics discovered in this region consisted mainly of fragments (82 %) and fibers (15 %), varying in sizes from 10 to 100 μm (36 %), resulting in a higher surface area to volume ratio. The existence of red and blue pigments, such as copper phthalocyanine and indigo blue, in plastic pollution discovered in this vicinity is causing alarm over the potential harmful consequences on marine organisms that rely on these ecosystems. The identification of these pigments in the estuarine region and aquatic environments across the entire nation has not been adequately pursued. Additionally, this research delves into the spread of microplastics in the murky estuarine setting, considering the significant impact of sea surface wind and alterations in buoyancy following the formation of a biofilm on their surface. This leads to the microplastics acquiring hydrophilic characteristics within the turbid estuarine environment. © 2024,\n",
       " As an emerging marine pollutant, microplastics represent a focal point in global monitoring and management efforts. With seawater accounts for 97 % of the total global water resources, scientific assessments of microplastics in seawater are crucial for pollution control and management of marine environments. This study focuses on investigating microplastics in near-shore seawater and proposes a rapid and accurate detection method using a constructed confocal Raman spectroscopy detection system. By optimizing the pretreatment process of seawater microplastic samples, the efficient removal of organic matter interference in microplastic detection is achieved. Employing fluorescent labeling addresses the issues of prolonged detection time and high false positive rates associated with traditional methods, enabling rapid differentiation between microplastics and other substances and significantly enhancing detection efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the use of differential Raman spectroscopy effectively mitigates fluorescence signal interference, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra. By employing dual-wavelength laser excitation at 784 nm/785 nm, microplastics such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) ranging in size from 60 to 500 μm are successfully detected in seawater. The results demonstrate that the proposed pretreatment method for seawater microplastics and novel detection techniques enable rapid screening and comprehensive non-destructive detection of microplastics in seawater, thereby facilitating the characterization of marine microplastics and providing scientific support for enhancing the management of microplastic pollution and ecological risk control. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Hazardous compounds from microplastics in coastal and marine environments are adsorbed by live organisms, affecting human and marine life. It takes time, money and effort to study the distribution and type of microplastics in the environment, using appropriate expensive equipment in a laboratory. However, deep learning can assist in identifying and quantifying microplastics from an image. This paper presents a novel microplastic classification method that combines the benefits of UV light with deep learning. The Faster-RCNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone was implemented to detect and identify microplastics. Microplastic images from the field taken under UV light were used to train and validate the model. This classification model achieved a high precision of 85.5–87.8%, and the mAP scores were 33.9% on an internal test set and 35.7% on an external test set. This classification approach provides a high-accuracy, low-cost, and time-effective automated identification and counting of microplastics. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have found extensive application globally due to their low cost, flexibility and light weight. Microplastic pollution is a growing environmental concern that poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including African freshwater systems. Nevertheless, although Africa houses some of the deepest and largest freshwater rivers and lakes in the world such as Lake Tanganyika and Victoria, River Congo and the Nile, there is limited information available regarding the presence of MPs in these inland waters. Selected published data on MPs in African freshwater systems, including sediments, biota, rivers, and lakes, were incorporated in this review. The study discovered that the sampling technique employed has a major impact on the morphological characteristics and abundance of MPs in African freshwater systems. Fibers and fragments were the most common shapes; black, white, and transparent were the most prevalent colors; and polyethene terephthalate, polystyrene, and polypropylene were the frequently dominant polymers. As the distance between the sampling sites increased geographically, the polymer similarities declined. MPs have been found to translocate into body cells and tissues where they are capable of causing genetic mutations, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. In Africa, MPs are poorly managed and monitored, and there has been insufficient research done on the possibility that they could be present in drinking water. Considering the fact that humans in the continent are exposed to freshwater and aquatic organisms, the risk assessment routes are currently unvalidated, therefore it was recommended that African nations should strengthen their capacity for plastic management and environmental monitoring. This review provides up to date information on the occurrence, prevalence, ecotoxicity and management of MPs across African freshwater systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Field determination of the metal adsorption capacity of microplastics (MPs) by using a passive sampler had been done in typical subtropical mariculture area in China. The adsorption of eight metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Cr and Cd) by five types of MPs (low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) was compared, including metal types, mariculture types (cage and longline culture), metal residue content in ambient environment, polymer types and particle sizes of MPs. The results showed that Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Pb and Cr in the mariculture environment were contaminated compared with the quality criteria. The concentrations of these six metals adsorbed on five MPs increased linearly with those in seawater. More enriched Cu and As in MPs in marine cage culture than in longline culture, due to the obvious endogenous pollution emissions for the artificial diets, fish medicine and disinfectants. Aged PVC with more cracks and pores showed higher metal adsorption capacity than any other polymers. MPs with a smaller size range of 50–74 μm tended to accumulate higher amounts of metals than those with a larger size range of 74–178 μm, consisting with the surface characteristics of MPs. The significant positive relationship between the concentrations of nutrients in seawater and the adsorption amounts of Cu, Zn and As on MPs implies that the eutrophication would promote their pollution. Based on the ecological risk assessment, the occurrence of MPs could aggravate the potential risk of metals to marine organisms in intensive mariculture areas. This is the first time to reveal the impacts of the adsorption of metals on aged MPs on the potential ecological risks of metals to organisms under the realistic environmental condition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " It's a creative approach to reuse recycled plastic in the building sector rather than landfilling it. Nevertheless, most concrete characteristics have been impacted by the use of recycled plastic aggregates (RPA). Several methods, including treating the RPAs' surface, were used in earlier studies to reduce the harmful impact of the RPAs on the performance of the concrete. Disposing of waste materials on land is a significant environmental risk, which can be mitigated by significantly stepping up recycling initiatives. Plastic pollution of rivers, land, and oceans is a significant problem for the sustainability of the ecosystem due to the availability of waste plastic. Because plastic production is growing exponentially and plastic trash is increasing, scientists and researchers are looking for innovative and sustainable solutions to recycle or reuse plastic waste to reduce its negative environmental effects. Waste plastic has great potential in several sectors, including fabric, apparel, building materials, household goods, and fuel conversion. Adding plastic waste resulting from human waste from various applications into the concrete manufacturing process represents a viable approach and implementation in the future. This process is essential for saving the environment from plastic waste and its dangerous effects. Many studies focus on introducing plastic waste into the concrete-making process as an alternative to construction aggregate in general. Summaries, comparisons, and data analysis from other studies on using plastic waste in concrete are provided in this study. The primary goals of this review study are to lessen plastic waste and assess the mechanical qualities of concrete after adding plastic trash to it. Mechanical qualities, particularly compressive, tensile, and flexural strength, were the subject of numerous tests. This study introduces an innovative method of using recycled plastic in the construction industry instead of disposing it in landfills. Utilizing recycled plastic aggregates (RPAs) substantially influences many properties of concrete. Prior research has utilized several techniques, such as surface treatment of RPAs, to alleviate the adverse impact on the performance of concrete. Disposing of waste materials in landfills is a substantial environmental hazard, which may be reduced by improving recycling initiatives. The escalating production and buildup of plastic trash pose a significant danger to the sustainability of ecosystems in rivers, land, and seas, leading to plastic pollution. Scientists and researchers are actively exploring novel and environmentally friendly methods to recycle or repurpose plastic garbage to minimize its negative environmental effects. Waste plastic has significant potential in several industries, such as textiles, clothing, construction materials, home products, and fuel production. Incorporating plastic trash from many origins into the concrete production procedure is a feasible and sustainable strategy crucial for alleviating the detrimental impact of plastic waste on the environment. This analysis specifically examines the integration of plastic trash into manufacturing concrete, serving as a substitute for conventional building aggregates. This document presents summaries, comparisons, and data analyses derived from research exploring the utilization of plastic waste in concrete. The main objectives are to minimize plastic waste and evaluate the mechanical characteristics of concrete using plastic waste. Many tests were carried out to assess the mechanical characteristics, namely the compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths. For example, adding 10% RPAs led to a 15% decrease in compressive strength, whereas RPAs that underwent surface treatment minimized this effect to just 5%. The tensile strength exhibited a 12% decline when subjected to a 15% concentration of RPAs, while the flexural strength obtained an 18% reduction when exposed to a 20% concentration of RPAs. The findings underscore the possibilities and difficulties of using recycled plastic in concrete applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic mismanagement and its subsequent pollution by rapid economic development and urbanisation pose significant challenges for modern world society. Notwithstanding one of the main sources for macro plastic leakage into the ocean from land, precise assessment of plastic pollution origins from Southeast Asia is yet to be clearly examined. In order to make informed decisions and prioritise areas of improvement it is required to better understand the waste leakage dynamics at the local level. In this work, the Waste Flow Diagram (WFD) was applied to understand the sources and fates of plastics leaking from the solid waste management system for the case of Tuy Hoa City, Phu Yen, Vietnam. The study shows scenarios of leakage into the aquatic environment ranging from 0.8 to 2.7 kg/cap/year, which originates mainly from the collection system. Targeted improvements to this stage of the service could reduce leakages and the overall environmental impacts of mismanaged plastic waste. The results of this study show the necessity and importance of having up to date and reliable data to better inform stakeholders and service planning, facilitating efficient action against plastic pollution. As the first peer-reviewed scientific article critically applying the WFD, this work highlights the steps and challenges of the methodology and critically analyses different methodological pathways. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have drawn exponential attention as anthropogenic pollutants, which have invaded every corner of planet. Seamounts are prominent features of the deep-sea topography, acting as breeding ground for marine animal calves and hotspots of pelagic biodiversity, yet MPs pollution in seamounts is scarcely studied. We investigated the MPs load in the whole vertical profile of seamount ambient water in the Subtropical Northwest Pacific Ocean. Based on focal plane array Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometry, MPs were detected in all layers, and varied from 0.9 to 3.8 items L−1, PP and PE were dominant, PA and PET tended to gather at the seamount summit. With depth increasing, small MPs (20–50 μm) were dominant, and MPs surface roughness including crack, hole, and biofouling showed an increase. Three plastic-degrading bacteria were noted in the layers around the seamount, indicating that the seamount community may accelerate MPs aging and further migration. Our work first unveiled the MPs occurrence in the whole vertical profile of the seamount. It reveals that ocean MPs migration and degradation are significantly affected by the unique topography and biotopes of the seamount. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " In the Anthropocene, plastic pollution has become a new environmental biotope, the so-called plastisphere. In the oceans, nano- and micro-sized plastics are omnipresent and found in huge quantities throughout the water column and sediment, and their large surface area-to-volume ratio offers an excellent surface to which hydrophobic chemical pollutants (e.g. petrochemicals and POPs) can readily sorb to. Our understanding of the microbial communities that breakdown plastic-sorbed chemical pollutants, however, remains poor. Here, we investigated the formation of 500 nm and 1000 nm polystyrene (PS) agglomerations in natural seawater from a coastal environment, and we applied DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with the 500 nm PS sorbed with isotopically-labelled phenanthrene to identify the bacterial members in the seawater community capable of degrading the hydrocarbon. Whilst we observed no significant impact of nanoplastic size on the microbial communities associated with agglomerates that formed in these experiments, these communities were, however, significantly different to those in the surrounding seawater. By DNA-SIP, we identified Arcobacteraceae, Brevundimonas, Comamonas, uncultured Comamonadaceae, Delftia, Sphingomonas and Staphylococcus, as well as the first member of the genera Acidiphilum and Pelomonas to degrade phenanthrene, and of the genera Aquabacterium, Paracoccus and Polymorphobacter to degrade a hydrocarbon. This work provides new information that feeds into our growing understanding on the fate of co-pollutants associated with nano- and microplastics in the ocean. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " In this article, we demonstrate detection and identification of ten microplastic types directly in a water sample using an identification table derived from microplastic hyperspectral images. We selected a total of fourteen wavelengths which can be used to distinguish these ten microplastic types. We enhanced the visibility of these wavelengths by computationally removing water and baseline correcting with reflectance at 1550 nm. This method avoids, prevents, and eases most of the laborious sample preparation mandatory prior to analysis with robust techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The ten different plastics were studied in water, first separately and then in a mixture. The microplastic concentrations varied depending on microplastic type and were kept <12 mg/ml per type. Finally, detection and identification were confirmed pixel-wise in a hyperspectral image of a realistic water matrix simulant including mixtures of only a few microplastic particles. All measurements have been performed with microplastics of different sizes and irregular shapes made in-house by milling commercial pellets and sheets. It enabled the establishment of a procedure for the identification of these vicious particles in real water samples. The present measurement setup of hyperspectral imaging and method of data analysis of a mixture of microplastics directly from a water-based sample may open a path towards fast, reliable, and on-site detection. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are pervasive environmental contaminants that have infiltrated even the most remote ecosystems. Despite their widespread distribution, the transfer patterns and impacts of MPs in remote lakes remain poorly understood. This study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding the pathways and consequences of MP pollution in these isolated environments. Focusing on Kyêbxang Co, a remote salt lake in Tibet, this study investigated the transfer patterns, sources and ecological impacts of MPs, providing insights into their mobility and fate in pristine ecosystems. Water, sediment and biota (brine shrimp) samples from Kyêbxang Co, collected during the summer of 2020, were analyzed using µ-Raman spectroscopy to determine MP abundances, polymer types and potential sources. Findings indicated significant MP contamination in all examined media, with concentrations highlighting the role of runoff in transporting MPs to remote locations. The majority of detected MPs were small fragments (<0.5 mm), constituting over 93 %, with polypropylene being the predominant polymer type. The presence of a halocline may slow the descent of MPs, potentially increasing the exposure and ingestion risk to brine shrimp. Despite the currently low ecological risk estimated for MPs, this study underscores the need for long-term monitoring and development of a comprehensive ecological risk assessment model for MPs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Imaging techniques play a crucial role in characterizing environmental plastics. However, most reported findings rely on two-dimensional projections of particles resting on flat surfaces. This limitation makes it challenging to accurately determine mass concentration, which is essential for deriving toxicologically relevant exposure data. The primary issue arises from the loss of information regarding particle height or thickness. This study aims to evaluate the assumptions necessary to compensate this loss of information. To achieve this, we used a set of environmental plastic particles, mesoplastics and microplastics, from marine campaigns, and precisely measured their three spatial dimensions and mass. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of estimating the mass of plastic particles through two-dimensional images. However, for enhanced accuracy, additional information derived from the dataset of particles under examination is necessary. Specifically, estimating the mass of platelike particles requires information about their height. Similarly, calculating the volume for elongated shapes as cylinders, should be limited to particles with the same width and height and for which their length can be precisely determined, even if the image depicts twisted forms. In conclusion, while obtaining mass concentration from single two-dimensional images enables reasonable estimations, achieving the precision needed for exposure data requires acquiring additional information from the sample and carefully considering the shape of each individual particle. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Over the past few decades, the state of groundwater has become a pressing concern, significantly impacting human health. Groundwater contamination from various pollutants poses substantial risks to communities worldwide, particularly in areas with limited access to clean water. Addressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach, including source control, water quality monitoring, advanced treatment technologies, policy formulation, education, and community engagement. This review paper aims to raise awareness of the diverse factors contributing to water contamination. Examining studies on water pollution from human activities reveals that pesticides, fertilizers, industrial operations, and mining activities are major sources of contamination. Nitrate, harmful substances, and radioactive elements negatively affect the quality of both surface and groundwater, posing significant health risks, especially to vulnerable populations like children and women. Microplastic contamination, primarily from sewage discharge into oceans, poses additional concerns. Geological sources contribute to groundwater contamination through geochemical processes, with fluoride, nitrate, arsenic, uranium, manganese, and various trace elements identified as contaminants. Pharmaceutical ingredients have also been detected in drinking water and fish, albeit in minimal quantities with negligible health risks. Nonetheless, the cumulative impact of pollution sources on individual well-being and quality of life is considerable. Safeguarding groundwater quality is crucial for protecting public health and requires a combination of regulatory measures, technological advancements, community involvement, and sustainable practices. Consistent monitoring of groundwater quality is recommended to identify pollutant sources and develop effective remedial strategies, ensuring healthier and safer environments for current and future generations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Nanoplastics (NPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognized as persistent organic pollutant (POPs) with demonstrated physiological toxicity. When present in aquatic environments, the two pollutants could combine with each other, resulting in cumulative toxicity to organisms. However, the combined impact of NPs and PAHs on microorganisms in seawater is not well understood. In this study, we conducted an exposure experiment to investigate the individual and synergistic effects of NPs and PAHs on the composition, biodiversity, co-occurrence networks of microbial communities in seawater. Exposure of individuals to PAHs led to a reduction in microbial community richness, but an increase in the relative abundance of species linked to PAHs degradation. These PAHs-degradation bacteria acting as keystone species, maintained a microbial network complexity similar to that of the control treatment. Exposure to individual NPs resulted in a reduction in the complexity of microbial networks. Furthermore, when PAHs and NPs were simultaneously present, the toxic effect of NPs hindered the presence of keystone species involved in PAHs degradation, subsequently limiting the degradation of PAHs by marine microorganisms, resulting in a decrease in community diversity and symbiotic network complexity. This situation potentially poses a heightened threat to the ecological stability of marine ecosystems. Our work strengthened the understanding of the combined impact of NPs and PAHs on microorganisms in seawater. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics, particles under 5 mm, pervade aquatic environments, notably in Tarragona’s coastal region (NE Iberian Peninsula), hosting a major plastic production complex. To investigate weathering and yellowness impact on plastic pellets toxicity, sea-urchin embryo tests were conducted with pellets from three locations—near the source and at increasing distances. Strikingly, distant samples showed toxicity to invertebrate early stages, contrasting with innocuous results near the production site. Follow-up experiments highlighted the significance of weathering and yellowing in elevated pellet toxicity, with more weathered and colored pellets exhibiting toxicity. This research underscores the overlooked realm of plastic leachate impact on marine organisms while proposes that prolonged exposure of plastic pellets in the environment may lead to toxicity. Despite shedding light on potential chemical sorption as a toxicity source, further investigations are imperative to comprehend weathering, yellowing, and chemical accumulation in plastic particles. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Development of effective prevention and mitigation strategies for marine plastic pollution requires a better understanding of the pathways and transport mechanisms of plastic waste. Yet the role of estuaries as a key interface between riverine inputs of plastic pollution and delivery to receiving marine environments remains poorly understood. This study quantified the concentration and distribution of microplastics (MPs) (50–3200 μm) in surface waters of the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) in eastern Canada. Microplastics were identified and enumerated based on particle morphology, colour, and size class. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used on a subset of particles to identify polymers. Generalized linear models (Gamma distribution with log-link) examined the relationship between MP concentrations and oceanographic variables and anthropogenic sources. Finally, a risk assessment model, using MP concentrations and chemical hazards based on polymer types, estimated the MP pollution risk to ecosystem health. Mean surface MP concentration in the SLE was 120 ± 42 SD particles m−3; MP concentrations were highest in the fluvial section and lowest in the Northwest Gulf of St. Lawrence. However, MP concentrations exhibited high heterogeneity along the length and width of the SLE. Microplastics were elevated at stations located closer to wastewater treatment plant outflows and downstream sites with more agricultural land. Black, blue, and transparent fibers and fragments ≤250 μm were most commonly encountered. Predominant polymer types included polyethylene terephthalate, regenerated cellulose, polyethylene, and alkyds. While the overall risk to ecosystem health in the entire estuary was considered low, several stations, particularly near urban centres were at high or very high risk. This study provides new insights into the quantification and distribution of MPs and first estimates of the risk of MP pollution to ecosystem health in one of the world's largest estuaries. © 2024,\n",
       " The problem of marine plastic pollution is multifaceted and a substantial threat to the environment and human well-being. Despite being a leading marine plastic contributor in the world, the prevalence of mesoplastics in the Philippines is yet to be ascertained. The study aimed to quantify and characterize the mesoplastics on the 10 sandy beaches (inside and outside the city center) of Iligan City, Philippines. Samples were extracted, quantified, and characterized based on their morphology and chemical composition. A total of 166 mesoplastics were collected from the ten sampling sites. Fragment mesoplastics accounted for 66.9 % of the plastic debris found across all sites, with sizes in the range of 21–25 mm (31.3 %), and white/transparent (31.1 %) being predominant. Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR) spectroscopy identified polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene as the dominant mesoplastic polymer. We also found that mesoplastics were significantly more abundant on beaches within the city center (39.67 ± 3.11 items/m2) than on beaches away from the city center (13.02 ± 1.80 items/m2). This study provides a useful baseline of information on mesoplastic distributions in densely populated urban areas. Our results suggest that there is a pressing need to strengthen existing policies on solid waste management and develop new strategies to mitigate plastic pollution. Addressing this issue is of utmost importance considering the potentially harmful effects of mesoplastics on marine organisms and ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on mesoplastic pollution in the Philippines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " In recent years, the presence and migration of PAEs in packaging materials and consumer products has become a serious concern. Based on this concern, the aim of our study is to determine the possible migration potential and speed of PAEs in benthic fish stored in vacuum packaging, as well as to monitor the storage time and type as well as polyethylene (PE) polymer detection.As a result of the analysis performed by µ-Raman spectroscopy, 1 microplastic (MP) of 6 µm in size was determined on the 30th day of storage in whiting fish muscle and the polymer type was found to be Polyethylene (PE) (low density polyethylene: LDPE). Depending on the storage time of the packaging used in the vacuum packaging process, it has been determined that its chemical composition is affected by temperature and different types of polymers are formed. 10 types of PAEs were identified in the packaging material and stored flesh fish: DIBP, DBP, DPENP, DHEXP, BBP, DEHP, DCHP, DNOP, DINP and DDP. While the most dominant PAEs in the packaging material were determined as DEHP, the most dominant PAEs in fish meat were recorded as BBP and the lowest as DMP. The findings provide a motivating model for monitoring the presence and migration of PAEs in foods, while filling an important gap in maintaining a safe food chain. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Microplastics are plastic fragments measuring less than 5 millimeters which are formed from degraded plastic materials and have the potential to pollute the environment. Due to their widespread presence in the marine environment, microplastics have become a significant global threat. The presence of microplastics is often considered as causing pollution in various environments, especially aquatic ecosystems such as rivers and oceans. Microplastics contamination can even be found in consumed salt, thus raising concerns about its impact on human health. However, information on the presence of microplastics in salt is still very limited. This study aims to determine the abundance and characteristics of microplastics as contaminants in salt and assess the human exposure to microplastics in Indonesia. METHODS: A total of 21 samples of salt products were taken from various brands available in Padang City and Jambi City, Indonesia for analysis. Microplastics extraction was carried out by removing the organic materials contained in the salt samples using 30 percent hydrogen peroxide and then filtering them with a 0.45 micrometer pore filter. A stereomicroscope was used to detect the abundance, shape, size, and color of microplastics, while the Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was utilized to identify the polymer type of the microplastics. Furthermore, human exposure to microplastics can be predicted by calculating the estimated dietary intake and taking into account the daily salt intake. FINDINGS: Microplastics were detected in significant amounts (p<0.05) in all salt samples, ranging from 33 to 313 particles/kilogram. The types of microplastics most commonly found in the samples were fragments (67.49 percent), fibers (23.82 percent), films (6.08 percent), and pellets (2.61 percent). The types of polymer identified include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyester. The dominant microplastics were 100-300 micrometers in size (47.3 percent) and black in color (52.88 percent). It is estimated that adults in Indonesia will be exposed to 60.225-571.225 microplastics/year if they consume 5 grams of salt/day or 120.45-1142.45 microplastics/year if they consume 10 grams of salt/day. CONCLUSION: Of the 21 salt samples analyzed, all were detected to contain microplastics. Inadequate and unhygienic salt production and contaminated seawater used as raw material contribute to microplastics contamination of salt, thus posing a risk to human health. By calculating of daily salt intake of the Indonesian population, it is possible to estimate their daily and annual exposure to microplastics. The results of this study contain useful information for the efforts to prevent microplastics contamination by relevant stakeholders and the provision of education and socialization about the proper salt production process in accordance with food safety standards as to reduce or even eliminate microplastics in salt. In addition, this study can provide valuable data on human exposure to microplastics in salt products that can assist policymakers in making standard references for microplastics. © This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).,\n",
       " Every year, up to 0.3 million tonnes of waste from the European shipping industry is not properly delivered at ports. Most of the waste produced by the shipping industry is plastic waste, putting plastics at the forefront of the shipping industry’s waste management efforts. In an increasingly connected global economy, concerted actions that encourage and incentivise waste minimisation and waste management optimisation are essential for the reduction of marine litter and the achievement of a circular economy within the shipping industry. Cyprus, an important flag state, can take a leadership role towards this direction. This article presents the results of the implementation of the DeCyDe-4-Shipping decision-support participatory method in Cyprus, which allowed effective multi-stakeholder interactions and resulted in the identification of actions for waste minimisation and waste management optimization that are relevant, effective, implementable, and stem from stakeholder consensus. The method resulted in the definition of yearly action plans with prioritized actions and provided the tools through which to monitor the industry’s annual progress. As the shipping industry is dependent on a global supply chain, DeCyDe-4-Shipping could be replicated at a wider geographic scale, starting with Mediterranean ports, to ensure consistent industry progress towards waste minimization and waste management optimization. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " In coastal ecosystems, microplastics (<5 mm plastic particles) are a common occurrence, presenting a pressing global concern, especially on beaches where increased human activity and inadequate waste management exacerbate the issue of plastic pollution. This research investigates the abundance and characteristics of microplastics at six tourist beaches along the western coast of Dapoli, Maharashtra. The sediment samples were collected and subjected to density separation, followed by microscopic observation and shape, size, color, and polymer characterization. The results revealed that microplastic particles ranged in size from 200 to 3000 µm (n=200 particles). The abundance was observed highest in Murud beach with 153 ± 26.8 items kg−1 dw, possibly attributed to increased tourist activity, whereas the lowest abundance of 91.1 ± 16.8 items kg−1 dw was observed in Kelshi beach, likely due to its lower visitor traffic and population density. The predominant shapes observed were fragments and transparent, black, and blue as the dominant colors. Additionally, most samples exhibited spectra resembling High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene (PP), Polystyrene, and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). This baseline study urges awareness for reducing plastic waste and protecting coastal environments from microplastic pollution. Further research is needed to identify specific sources and understand the toxic effects on marine life, contributing to our knowledge of environmental threats posed by microplastics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Urbanization can increase the threat plastic litter poses to beaches around the world. However, many oceanic beaches lack baseline data on how urbanization may be altering plastic litter abundance. Here, I documented the abundance and type of plastic litter at 23 oceanic beaches that spanned an urbanization gradient (as measured by population density) along the California, USA coast in October 2023. Across all 23 sites, I found that urbanization significantly increased abundance for all types of plastic litter including (large microplastic litter 2–5 mm; mesoplastic 5–25 mm; macroplastic >25 mm). I also found that urban beaches had significantly more plastic litter (132.7 pieces/m2 ± 84.2 S.D.) than non-urban beaches (67.4 pieces/m2 ± 30.9 S.D.). In addition, I found that urban beaches had significantly higher abundances of cigarette butts, hard plastic, and foamed plastic than non-urban beaches. Collectively, my findings suggest that plastic litter pollution poses an important threat to California beaches, that oceanic beaches in more urban areas may be more impacted by this threat over time, and that plastic waste from recreation (both on and off-shore) could be an important source of pollution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The presence of plastic debris and organo-brominated compounds in the marine environment poses a concern to wildlife. Plastic can absorb and release chemical compounds, making their ingestion potentially harmful, while chemical compounds have become omnipresent, with a tendency to bioaccumulate in the food web. Seabirds are often used as indicators of marine plastic pollution, yet studies on the exposure of tropical communities to plastic contamination are still scarce. In this study we monitored the amounts of plastics in faeces and organo-brominated compounds ingested/assimilated in feathers by adults and chicks of Cape Verde shearwaters and Bulwer's petrels from Cabo Verde. Anthropogenic pollutants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and naturally generated methoxylated-PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs) were among the probed compounds. The frequency of plastic debris ingestion was similar in both species' adults and chicks, although, the characteristics of the ingested plastic differed. Frequency and number of microplastics increased throughout the nestling season for chicks from both species. All species and age groups showed the presence of PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs. Among PBDEs, Bulwer's petrels exhibited higher concentrations than Cape Verde shearwaters, and chicks had higher concentration profiles than adults. Specifically, Bulwer's petrel chicks showed higher concentrations than Cape Verde shearwater chicks. On the contrary, Cape Verde shearwater adults exhibited higher occurrence and concentrations of MeO-PBDEs when compared to Cape Verde shearwater chicks. We found no effect of plastic loadings or loadings of organohalogen contaminants on body condition or size, although harmful effects may be hidden or reveal themselves in a medium- to long-term. Feather samples from both adults and chicks were shown to be useful for comparing intraspecific contamination levels and appear suitable for the long-term assessment of organohalogen contaminants in seabirds. Species-specific foraging and feeding strategies are likely the drivers of the observed variation in organochlorine contamination burdens among seabird species. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Beneath the surface of our ecosystems, microplastics (MPs) silently loom as a significant threat. These minuscule pollutants, invisible to the naked eye, wreak havoc on living organisms and disrupt the delicate balance of our environment. As we delve into a trove of data and reports, a troubling narrative unfolds: MPs pose a grave risk to both health and food chains with their diverse compositions and chemical characteristics. Nevertheless, the peril extends further. MPs infiltrate the environment and intertwine with other pollutants. Worldwide, microplastic levels fluctuate dramatically, ranging from 0.001 to 140 particles.m-3 in water and 0.2 to 8766 particles.g-1 in sediment, painting a stark picture of pervasive pollution. Coastal and marine ecosystems bear the brunt, with each organism laden with thousands of microplastic particles. MPs possess a remarkable ability to absorb a plethora of contaminants, and their environmental behavior is influenced by factors such as molecular weight and pH. Reported adsorption capacities of MPs vary greatly, spanning from 0.001 to 12,700 μg·g−1. These distressing figures serve as a clarion call, demanding immediate action and heightened environmental consciousness. Legislation, innovation, and sustainable practices stand as indispensable defenses against this encroaching menace. Grasping the intricate interplay between microplastics and pollutants is paramount, guiding us toward effective mitigation strategies and preserving our health ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and microplastics have become a pressing concern due to their widespread presence and potential impacts on ecological systems. To assess the ecosystem-level effects of these pollutants within a multi-stressor context, we simulated real-world conditions by exposing a near-natural multi-trophic aquatic food web to a gradient of environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoxetine and microplastics in large mesocosms over a period of more than three months. We measured the biomass and abundance of different trophic groups, as well as ecological functions such as nutrient availability and decomposition rate. To explore the mechanisms underlying potential community and ecosystem-level effects, we also performed behavioral assays focusing on locomotion parameters as a response variable in three species: Daphnia magna (zooplankton prey), Chaoborus flavicans larvae (invertebrate pelagic predator of zooplankton) and Asellus aquaticus (benthic macroinvertebrate), using water from the mesocosms. Our mesocosm results demonstrate that presence of microplastics governs the response in phytoplankton biomass, with a weak non-monotonic dose-response relationship due to the interaction between microplastics and fluoxetine. However, exposure to fluoxetine evoked a strong non-monotonic dose-response in zooplankton abundance and microbial decomposition rate of plant material. In the behavioral assays, the locomotion of zooplankton prey D. magna showed a similar non-monotonic response primarily induced by fluoxetine. Its predator C. flavicans, however, showed a significant non-monotonic response governed by both microplastics and fluoxetine. The behavior of the decomposer A. aquaticus significantly decreased at higher fluoxetine concentrations, potentially leading to reduced decomposition rates near the sediment. Our study demonstrates that effects observed upon short-term exposure result in more pronounced ecosystem-level effects following chronic exposure. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is now ubiquitous in the environment and represents a growing threat to wildlife, who can mistake plastic for food and ingest it. Tackling this problem requires reliable, consistent methods for monitoring plastic pollution ingested by seabirds and other marine fauna, including methods for identifying different types of plastic. This study presents a robust method for the rapid, reliable chemical characterisation of ingested plastics in the 1–50 mm size range using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. We analysed 246 objects ingested by Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) from Lord Howe Island, Australia, and compared the data yielded by each technique: 92 % of ingested objects visually identified as plastic were confirmed by spectroscopy, 98 % of those were low density polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or their copolymers. Ingested plastics exhibit significant spectral evidence of biological contamination compared to other reports, which hinders identification by conventional library searching. Machine learning can be used to identify ingested plastics by their vibrational spectra with up to 93 % accuracy. Overall, we find that infrared is the more effective technique for identifying ingested plastics in this size range, and that appropriately trained machine learning models can be superior to conventional library searching methods for identifying plastics. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Organo-mineral interaction is an important mechanism affecting the fate of natural organic matter in the environment. Field discoveries since 2014 report a novel type of organo-mineral interaction, where “recalcitrant” plastic polymers either physically or chemically attach onto or fuse into host rocks or sediments. During our previous field observation in 2022, it was reported that weathered low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic films were chemically attached onto sedimentary rocks. It was hypothesized that sunlight irradiation may have triggered chemical interactions following physical attachment of plastic film onto rock surfaces. In this study, we tested this hypothesis through accelerated aging experiments. Specifically, we first explored the interaction mechanisms between low-density polyethylene film and crushed sedimentary rock powders, including sandstone, shale, limestone, and ironstone, through accelerated UV irradiation ranging from 0 to 168 h. Subsequently, we conducted experiments using the plastic film and consolidated shale rocks. We found that chemical binding took place after 48 h of UV irradiation equivalent to 35 days of exposure of plastic film to sunlight on the land surface. The organo-mineral interaction process started with the surface oxidation of plastic film leading to the generation of carbonyl and ether groups. After that, irreversible mineral binding occurred. Visualization of the plastic films following the aging experiments showed that mineral particles were incorporated within the polymer instead of surface attachment. Organo-mineral interaction mechanisms between LDPE film and sedimentary rocks were further explored via multiple approaches including XPS, STEM-EELS, TOF-SIMS, and theoretical calculations. Multiple lines of evidence suggested binding mechanisms for this process, including the formation of chemical bonds such as Si-O-C, corroborating well with our previously reported field findings. The findings of this study offer robust evidence that natural weathering processes, such as sunlight irradiation, can initiate chemical reactions between plastic and rock materials, deepening our understanding of plastic pollution dynamics within the geological context. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Recently, microplastics (MPs) have attracted extensive attention to their wide distribution and potential toxicity in ecosystems. However, there was a lack of research focused on MPs in seaweed bed ecosystems. This study investigated the distribution and toxicity of MPs in macrobenthos in Sargassum ecosystem. According to the in-situ investigation results, the abundance of MPs in the sediment was 0.9–2.3 items/g, the indoor microcosmic experiment was constructed. After exposure to MPs (0, 2, and 20 items/g) for 30 days, the abundance of MPs in macrobenthos exhibits a concentration-dependent increase. However, there was no significant bioaccumulation of MPs at the trophic level. The indoor toxicity test revealed that MPs induced oxidative stress and altered intestinal microflora composition in macrobenthos, even at actual environmental concentrations (2 items/g). It may result in a perturbation of the organism's homeostatic equilibrium. High-concentration (20 items/g) MPs had a greater impact on alkaline phosphatase (AKP) in Mollusks. The increase in AKP activity could be indicative of an adaptive mechanism in some macrobenthos while the decline in AKP activity might signal a decrease in their survival. These results elucidated the fate of MPs in ecosystem and the ecological risks of MPs to large benthic animals on model environmental conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Projected increases in temperature and decreases in salinity associated with global climate change will likely have detrimental impacts on eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, as these variables can influence physiological processes in these keystone species. We set out to determine how the interactive effects of temperature (20 °C or 27 °C) and/or salinity (27‰ or 17‰) impacted the energetic reserves, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, and changes to oxidative stress or total antioxidant potential as a consequence of an altered environment over a 21-day exposure. Gill and adductor muscle were used to quantify changes in total glycogen and lipid content, Electron Transport System and Citrate Synthase activities, Malate Dehydrogenase activity, Protein Carbonyl formation, lipid peroxidation, and total antioxidant potential. A second exposure was performed to determine if these environmental factors influenced the ingestion of microfibers, which are now one of the leading forms of marine debris. Elevated temperature and the combination of elevated temperature and decreased salinity led to an overall decline in oyster mass, which was exacerbated by the presence of microfibers. Changes in metabolism and oxidative stress were largely influenced by time, but exposure to elevated temperature, decreased salinity, the combination of these stressors or exposure to microfibers had small impacts on oyster physiology and survival. Overall these studies demonstrate that oyster are fairly resilient to changes in salinity in short-term exposures, and elevations in temperature or temperature combined with salinity result in changes to the oyster energetic response, which can be further impacted by the presence of microfibers. © 2024,\n",
       " Kelp forests (KFs) are one of the most significant marine ecosystems in the planet. They serve as a refuge for a wide variety of marine species of ecological and economic importance. Additionally, they aid with carbon sequestration, safeguard the coastline, and maintain water quality. Microplastic (MP) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) concentrations were analyzed across trophic levels in KFs around Todos Santos Bay. Spatial variation patterns were compared at three sites in 2021 and temporal change at Todos Santos Island (TSI) in 2021 and 2022. We analyzed these MPs and PBDEs in water, primary producers (Macrocystis pyrifera), grazers (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), predators (Semicossyphus pulcher), and kelp detritus. MPs were identified in all samples (11 synthetic and 1 semisynthetic polymer) and confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy–attenuated total reflectance (μ-FTIR-ATR). The most abundant type of MP is polyester fibers. Statistically significant variations in MP concentration were found only in kelps, with the greatest average concentrations in medium-depth kelps from TSI in 2022 (0.73 ± 0.58 MP g−1 ww) and in the kelp detritus from TSI in 2021 (0.96 ± 0.64 MP g−1 ww). Similarly, PBDEs were found in all samples, with the largest concentration found in sea urchins from Punta San Miguel (0.93 ± 0.24 ng g−1 ww). The similarity of the polymers can indicate a trophic transfer of MPs. This study shows the extensive presence of MP and PBDE subtropical trophic web of a KF, but correlating these compounds in environmental samples is highly complex, influenced by numerous factors that could affect their presence and behavior. However, this suggests that there is a potential risk to the systems and the services that KFs offer. © 2024,\n",
       " Infrastructure is often a limiting factor in microplastics research impacting the production of scientific outputs and monitoring data. International projects are therefore required to promote collaboration and development of national and regional scientific hubs. The Commonwealth Litter Programme and the Ocean Country Partnership Programme were developed to support Global South countries to take actions on plastics entering the oceans. An international laboratory network was developed to provide the infrastructure and in country capacity to conduct the collection and processing of microplastics in environmental samples. The laboratory network was also extended to include a network developed by the University of East Anglia, UK. All the laboratories were provided with similar equipment for the collection, processing and analysis of microplastics in environmental samples. Harmonised protocols and training were also provided in country during laboratory setup to ensure comparability of quality-controlled outputs between laboratories. Such large networks are needed to produce comparable baseline and monitoring assessments. © Crown 2024.,\n",
       " This study focused on evaluating the adaptive capacity of coastal communities to manage marine debris, a critical issue intensified by the effects of human-induced climate change on the Earth's oceans. The detrimental impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean currents and temperatures, pose significant threats to marine ecosystems and human societies. The study specifically investigated the factors influencing the willingness to pay (WTP) for adaptive Marine Debris Management (MDM) services. It involved diverse community groups, including passive observers, compliant followers, and eco-champions, each exhibiting unique approaches and capacities for managing marine debris. The research revealed that while passive observers and compliant followers favor asset-based programs, eco-champions are more inclined towards enhancing environmental awareness and enforcing policies. A critical methodological aspect of the study was the quantification of WTP, set at IDR 10,000 /month/household, to assess the communities' financial commitment to MDM. The study found that WTP is influenced by factors such as awareness of environmental issues, behavioral responses to regulations, beach clean-up participation, environmental education, and recycling training. Of these, income emerged as the most impactful factor on WTP, followed by education level, age, place of residence, and eco-champion classification. Furthermore, the provision of adaptive MDM services positively influenced community WTP. These findings highlight the need for MDM policymakers to develop customized strategies that address different community groups' distinct needs and priorities. The study recommends that such strategies focus on improving understanding and responsiveness to environmental regulations and providing specialized educational programs. By adopting this approach, not only can the immediate challenge of marine debris be tackled, but it can also lead to the establishment of a more sustainable and community-focused model of environmental stewardship. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Laboratory experiments are conducted in a wave flume to investigate the effect of water waves on the transport of plastic pellets over a rippled bottom. The horizontal velocities of plastic debris are analyzed over the rippled bottom for different wave conditions and plastic elements with different properties. Laboratory investigations determined the characteristic transport patterns of wave-induced plastic debris with a density of ∼2.0g/cm3 moving along the rippled bottom. In the first, swing-type motion, the grains move only in the ripple trough with velocities lower than 0.10 m/s. For sliding-type movement, the grains move along the entire rippled surface with velocities in the range of 0.10–0.13 m/s. For higher velocities in the range of 0.15–0.20 m/s, a saltation-type motion becomes dominant. The results show that plastic grains may move up to 2–3 cm above the ripple crest depending on hydrodynamic conditions. The analysis shows that for velocity-skewed flows, sliding-type motion and onshore transport dominate. For acceleration-skewed flows, saltation-type motion and offshore transport dominate, which is attributed to higher boundary layer thickness and phase lag effects. The analysis of the relationship between the particle Reynolds number and the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer reveals that for values of Rep≥1000 and a boundary layer thicknessδ≥50 mm saltation-type motion becomes dominant. The direction of transport is affected not only by the density of the sediment and the wave skewness coefficients but also by the dimensions of the bottom ripples. The laboratory investigations also provide insight into the hydrodynamic conditions affecting the transport of plastic debris along the bottom covered with ripples in oscillating nonlinear water flows. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The degradation of surfaces and its possible dependence on shape, size, and elemental composition of plastic particles were subjected. The surfaces of 146 microplastics were classified from smooth to fully eroded (%) by SEM/EDS. Structural elements and various additives were found on microplastics depending on their shapes. The surface of plastic items > 100 µm in length showed a relatively more eroded area than smaller ones, regardless of their shapes. Depending on shape, the percentage of surface erosion of irregularly shaped fragments < 100 µm was significantly enhanced compared to microbeads of the same size. These results may provide insights into assessing potential risks posed by microplastics and improve our understanding of the role of these parameters concerning possible adverse health effects on the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are significant contributors to microplastic (MP) pollution in marine ecosystems when they are inefficient. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of microplastic removal from the effluent of the Anza WWTP (Morocco), which processes industrial and urban wastewater using a lamellar decantation system combined with a submarine emissary for treated water discharge. Additionally, this study investigated the presence of microplastics in the Atlantic seawater where treatment plant effluent is released. Microplastics were collected and extracted from wastewater and seawater samples to assess their abundance, shape, size, polymer type, and removal rates in the treatment plant. The findings revealed an average MP concentration of 1114 ± 90 MPs/L in the influent and 607 ± 101 MPs/L in the effluent, indicating a removal efficiency of 46 %. Seasonal analysis revealed the highest MP concentrations during the summer, with 2181.33 MPs/L in the influent and 1209 MPs/L in the effluent. Seawater samples from the discharge zone of the submarine emissary had an average MP concentration of 1600 MPs/m3. Characterization of the MPs revealed that fibers were the most common form of MPs in all the samples. The 500–100 μm size fraction was predominant in the WWTP samples, while MPs smaller than 1 mm were more abundant in the seawater samples. Seven polymer types were identified using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), with PET, PE, PVC, PA, PS, PP, and EVA being the most prevalent. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) revealed various degrees of weathering and chemical elements adhering to the MP surfaces. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of conventional treatment systems in removing microplastics and offer a reference for developing management strategies to mitigate MP pollution in Morocco's marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics have received widespread attention in recent years. However, most studies on microplastics have been limited to the aquatic environment. In this review, we categorize and describe the microplastic's degradation pathways and removal methods, including pyrolysis, hydrolysis, biodegradation, and advanced oxidation techniques, such as ultrasonic mechanical degradation. Additionally, we focus on the applicability of photocatalytic degradation as an in-situ removal technique for microplastics in soil, providing a reference for future research. Although soil is an important sink for microplastics and has a much higher abundance than the oceans, there is a lack of comprehensive summary regarding the mechanisms of environmental degradation and removal of microplastics in soil in existing research.

       " The ubiquity of microplastics (MPs) in natural surroundings leads to inevitable human exposure. MPs are reported to be present in daily food products, viz. bottled water, sea salt, packaged foods, beverages, fruits, crops, fishes, and sea foods, mainly due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics, leading to their human exposure across all age groups. In terrestrial environments, soil serves as a potential route of MP exposure to plant communities through plastic mulching, which can have implications on crops and transfer to human trough food chain. Consumption of MPs by aquatic organisms also causes a potential health hazards along food chain through trophic transfer. MPs are also reported to transfer from mother to child via placenta and breast milk. Additionally, MPs can trigger immune responses and hypersensitivity, and induce cellular, gastrointestinal, and developmental cytotoxicity. The aim of the present review is to provide a comprehensive idea on MP exposure through daily food items and their possible health concerns with plausible toxicity pathways. Future research should be oriented toward examining multi-level trophic transmission of MPs. Further, more in vivo studies should be conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms of MP uptake, retention, and depuration in the human body. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " A new worrying micropollutant threathens natural environments: the microfibres (MFs). Natural, regenerated and synthetic MFs have been detected in different environments, as well as in organisms. While synthetic MFs are generally detected in microplastic analyses, natural and regenerated MFs are not taken into account, or are wrongly considered plastics. They are generally considered biodegradable even if their degradation processes in ecosystems are poorly known. Their potential faster degradation could release toxic compounds, and their characteristics could led to a long-term accumulation in the environment. Understanding their dangerousness and the possible impact they could have on ecosystems is fundamental for environment conservation. We collected and investigated water and submerged sediment samples in different caves and springs of the Classical Karst Region (NE Italy), rich in protected habitats and species. MFs were analysed via microscopy and spectroscopy. MFs were found in all samples, highlighting pollution in surface and subterranean habitats of the karst system. MF concentration was higher in submerged sediments respect to waters, highlighting an accumulation of MFs over time. Big microfibres were less abundant, and MF amount increased with the decrease in the considered size. More than 80% of fibres were fluorescent under UV light. Fluorescent MFs were especially transparent, while non-fluorescent ones were mainly black and blue. Most MFs were cellulosic, and synthetic MFs represent only 15–22%, highlighting a significant gap between the MF composition detected in natural environments and the global production of synthetic textiles in recent times. Synthetic MFs were more abundant in waters. Our results improve the knowledge on micropollutants in karst environments, laying the foundations for future research. MF pollution monitoring in karst areas must become a priority for species protection, habitat conservation, and waters management, improving analyses on a larger number of aquatic environments, taking into account the ecological connections between surface and subterranean habitats. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " With the nationwide introduction of wastewater treatment the overall water quality improved significantly, but challenges remain, including diffuse pollution, historical sediment contamination and the presence of a multitude of anthropogenic chemical species. The implementation of several EU directives in the twenty-first century led to a stronger focus on improving water and sediment quality and the sustainable management of sediments at river basin scale. Hence, in the last 25 years, not only have the regulatory frameworks significantly changed, but also the scientific backbone of our products, delivered to Germany’s federal ministries, practitioners from the German Waterways and Shipping Administration, German federal states and the public. In this respect, approaches such as non-target screening, multi-element analysis, effect-based methods, novel approaches in microplastic and nanoparticle analysis and the benefits from the increase in digitalization and automation are key methods and processes to face future challenges, especially those connected to the global climate crisis. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Antarctica has traditionally been viewed as a relatively isolated ecosystem. Although still considered pristine, it is increasingly also being affected by microplastic pollution. Reported high sea floor concentrations raise concern that these ecosystems might act as major sink for microplastic pollution. This is significant as species in those remote ecosystems are likely more sensitive to rapid environmental change due to a high level of specialization, and lower tolerance levels. Microplastic ingestion in fish has barely been assessed in high latitude environments. Here we aimed to provide baseline data for the eastern Weddell Sea, which is particularly remote, and suggested for an area of conservation. By analyzing gastrointestinal tracts of 40 specimens from five species, we report an overall microplastic incidence rate of 0.23. This is lower than recent studies have found for other species in the Southern Ocean, and below global means. The highest incidence rate was detected in L. squamifrons (0.67), followed by P. evansii (0.29). The most common polymer was polyethylene recovered as 8 particles (42.1 %) from one specimen, while from the remaining 11 microplastics polyester was most common (36.8 %). This study shows that even in a remote region of the Antarctic Ocean with almost no vessel traffic, fisheries or touristic activity, bathydemersal and bathypelagic fish exhibit microplastic particles in their gastrointestinal tract. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of anthropogenic debris on the riverbanks of the Ciliwung River, covering upstream to downstream areas. The mean of debris found in each measurement was 32.79 ± 15.38 items/m2 with a weight of 106.00 ± 50.23 g/m2. Plastic debris accounted for over 50 % of all litter items identified and represents 55 % by weight, signifying a significantly high prevalence compared to global studies examining litter along riverbanks. The majority of the plastics found originated from Single-use applications and were predominantly made from Styrofoam. This investigation demonstrated the importance of actions to reduce single use applications and to improve waste management strategies. This can be achieved through proactive initiatives coupled with adaptable approaches, such as implementing effective urban planning and enhancing waste collection capacity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants in the global marine environment. However, few studies have adequately explored the different toxic mechanisms of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in aquatic organisms. The sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, is a key organism in the marine benthic ecosystem due to its crucial roles in biogeochemical cycles and food web. This study investigated the bioaccumulation and adverse effects of polystyrene micro- and nanoplastics (PS-M/NPs) of different sizes (20 μm, 1 μm and 80 nm) in the regenerated intestine of A. japonicus using multi-omics analysis. The results showed that after 30-day exposure at the concentration of 0.1 mg L−1, PS-MPs and PS-NPs accumulated to 155.41–175.04 μg g−1 and 337.95 μg g−1, respectively. This excessive accumulation led to increased levels of antioxidases (SOD, CAT, GPx and T-AOC) and reduced activities of immune enzymes (AKP, ACP and T-NOS), indicating oxidative damage and compromised immunity in the regenerated intestine. PS-NPs had more profound negative impacts on cell proliferation and differentiation compared to PS-MPs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PS-NPs primarily affected pathways related to cellular components, e.g., ribosome, and oxidative phosphorylation. In comparison, PS-MPs had greater influences on actin-related organization and organic compound metabolism. In the PS-M/NPs-treated groups, differentially expressed metabolites were mainly amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol phospholipid, and purine nucleosides. Additionally, microbial community reconstruction in the regenerated intestine was severely disrupted by the presence of PS-M/NPs. In the PS-NPs group, Burkholderiaceae abundance significantly increased while Rhodobacteraceae abundance decreased. Correlation analyses demonstrated that intestinal regeneration of A. japonicus was closely linked to its enteric microorganisms. These microbiota-host interactions were notably affected by different PS-M/NPs, with PS-NPs exposure causing the most remarkable disruption of mutual symbiosis. The multi-omic approaches used here provide novel insights into the size-dependent toxicity of PS-M/NPs and highlight their detrimental effects on invertebrates in M/NPs-polluted marine benthic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In the present study we collected the Thumbprint emperor (Lethrinus harak) from seven landing sites from the coastal waters around Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar (Tanzania) to (i) quantify and characterize microplastics (MPs) in their digestive tracts and (ii) use previously assessed environmental levels in nearshore surface waters and seabed sediments to determine whether L. harak could be a relevant biomonitor for MP pollution in the region. L. harak (n=387) had an overall frequency of occurrence (FO%) of 48 % and displayed spatial variation between sites with Kunduchi (FO=66.7 %) and Mijimwena (FO=17.1 %) having the highest and lowest FO%, respectively. Fish from Mjimwema had a mean MP content of 0.17 ± 0.38 MPs individual-1 whilst fish from Kizimkazi had the highest MP abundance (1.75 ± 2.33 MPs individual-1). Fibers (overall 64.7 %, range across sites 48–86 %) and fragments (17.9 %, 5–25 %) were the most dominant MP types whilst black (46.9 %, 40–58 %) and blue (22.5%, 7–36 %) MPs were the most common colours. Fish length (ρ= -0.09, p=0.09) or weight (ρ=0.07, p=0.18) did not significantly correlate to MP abundance in fish (Spearman rank correlations). Neither MP occurrence nor abundance was linked to MP concentrations in either surface waters or seabed sediments (Spearman rank correlation), but MPs in the fish better reflected MPs in the sediment compared to surface water (two-way ANOVA on ranked data). Whilst L. harak presents as a promising candidate to monitor MP pollution along the East African coast due to its ecology, overall, it lacks reliability. Nonetheless, the present study fills important knowledge gaps both geographically on the East African Coast and with an underrepresented taxonomic family (Lethrinidae ‘Emporer fishes’). © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Our comparative assessment is the first study to investigate microplastic body burden in native (Cambarus appalachiensis) and non-native (Faxonius cristavarius) crayfish along a semi-rural and urban stream across different seasons. Crayfish, sediment, and surface water were collected, processed, and characterized using μRaman spectroscopy to compare microplastic polymer types and shapes across compartments. Average surface water concentrations were significantly higher in our urban stream compared to our semi-rural stream (17.3 ± 2.4 particles/L and 9.9 ± 1.3 particles/L, respectively; P = 0.015). Average sediment concentrations were similar between urban and semi-rural streams (140 ± 14.5 particles/kg and 139 ± 22.5 particles/kg, respectively; P = 0.957). Our findings showed a significant interactive effect of season, site, and nativity (i.e., species) regarding microplastic body burden in crayfish (P = 0.004). The smaller, non-native crayfish amassed more microplastic particles than the native crayfish (0.4–2.0 particles/g versus 0.4–0.8 particles/g, respectively). Fibers and fragments were the most common polymer shapes across compartments, with white and black being the dominant particle colors. Our study identified 13 plastic polymer types in crayfish and three in surface water and sediment; polypropylene was the most common polymer across compartments. This study provides evidence that crayfish body burden of microplastics can differ across species, seasons, and locations, highlighting the need for future studies to consider that sublethal impacts associated with microplastic body burden may vary by region and species. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The presence of nanoplastics (NPs) in wastewater poses a considerable risk to ecosystems. Although constructed wetlands (CWs) have the potential to removal NPs, their efficiency is limited by insufficient consideration of ecosystem integrity. Herein, three typical benthic fauna (Corbicula fluminea, Chironomus riparius and Tubifex tubifex) were added to CWs to improve the ecological integrity of CWs, and further enhance the ecological benefits. Results indicated that the addition of C. fluminea, C. riparius and T. tubifex increased NPs removal by 19.14 %, 17.02 %, and 15.76 % than that without benthic faunas, respectively. Based on fluorescence signal analysis, the presence of benthic fauna could intake NPs, and enhanced the adsorption of NPs by plants. The addition of C. fluminea significantly increased catalase (1541.82 ± 41.35 U/g), glutathione S-transferase (0.34 ± 0.02 U/g), and superoxide dismutase (116.33 ± 6.91 U/g) activities (p < 0.05) as a defense mechanism against NPs-induced oxidative stress. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the abundances of key enzymes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and polystyrene metabolism pathways were increased when C. fluminea was added, corresponding to the microbial degradation of NPs. Overall, the results of this study implied that the benthic fauna can efficiently remove NPs from wastewater in CWs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marine plastic debris (MPD) is a potential threat to marine ecosystems, but its function as a vector for the transportation of harmful microalgae and its impact on the habitats of other marine organisms are uncertain. To address this gap in knowledge, we performed month-long experiments in 30 L microcosms that contained plates made of six different plastic polymers (polypropylene [PP], low-density polyethylene [LDPE], high-density polyethylene [HDPE], polyvinyl chloride [PVC], polyethylene terephthalate [PET], and polystyrene [PS]), and examined the time course of changes in planktonic and periphytic microalgae. There were no significant differences in the composition of periphytic microalgae or biomass among the different plastic polymers (p > 0.05). Nutrient depletion decreased the abundance of planktonic microalgae, but increased the biomass of attached periphytic microalgae (p < 0.05). In particular, analysis of the plastic plates showed that the abundance of benthic species that are responsible for harmful algal blooms (HABs), such as Amphidinium operculatum and Coolia monotis, significantly increased over time (days 21–28; p < 0.05). Our findings demonstrated that periphyton species, including benthic microalgae that cause HABs, can easily attach to different types of plastic and potentially spread to different regions and negatively impact these ecosystems. These observations have important implications for understanding the potential role of MPD in the spread of microalgae, including HABs, which pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are particles with sizes of ≤5 mm formed when plastic materials break down. These contaminants are often found in marine environments, making it easy for sea turtles to ingest them and for their microbiome to be exposed. MPs can disrupt microbiome balance, leading to dysbiosis and making organisms more susceptible to diseases. Owing to the significance of these processes, it is crucial to dedicate research to studying the metabolic and genetic analysis of the gut microbiome in sea turtles. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of exposure to MPs on the gut microbiome of sea turtles, based on current knowledge. This review also aimed to explore the potential link between MP exposure and disease susceptibility in these animals. We show that the metabolites produced by the gut microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), polyamines, and polysaccharide A, can regulate the expression of host genes. Regulation occurs through various mechanisms, including histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and the modulation of cytokine gene expression. These processes are essential for preserving the integrity of the gut mucosa and enhancing the functionality of immune cells. Exposure to MPs disrupts the gut microbiome and alters gene expression, leading to immune system disturbances in sea turtles. This vulnerability makes turtles more susceptible to opportunistic microorganisms such as chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChAHV5), which is linked to the development of fibropapillomatosis (FP). Additionally, targeted dietary interventions or the use of live microorganisms such as probiotics can help restore microbial biodiversity and recover lost metabolic pathways. The goal of these interventions is to restore the functionality of the immune system in sea turtles undergoing rehabilitation at specialized centers. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in sea turtle health, sparking discussions and investigations that can potentially lead to promising treatments for these animals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are pervasive across ecosystems, presenting substantial risks to human health. Developing a comprehensive review of MPs is crucial due to the growing evidence of their widespread presence and potential harmful effects. Despite the growth in research, considerable uncertainties persist regarding their transport dynamics, prevalence, toxicological impacts, and the potential long-term health effects they may cause. This review thoroughly evaluates recent advancements in research on MPs and their implications for human health, including estimations of human exposure through ingestion, inhalation, and skin contact. It also quantifies the distribution and accumulation of MPs in various organs and tissues. The review discusses the mechanisms enabling MPs to cross biological barriers and the role of particle size in their translocation. To ensure methodological rigor, this review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines, explicitly detailing the literature search strategy, inclusion criteria, and the quality assessment of selected studies. The review concludes that MPs pose significant toxicological risks, identifies critical gaps in current knowledge, and recommends future research directions to elucidate the prolonged effects of MPs on human health. This work aims to offer a scientific framework for mitigating MP-related hazards and establishes a foundation for ongoing investigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " From 2019 to 2060, the amount of plastic accumulated in the aquatic environment is expected to increase from 140 million tons to 493 million tons. The continuous release of microplastics (MPs) into the environment has negatively impacted aquatic ecosystems. MPs tend to develop biofilms on their surface in natural waters, and this new micro-ecosystem created by man-made plastic pollution is called plastisphere. The biofilm modifies the migration, transformation and fate, biological effects, and degradation processes of MPs. Although there have been numerous studies on MP biofilm, most focus on microbial diversity and structure. In addition, there are relatively few comprehensive descriptions of biofilm formation and research methods. In this paper, we review the recent works on microbes in the plastisphere, describe microbial interactions in the plastisphere, and examine the research methods, their benefits, and drawbacks concerning MP biofilms, and the four primary environmental factors (nutrient conditions, water temperature, the flow state of water, salinity) that influence microbial colonization. Next, we illustrate the whole process of how microorganisms colonize the MP surface. Finally, we study the microbial community of plastisphere in freshwater, marine, and wetland environments, and provide an outlook for future biofilm research on MPs.

       " Background: Plastics pollution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are two major environmental threats, but potential connections between plastic associated biofilms, the ‘plastisphere’, and dissemination of AMR genes are not well explored. Results: We conducted mesocosm experiments tracking microbial community changes on plastic surfaces transitioning from wastewater effluent to marine environments over 16 weeks. Commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) incubated in wastewater effluent, river water, estuarine water, and in the seawater for 16 weeks, were analysed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Within one week, plastic-colonizing communities shifted from wastewater effluent-associated microorganisms to marine taxa, some members of which (e.g. Oleibacter-Thalassolituus and Sphingomonas spp., on PET, Alcanivoracaceae on PET and PP, or Oleiphilaceae, on all polymers), were selectively enriched from levels undetectable in the starting communities. Remarkably, microbial biofilms were also susceptible to parasitism, with Saprospiraceae feeding on biofilms at late colonisation stages (from week 6 onwards), while Bdellovibrionaceae were prominently present on HDPE from week 2 and LDPE from day 1. Relative AMR gene abundance declined over time, and plastics did not become enriched for key AMR genes after wastewater exposure. Conclusion: Although some resistance genes occurred during the mesocosm transition on plastic substrata, those originated from the seawater organisms. Overall, plastic surfaces incubated in wastewater did not act as hotspots for AMR proliferation in simulated marine environments. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics are a very complex, diverse, and persistent contaminant class in aquatic ecosystems, providing significant challenges for scientists in developing analytical methodologies, fate and transport models, identification of exposure routes, and toxicological risk evaluation are all key difficulties for scientists. Despite a considerable and developing body of thought concerning the effects of microplastics on aquatic species, nothing is known about the effects of microplastics on humans. Microplastics have been found in food all across the world. As a result, human exposure to microplastics through tainted food is unavoidable, possibly creating health risks. In recent years, a major research effort has added to our understanding, but there is an urgent need to simplify and integrate the findings. This review focuses on the effects of microplastics as well as methods for decomposing plastics without creating microplastic particles. Among the various plastic breakdown methods, employing microorganisms and nanotechnology might be a long-term solution in preventing environmental microplastic contamination. © 2024, The Author(s).,\n",
       " Microplastic exposure can cause a range of negative effects on the biochemistry, condition and ecology of freshwater fishes depending on aspects of the exposure and the exposed fish. However, fishes are typically exposed to microplastics and additional multiple stressors simultaneously, for which the combined effects are poorly understood and may have important management consequences. Additive effects are those where the combined effect is equal to the sum, antagonistic where combined effects are less than the sum and for synergistic effects the combined effect is greater to the sum of the individual effects. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of studies recording freshwater fish responses to microplastic-stressor exposures to test if interactions were primarily non-additive (synergistic or antagonistic), and factors impacting the net response. Individual responses were classified (antagonistic/additive/synergistic) and the fit of net responses to a null additive model determined for 838 responses (36 studies) split by categorical variables for the microplastic exposure (environmental relevance, interacting stressor, microplastic morphology and response category measured), as well as the exposed fish (lifestage, ecology and family). Most responses were classified as antagonistic (48 %) and additive (34 %), with synergistic effects least frequent (17 %). Net responses fitted null additive models for all levels of interacting stressor, fish family and microplastic morphology. In contrast, net antagonism was present for biochemical responses, embryo lifestages, environmentally relevant microplastic exposures and fish with benthopelagic ecology, while synergism was identified for fishes with demersal ecology. While substantial knowledge gaps remain and are discussed, the data thus far suggest microplastic-stressor responses in freshwater fishes are rarely synergistic and, therefore, addressing either or both stressors will likely result in positive management and biological outcomes. © 2024,\n",
       " As a critical source of marine microplastics (MPs), estuarine MPs community varied in movement due to particle diversity, while tide and runoff further complicated their transport. In this study, a particle mass gradient that represents MPs in the surface layer of the Yangtze River estuary was established. This was done by calculating the masses of 16 particle types using the particle size probability density function (PDF), with typical shapes and polymers as classifiers. Further, Aschenbrenner shape factor and polymer density were embedded into drag coefficients to categorically trace MP movement footprints. Results revealed that the MPs in North Branch moved northward and the MPs in South Branch moved southeastward in a spiral oscillation until they left the model boundary under Changjiang Diluted Water front and the northward coastal currents. Low-density fibrous MPs are more likely to move into the open ocean and oscillate more than films, with a single PE fiber trajectory that reached a maximum oscillatory width of 16.7 km. Over 95 % of the PVC fiber particles settled in nearshore waters west of 122.5°E. Elucidating the aggregation and retention of different MPs types can provide more accurate environmental baseline reference for more precise MP exposure levels and risk dose of ingestion for marine organisms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Sundarban, a Ramsar site of India, has been encountering an ecological threat due to the presence of microplastic (MP) wastes generated from different anthropogenic sources. Clibanarius longitarsus, an intertidal hermit crab of Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, resides within the abandoned shell of a gastropod mollusc, Telescopium telescopium. We characterized and estimated the MP in the gills and gut of hermit crab, as well as in the water present in its occupied gastropod shell. The average microplastic abundance in sea water, sand and sediment were 0.175 ± 0.145 MP L−1, 42 ± 15.03 MP kg−1 and 67.63 ± 24.13 MP kg−1 respectively. The average microplastic load in hermit crab was 1.94 ± 0.59 MP crab−1, with 33.89 % and 66.11 % in gills and gut respectively. Gastropod shell water exhibited accumulation of 1.69 ± 1.43 MP L−1. Transparent and fibrous microplastics were documented as the dominant polymers of water, sand and sediment. Shell water exhibited the prevalence of green microplastics followed by transparent ones. Microscopic examination revealed microplastics with 100–300 μm size categories were dominant across all abiotic compartments. ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy confirmed polyethylene and polypropylene as the prevalent polymers among the five identified polymers of biotic and abiotic components. The target group index indicated green and black as the preferable microplastics of crab. The ecological risk analysis indicated a considerable level of environmental pollution risk in Sundarban and its inhabiting organisms. This important information base may facilitate in developing a strategy of mitigation to limit the MP induced ecological risk at Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Nanoplastics (<1 μm) can serve as a transport vector of environmental pollutants (e.g., heavy metals) and change their toxicities and bioavailabilities. Up to date the behaviors of adsorption and desorption heavy metals on/off nanoplastics are largely unknown. Herein, polymeric membrane potentiometric ion sensors are proposed for in-situ assessment of the real-time kinetics of heavy metal adsorption and desorption on/off nanoplastics. Results show that nanoplastics can adsorb and release heavy metals in a fast manner, indicating their superior ability in transferring heavy metals. The adsorption behaviors are closely related to the characteristics of nanoplastics and background electrolytes. Particle aggregation and increases in salinity and acidity suppress the adsorption of heavy metals on nanoplastics. The desorption efficiencies of different heavy metals are Pb2+ (31 %) < Cu2+ (40 %) < Cd2+ (97 %). Our proposed method is applicable for the detection of the plastic pollutants with size <100 nm and of the samples with high salinities (e.g., seawater). This work would provide new insights into the assessment of environmental risks posed by nanoplastics and heavy metals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Seagrass, a key component of marine environments, can also act as a conduit for microplastics (< 5 mm) into the food web. In this pioneering study, we investigated the occurrence of microplastics on seagrass blades in the Philippines for the first time. Our research focused on Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata in Buru-un, Iligan City; and Enhalus acoroides and Halodule uninervis in Tubajon, Laguindingan. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, we identified 53 particles as microplastics. Microplastic density ranged from 0.054 ±0.061 n/cm2 to 0.255 ±0.306 n/cm2, with C. rotundata exhibiting the highest density. Poly(methyl methacrylate) particles were the most prevalent in all four seagrass species. This study presents the first scientific literature on microplastics found on seagrass blades in the Philippines. It underscores the necessity for immediate and ongoing microplastic monitoring in biota and other seagrass components to trace microplastic pathways in the marine food web, highlighting the urgent need to address this issue. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic ingestion poses a significant concern for a plethora of marine organisms due to its widespread presence in marine ecosystems. Despite growing scientific interest, the effects on marine biota are not yet well understood. This study investigates the ingestion of microplastics (MPs) by mussels from various marine environments and assesses the associated effects that can be induced by MPs and associated toxic chemicals. Biomarkers of oxidative stress (catalase, lipid peroxidation), biotransformation (glutathione S-transferase), genotoxicity (micronuclei frequency) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase) were employed. Mussels, considered reliable bioindicators of MPs pollution, were sampled by hand from diverse locations under varied anthropogenic pressures, including a highly touristic Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Ionian Sea, a mussel farm and a fish farm in the Aegean Sea. The results revealed the highest MP ingestion in mussels from the fish farm [0.21 ± 0.04 (SE) MPs/g or 0.63 ± 0.12 (SE) MPs/Ind.], likely due to plastic aquaculture equipment use. Stereoscopic observation revealed fibers, as the predominant shape of ingested MPs across all sites, and μFTIR polymer identification revealed the presence of various types, with polyethylene (PE) and polyamide (PA) being the most abundant. Significant physiological alterations in mussels related to MP ingestion levels were observed through biomarkers indicative of oxidative stress and biotransformation, as well as the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR index). However, laboratory experiments with mussels exposed to controlled increasing PE concentrations for four weeks, did not show significant effects triggered by the PE ingestion, possibly indicating other environmental factors, such as contaminants from aquaculture environments, may influence biomarker levels in the field. Despite the observed effects, MP ingestion rates in mussels from the field were relatively low compared to other studies. Future research should continue to investigate the interactions between MPs and marine organisms in diverse environments to better understand and mitigate their impacts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Background: Nanoplastics (NPs) are now a new class of pollutants widely present in the soil, atmosphere, freshwater and marine environments. Nanoplastics can rapidly penetrate cell membranes and accumulate in human tissues and organs, thus posing a potential threat to human health. The heart is the main power source of the body. But up to now, the toxicological effects of long-term exposure to nanoplastics on the heart has not been revealed yet. Results: We evaluated the effects of long term exposure of nanoplastics on cardiac cell/tissue in vitro and in vivo model. Furthermore, we explored the molecular mechanism by which nanoplastics exposure causes myocardial cell senescence. Immunohistochemistry, indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA were performed to detect the effects of nanoplastics on heart aging. We found that nanoplastics were able to induce significant cardiac aging through a series of biochemical assays in vivo. In vitro, the effects of nanoplastics on cardiac cell were investigated, and found that nanoplastics were able to internalize into cardiomyocytes in time and dose-dependant manner. Further biochemical analysis showed that nanoplastics induces cardiomyocytes senescence by detecting a series of senescence marker molecules. Molecular mechanism research shows that nanoplastics may cause mitochondrial destabilization by inducing oxidative stress, which leads to the leakage of mtDNA from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, and then cytoplasm-localized mt-DNA activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and promotes inflammation response, ultimately inducing cardiomyocytes senescence. Conclusions: In this work, we found that nanoplastics exposure induces premature aging of heart. Current research also reveals the molecular mechanism by which nanoplastics induces cardiomyocyte senescence. This study laid the foundation for further studying the potential harm of nanoplastics exposure on heart. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " For the first time, combined detection and simulation was performed on microplastic (MP) debris in surface water, sediment, and oyster samples at ten coastal sites of Shing Mun River estuary, Hong Kong at different tidal conditions. The MP debris were extracted and detected using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and the simulation was conducted using Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRF) / Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) coupled hydro-dynamic modelling and the subsequent Lagrangian particle tracking. The results demonstrated the majority of polyethylene (with partial chlorine substitution) debris among all the MPs found, and great spatial and tidal variabilities of MP concentrations were observed. The combination of MP observation and simulations referred to the interpretation that a considerable percentage of MPs found in this study originated from South China Sea. Those MPs were probably transported to Tolo Harbour through sea currents and drifted inshore and offshore with tides. This study provided baseline measures of MP concentrations in Shing Mun River estuary and comprehensive understanding for how MPs transport and distribute within a dynamic estuarine system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are concerning emerging pollutants. Here, MPs in four edible aquatic species of different trophic levels (between ∼2 and 4), including fish species Esox lucius (Esocidae: Esocinae); Cyprinus carpio (Cyprinidae: Cyprininae); and Luciobarbus caspius (Cyprinidae: Barbinae); and the swan mussel Anodonta cygnea (Unionidae), were assessed in the Anzali freshwater ecosystem. It is a listed wetland in the Montreux record. MPs were extracted from gastrointestinal tracts (GI), gills, muscles, and skin. All the studied fish and mussels (n = 33) had MPs. MP fibres, fragments and sheets were detected in every GI examined, however, fibres were the only type of MPs in skins, muscles and gills and were the most abundant MP. The MPs found in the fish and mussels were mainly made of nylon (35% of the total MPs), polypropylene-low density polyethylene (30%), and polycarbonate (25%). The average numbers of MPs found in every fish specimen, expressed per wet body mass, had a moderate negative correlation with the condition factor (K) (MP/g - K: Pearson correlation r = −0.413, p = 0.049), and there was no significant relation with the growth factor (b) (r = −0.376; p = 0.068). Importantly, Luciobarbus caspius (with trophic level 2.7–2.8) bioaccumulated MPs and presented a strong correlation between their MP contamination and age (r = 0.916 p < 0.05). Greater gill mass (or related factors) played an important role in the accumulation of MPs, and there was a strong correlation between these factors for Esox lucius and Cyprinus carpio (r = 0.876; r = 0.846; p < 0.05 respectively). The highest MP/g gills (1.91 ± 2.65) were in the filter feeder Anodonta cygnea inhabiting the benthic zone. Esox lucius (piscivorous, trophic level 4.1) was the most contaminated species overall (a total of 83 MPs in 8 individuals, with 0.92 MP/g fish), and their gills where MPs mainly accumulated. Cyprinus carpio was the most contaminated specimen (MPs in specimens), while the number of MPs per mass unit increased with the trophic level. Their feeding and ecological behavior in the aquatic habitat affected the level of accumulation. This work includes evidence of translocation of MPs within the aquatic organisms. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) release into the terrestrial environment has occurred since humans started manufacturing and using plastics. These tiny plastic particles can be found in various media, including the atmosphere, soil, freshwater, sediments, and organisms. MPs migrate through terrestrial environmental media due to wind, water, gravity, and biological processes. Although the variables that affect the migration process have been investigated in various settings, the mechanisms of MP migration in terrestrial environments have yet to be systematically characterized. This study classifies the migration mechanisms of MPs as physical, chemical and biological manners, and discusses the factors affecting migration mechanisms in dynamic factors, environmental factors and MP characteristics. Examining the action mechanisms of migration can establish a foundation for understanding the migration processes of MPs and provide a theoretical framework for modeling MP movement in environmental. Future research challenges include understanding the effect of MP characteristics in the migration process and simulating the migration of MPs in the environment in the long-term. Exploring the MP migration on various spatial and temporal scales, considering the life cycle of MPs is a worthy research direction. © 2024 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.,\n",
       " Intertidal fishes have received a great deal of attention in last decades serving as a sound study model in marine ecology. They occupy habitats that are readily subject to human alteration. In this review, the state of the art of research on the ecology of intertidal fishes along the coast the Southeastern Pacific Ocean (Colombia, Ecuador, Perú and Chile) is presented and discussed, highlighting topics such as diversity, trophic ecology, behavioral ecology, parasitology, biogeography, pollution, and conservation, with the goal of identifying general gaps and areas in need of further attention. The analysis was conducted by assessing studies indexed on the ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar databases until March, 2023. A total of 94 studies were found in the surveyed databases, most of them carried out along the Chilean coast. A total of 137 species of intertidal fishes belonging to 47 families and 12 orders has been reported so far along the coast of Southeastern Pacific Ocean, being Labrisomidae, Pomacentridae, Notothenidae, Gobiesocidae, Gobidae, and Muraenidae the most common families. Large spatial and temporal variability are key characteristics of fish assemblages, which seem to be highly influenced the intensity of ENSO events. Trophically speaking, intertidal fish species are primarily carnivorous, feeding almost exclusively on benthic invertebrates, being small mobile crustaceans, particularly amphipods, isopods, decapods and copepods, the predominant prey items in their diets. Physiologically, new evidence suggests processes of local adaptation, rather than plasticity in thermoregulatory and energetic mechanisms. A total of 40 parasite species belonging to Trematoda, Nematoda, Acanthocephala, Cestoda, Annelida and Copepoda have been reported among intertidal fish species, being copepods and trematodes the commonest. Pelagic larval duration have been observed to vary from 45 to 120 days for 14 species of intertidal rocky fishes, which correspond to comparatively longer periods than those of their counterparts in tropical and warmer-temperate waters. The following three biogeographic provinces exist along the Southeastern Pacific coast, presenting taxonomic compositional differences in intertidal fishes: the tropical Panamanian Province, the warm-temperate Peruvian-Chilean Province, and the Magellan Province. Geographically, there are more species in the tropics than in temperate latitudes. Microplastic fibers and coastal artificial light have been reported to be the major sources of pollution in intertidal fishes. Even though intertidal reef habitats are the most impacted ecosystems in the marine realm, there are still no conservation and management strategies in place to protect these particular environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), omnipresent contaminants in the ocean, could be carried by seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers, which might affect the fate of heavy metals existing in aquifers. Herein, we investigated the release behavior of arsenic (As) in coastal aquifers during MPs-containing seawater intrusion by applying laboratory experiment and numerical simulation. We found that seawater with marine MPs enhanced the release of As in aquifers, especially for dissolved As(V) and colloidal As. Negatively charged MPs competed with As(V) for the adsorption sites on iron (hydr)oxides in aquifers, resulting in the desorption of As(V). In addition, MPs could promote the release of Fe-rich colloids by imparting negative charge to its surface and providing it with sufficient repulsive force to detach from the matrix, thereby leading to the release of As associated with Fe-rich colloid. We also developed a modeling approach that well described the transport of As in coastal aquifer under the impact of MPs, which coupled variable density flow and kinetically controlled colloids transport with multicomponent reactive transport model. Our findings elucidated the enhancement of MPs on the release of As in aquifers during seawater intrusion, which provides new insights into the risk assessment of MPs in coastal zones. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " In recent years, the problem of global warming has become increasingly serious. Other problems such as marine pollution are also of concern with regard to environmental loads. These problems create serious ecological imbalances, and human health may be harmed. Fish, turtles, and other creatures in the ocean are also seriously threatened. In addition, marine debris negatively impacts the economy and destroys the recreational quality of beaches, making it one of the most pressing environmental problems globally. In Taiwan, research on marine debris is scarce; hence, it is necessary to collect reliable data through a standardized process and gather data collected from different periods, sea areas, and fishing vessels for overall analysis. This research uses the sbPOM ocean model. sbPOM is based on the parallelized ocean model developed by Stony Brook University in 2012 under the POM architecture. The simulation time is selected from July 1, 2022, to August 31, 2022, and the simulation and verification data range is 116°–127° east longitude and 17.5°–28.5° north latitude (middle area). Correlated with the observation data of the Central Meteorological Bureau of Taiwan and the model water flow, the comparison results were consistent and good. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Nature B.V. 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic-containing waste generated from industrial and household activities is usually discharged into rivers. Pekalongan Regency has several rivers that flow into the Java Sea, one of which is the Sengkarang River. Microplastic is a serious pollutant that has prompted enhanced research and experimentation. This study aims to determine the concentration and distribution of microplastics in water and sediment at the mouth of the Sengkarang River, Pekalongan. A total of 10 water samples and five sediment samples were collected from the river body to the deep water area around the Sengkarang River. Modeling of microplastic distribution is made using hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking models using two-dimensional mathematical model. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics ranged from 131 to 360 particle/m3 in water samples and 552.5–972.5 particle/kg in sediment samples. The most common types of microplastics found were fibers and fragments. The greatest abundance and distribution of microplastics are found in coastal areas in water samples and mangrove areas in sediment samples. The distribution of microplastics is influenced by tidal currents, wind directions, and also river water discharge. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) residues in marine have become an increasingly serious environmental pollution issue, and in recent years the detection of MPs in marine started to attract worldwide research interests. Optical-fiber-based environmental sensors have been extensively employed for their several merits such as high sensitivity, pressure resistance, compactness and ease of constructing communication networks. However, fiber-optic refractive index sensors are not specifically developed for distinguishing MPs from other inorganic particles suspended in water. In this paper, an metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 functionalized S-tapered fiber (STF) sensor is proposed for specific detection of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) in aqueous environment. ZIF-8 coordination nanoporous polymers with different film thickness were immobilized over the surface of the fabricated STF structure based on self-growth technique and yielding a large surface area over the sensor surface. High sensitivity detection can be achieved by converting the concentration perturbation of PSNPs into evanescent waves over the ZIF-8 functionalized STF surface through the strong electrostatic adsorption effect and π-π stacking, while the fabricated sensor is insensitive to gravels with silica as the primary component in water. It is found that the proposed detector with 18 film layers achieves a sensitivity up to 114.1353nm/%(w/v) for the PSNPs concentration range of 0.01 %(w/v) to 0.08 %(w/v). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Globally plastic pollution is posing a significant threat to the health and integrity of coastal ecosystems. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of plastic pollution in the coastal areas of Bangladesh by examining land-based macroplastic distribution, exploring microplastic (MP) contamination in the coastal aquatic ecosystem and enhancing our understanding of the potential risks associated with MP contamination. Citizen science based monitoring approach using the android application was applied to understand the land-based plastic pollution in the coastal area of Bangladesh. From December 2022 to December 2023, a total of about 3600 photographs of plastic items from 215 citizen scientists were received from the coastal area of Bangladesh covering 580 km long coast line. Polymer Hazard Index (PHI) and Pollution Load Index (PLI) were also calculated to understand the risk of plastic pollution in sediment, water, aquatic organism, dried fish and sea salt. A total of 43 land-based plastic items reported from the coastal area of Bangladesh. Among these plastic items single use items contributed 58.2 % while disposable plastic items contributed 41.8 %. A strong spatial variability in the distribution of these plastic items was observed. PHI and PLI values suggested hazard category-I for MP contamination in sediment, sea salt, water, commercial fishery resources and dry fish. This study highlighted that coastal land area, sea salt, dried fish, water, sediment and organisms are contaminated with plastics which might have the potential threats to human health. Findings from this study will serve as reference data and also baseline for future research to combat the plastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics pollution threatens to marine organisms, particularly bivalves that actively ingest and accumulate microplastics of certain sizes, potentially disrupting intestinal homeostasis. This study investigated the microplastic abundance in wild and farmed mussels around Singapore, and examined the size-dependent effects of nano- to micro-scale polystyrene (0.5 µm/5 µm/50 µm) on the mussel intestinal microbiome in the laboratory. The field investigation revealed higher microplastic abundance in farmed mussels compared to wild ones. Experimentally, mussels exposed to 0.6 mg/L of microplastics for 7 days, followed by a 7-day depuration period, showed substantial impacts on Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria, facilitating the proliferation of pathogenic species and differentially affecting their pathogenic contributions. Metagenomics analysis revealed that microplastic exposure reduced Spirochaeta's contribution to virulence and pathogenicity loss, did not affect Vibrio and Oceanispirochaeta's pathogenicity, and increased Treponema and Oceanispirochaeta's contributions to pathogenicity loss. Moreover, microplastics increased transmembrane transporters and impacted oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, impairing energy metabolism. These effects persisted after depuration, indicating lack of resilience in the microbiome. Nano- and micro-scale plastics perturbed the mussel microbiome composition and functions in a size-dependent manner, with nano-plastics being the most disruptive. The increasing use and sale of aquaculture equipment of plastic may exacerbate the intestinal dysbiosis in bivalves, which threatens consumers' health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Oil spill and microplastic (MP) pollution are the main problems in the marine environment. After an oil spill, the oil film may be dispersed into the water column in the form of droplets under the action of ocean waves. In this study, the sea condition was simulated through the batch conical flask oscillation experiment. Merey crude oil was selected as experimental oil, and polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) were used as experimental MP. The effects of MP properties (type, concentration and size) on the dispersion of spilled oil were investigated. It is found that for each MP, the oil dispersion efficiency (ODE) increased rapidly at first and then tended to be stable, which all reached the maximum at 360 min. When the concentrations of PE and PS increased from 0 to 100 mg/L, the maximum ODE decreased from 32.64 % to 13.72 % and 10.75 %, respectively, indicating that the presence of MP inhibits the oil dispersion. At the same oscillation time, the volumetric mean diameter (VMD) of dispersed oil increased with the MP concentration. When the particle size of PE and PS increased from 13 to 1000 μm, the maximum ODE increased from 24.74 % to 31.49 % and 28.60 %, respectively. However, the VMD decreased with the size of MP. In addition, the time series of the oil adsorption rate by the MP were well fitted by the kinetic models. The results of this research deepen the understanding of the migration law of spilled oil to the marine environment in the presence of MP, and may further improve the ability of marine environmental scientists to predict the fate of oil spill. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Recent scientific investigations have highlighted concerning levels of microplastic contamination in marine ecosystems, posing significant risks to marine organisms and human populations. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of microplastics in water, sediment, and tissues of commercially important fish species along the Malabar coast in Northwest Kerala, India. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), six predominant polymer types were identified, including HDPE, PET, and nylon. The investigation revealed notable abundances of transparent microplastic particles, measuring <1 mm in diameter, particularly in gastrointestinal and gill tissues, with gastrointestinal tissues exhibiting the highest concentration of microplastics. A diverse array of morphotypes, including fragments (48.08%), fibers (28.84%), filaments (19.23%), and granules (3.85%), were observed within the coastal zone. The study implicates various sources of contamination, such as direct discharges, runoff, and inadequate wastewater management practices, contributing to the substantial presence of microplastics in coastal environments. In light of these findings, the study emphasizes the urgent need for the implementation of effective regulatory measures to mitigate plastic pollution in marine ecosystems. These results underscore the critical importance of proactive intervention to safeguard the health of marine ecosystems and human populations in coastal regions. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), as a new type of environmental pollutant, have attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, there has been relatively little research specifically focusing on MPs in the Yellow River Basin, China, particularly regarding MP migration patterns. Based on surface water and sediment samples from 19 sampling sites in the Wuding River (WDR), the abundances and characteristic distributions of MPs were analyzed, and the environmental factors affecting their distribution and potential ecological risks were evaluated. The results showed that the MP abundances in surface water and sediments of the WDR were significantly different (P < 0.05), with mean values of 2.98 ± 0.69 items/L and 419.47 ± 75.61 items/kg, respectively. In terms of MP characteristics, the most common size class was 0.1–0.5 mm in surface water. Polyethylene (PE, 32.50%) and polypropylene (PP, 27.50%) were the main polymer types of MPs in surface water. Although similar MP characteristics were observed in sediments, there were significantly more particles in the <0.1 mm particle size (P < 0.05), which was 15.0% higher than in surface water. Also, more high-density MP fragments were observed in sediment samples. The retention of MPs in sediments was influenced by the MP characteristics (density, shape, particle size) and sediment particle size. In contrast, the MP abundance in surface water was more closely related to the presence of other environmental pollutants, such as total phosphorus (WTP) and ammonia nitrogen (WAN). Temperature (T), agricultural land (AGR), and residential land (RES) only had significant effects on the distribution of MPs in surface water (P < 0.05). Potential ecological risk assessments revealed that MP pollution in sediments was more serious than in surface water, especially in the middle and lower reaches. The results of this study are important for understanding MP transport in a sandy river and for eliminating potential sources of MPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and okadaic acid (OA) are known to coexist in marine organisms, potentially impacting humans through food chain. However, the combined toxicity of OA and MPs remains unknown. In this study, mice were orally administered OA at 200 μg/kg bw and MPs at 2 mg/kg bw. The co-exposure group showed a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content and significant decreases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) level compared to the control, MPs and OA groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, the co-exposure group exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-1β and IL-18 compared to other groups (p < 0.05). These results demonstrated that co-exposure to MPs and OA induces oxidative stress and exacerbates inflammation. Histological and cellular ultrastructure analyses suggested that this combined exposure may enhance gut damage and compromise barrier integrity. Consequently, the concentration of OA in the small intestine of the co-exposure group was significantly higher than that in the OA group. Furthermore, MPs were observed in the lamina propria of the gut in the co-exposure group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the co-exposure led to increased expression of certain genes related to the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway compared to the OA and MPs groups. Overall, this combined exposure may disrupt the intestinal barrier, and promote inflammation through the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. These findings provide precious information for the understanding of health risks associated with MPs and phycotoxins. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This paper presents the results of a research aimed at establishing a novel method for the detection of primary and secondary micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), by using the fluorescence properties of the dye Nile Red-n-heptane (NR-H). The method has been applied to the detection of laboratory degraded polymers (Polystyrene, PS and Polyethylene Terephthalate, PET) as well as traceable latex microspheres in aqueous environments, showing a remarkable detection capacity and avoiding the prior extraction or processing of MNPs in natural samples, with significant time savings compared to conventional methods. The study has been carried out on various types of water, including samples from wastewater treatment plants, boreholes, seawater and synthesized seawater. The effectiveness of the staining process was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and optical microscopy. As a result, a novel standardizable protocol for the rapid detection of MNPs has been established, with the potential to improve environmental protection through fast in-situ detection and identification of plastic contaminants. The limitations of the protocol in the quantification of MNPs have also been identified and further studies are proposed to overcome these limitations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This paper uses a particle tracking model to simulate the distribution of fishing-related marine-sourced plastic litter from demersal trawling activities along the Atlantic coast of Scotland. The modelled fishing litter dispersed widely across the region, with ∼50% of the particles beaching along the northwestern Scottish coast after a year-long simulation. The model was tuned using observations of beached litter loadings along the same coastline to estimate the annual input, by mass, of small (<1 kg) plastic litter. Model results suggest that between 107 g and 280 g of small fishing-related litter enters the ocean per hour of fishing, resulting in an estimated 234 t to 614 t of small fishing-related litter entering the ocean annually on the Scottish west coast. These results suggest that fishing on the Atlantic coast of Scotland may be a significant source of marine plastic. However, more modelled and observational data are required to reduce uncertainty. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Marine litter and non-degradable plastic pollution is of global concern. Regular monitoring programs are being established to assess and understand the scale of this pollution. In Europe, the goal of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is to assess trends in Good Environmental Status and support large-scale actions at the regional level. Marine litter monitoring requires tailored sampling strategies, protocols and indicators, that align with specific objectives and are tailored for local or regional needs. In addition, the uneven spatial and temporal distributions of marine litter present a challenge when designing a statistically powerful monitoring program. In this paper, we critically review the existing marine litter monitoring programs in Europe. We discuss the main constraints, including environmental, logistical, scientific, and ethical factors. Additionally, we outline the critical gaps and shortcomings in monitoring MSFD beaches/shorelines, floating litter, seafloor litter, microplastics, and harm. Several priorities must be established to shape the future of monitoring within the MSFD. Recent developments in analytical approaches, including optimizing protocols and sampling strategies, gaining a better understanding of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of litter and its implications for survey design and replication, and the inclusion of newly validated methodologies that have achieved sufficient technical readiness, must be considered. Although there are well-established methods for assessing beaches, floating and seafloor litter, it will be necessary to implement monitoring schemes for microplastics in sediments and invertebrates as robust analytical methods become available for targeting smaller particle size classes. Furthermore, the inclusion of indicators for entanglement and injury to marine organisms will have to be considered in the near future. Moreover, the following actions will enhance the effectiveness of monitoring efforts: (1) creating an inventory of accumulation areas and sources of specific types of litter (e.g., fishing gear), (2) monitoring riverine inputs of litter, (3) monitoring atmospheric inputs including microplastics, (4) accidental inputs during extreme weather events, and (5) studying how species at risk may be transported by litter. We provide recommendations to support long-term, effective, and well-coordinated marine litter monitoring within the MSFD to achieve a comprehensive and accurate understanding of marine litter in EU waters. This will allow the development of measures to mitigate the impacts of marine pollution and eventually to evaluate the success of the respective measures. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study provided a systematic investigation of microplastics in Hong Kong's surface marine waters during the pandemic from 2019 to 2021. Microplastics (2.07 ± 4.00 particles/m3) exhibited significant temporal variations with higher abundance in the wet season, without a consistent trend after the mandatory mask-wearing requirement was announced. The impact of pandemic restrictions on microplastic distribution was found to be relatively minor. However, significant correlations between microplastic abundances and rainfall highlighted the substantial contribution of local emissions through surface runoff. Notably, sites in closer proximity to the Pearl River Delta exhibited higher microplastic abundances, indicating their association with emission sources. The influence of rainfall and adverse weather on marine microplastic loads demonstrated different sensitivities among various locations but can generally last for one month. These results revealed the impact of seasonal rainfall on coastal microplastics and emphasized the need for efforts to reduce microplastic discharge from land-based sources. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " To study multigenerational resilience to high temperature (HT) conditions, we exposed Brachionus plicatilis marine rotifers to HT, high salinity (HS), and nanoplastics (NPs), and measured reproductive and life-cycle endpoints. After exposure to HT, rotifer lifespans were reduced, but daily production of offspring increased. However, both combined HT/HS and HT/HS/NP exposure led to additional decreases in longevity and reproductive ability; the antioxidant defense mechanisms of the rotifers were also notably upregulated as measured by reactive oxygen species levels. Fatty-acid profiles were reduced in all conditions. In multigenerational experiments, the negative effects of HT dissipated rapidly; however, the effects of HT/HS and HT/HS/NPs required four generations to disappear completely. The findings indicated that B. plicatilis were able to recover from these environmental stressors. This study demonstrated the resilience of aquatic organisms in response to changing environmental conditions and provides insights into the complex interactions of different abiotic stressors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Developing superior-performance marine-biodegradable plastics remains a critical challenge in mitigating marine plastic pollution. Commercially available biodegradable polymers, such as poly(L-lactide) (PLA), undergo slow degradation in complex marine environments. This study introduces an innovative bioplastic design that employs a facile ring-opening and coupling reaction to incorporate hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) into PLA, yielding PEG-PLA copolymers with either sequence-controlled alternating or random structures. These materials exhibit exceptional toughness in both wet and dry states, with an elongation at break of 1446.8% in the wet state. Specifically, PEG4kPLA2k copolymer biodegraded rapidly in proteinase K enzymatic solutions and had a significant weight loss of 71.5% after 28 d in seawater. The degradation primarily affects the PLA segments within the PEG-PLA copolymer, as evidenced by structural changes confirmed through comprehensive characterization techniques. The seawater biodegradability, in line with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 306 Marine biodegradation test guideline, reached 72.63%, verified by quantitative biochemical oxygen demand analysis, demonstrating rapid chain scission in marine environments. The capacity of PEG-PLA bioplastic to withstand DI water and rapidly biodegrade in seawater makes it a promising candidate for preventing marine plastic pollution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Due to their location, at the boundary between the marine and terrestrial domain, marine caves are very sensitive to environmental changes, but, at the same time, they are extremely vulnerable due to the enclosed setting. Despite their hostile conditions, they are reservoirs of biodiversity, and there is a need to improve their knowledge for conservation and protection purposes. This research studied sediment characteristics (grain size and organic geochemistry) and benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Argentarola cave (Tuscany, Italy) to define cave ecozones and characterize their environmental variability. Because microplastic pollution is considered a potential threat for the cave, its presence was researched in sediment samples; moreover, the tests of agglutinated foraminifera were analyzed through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to verify the possible inclusion of these contaminants. Result indicated the presence in the whole cave of fine-grained sediment with a low organic matter content of clear marine origin, pointing to oligotrophic conditions. Microplastic items at low concentrations were found in sediments, mainly constituted by very small (0.1–0.5 mm) polyethylene and polypropylene fragments and fibers. Foraminifera were abundant and diversified with dominant Spirillina vivipara and Patellina corrugata, like in other small Mediterranean marine caves. Despite the scarce variability of environmental parameters, foraminifera developed two distinct assemblages in relation to sediment texture and organic matter content. In the relatively more organically enriched one, two agglutinated deep-water species, Lagenammina difflugiformis and Glomospira charoides, never recorded before in marine caves, were common. The first one included polyethylene items among the particles of the agglutinated test. Then, this species may be considered an early indicator of microplastic pollution. However, this pollution did not influence the Ecological Quality Status, which was found to be high to good when applying the Foram-Ambi index. This study constitutes a new approach to studying marine caves, providing new tools for the environmental assessment and microplastic monitoring of this protected habitat. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " pH reduction (Low pH), microplastic (MP), and lanthanum (La) are substantial stressors due to their increasing trends in marine ecosystems and having adverse effects on marine species. This study investigates the single and combined effects of those stressors (Low pH: 7.45, polyethylene MP: 26 μg L−1, and La: 9 μg L−1) on the physiology and histology of sea urchin Arbacia lixula. Regarding physiological results, while the coelomocytes' quantity was slightly affected by stressors, their viability was significantly affected. The coelomocyte count and viability were suppressed most in Low pH-MP-La treatment. The stressors did not impact the respiration rate. According to the histological examination results, the crypt (villi-like structure) was shorter, and epithelial layers were thinner in single and dual stress treatments like MP, Low pH, Low pH-La, and MP-La. Overall, we suggest that the combination of variable types of those stressors causes negative effects on sea urchin's physiology and histology. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The transport of microplastics (MPs) from urban environments to water resources via stormwater runoff poses significant concerns due to its adverse impacts on water safety and aquatic ecosystems. This study presents a modeling approach aimed at understanding the transport mechanisms of MPs in an urban residential setting, considering settling and buoyant MPs. To consider the effect of MP shapes, the settling velocity of various settling MPs in shapes of fibers, films, and fragments was calculated. Using an analogy of sediment transport, a Rouse number criterion was used to analyze the transport of MPs. For buoyant MPs, it was assumed that they transport as wash-load as soon as they float in the water and the travel time for them to reach the storm drain was determined. The calculation of settling velocity revealed the influence of shape on the settling velocity of MPs was particularly pronounced as the equivalent diameter of the MPs increased. The transport mechanism for the smallest settling MPs, irrespective of their shapes, density, and depth of flow, was wash-load. However, for larger MPs, the shape and size distribution of settling MPs, along with the depth of flow and slope significantly influenced their transport mechanisms compared to sediment particles. The influence of weathering on the MPs’ transport mechanisms depended on their sizes and shapes. The site-specific characteristics, including slope and surface friction, significantly influenced the velocity of stormwater runoff and, consequently, the extent of MP transport during rain events. Moreover, an evaluation of the transport mechanism of settling MPs was conducted using the reported field data on MP abundance in road dust collected from residential and traffic sites. This study underscores the complexity of MP transport dynamics and provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate MP pollution in urban environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The presence of plastics in the oceans has already become a pervasive phenomenon. Marine pollution by plastics surpasses the status of an emerging threat to become a well-established environmental problem, boosting research on this topic. However, despite many studies on the main seas and oceans, it is necessary to compile information on the South American Atlantic Ocean Coast to identify the lack of research and expand knowledge on marine plastic pollution in this region. Accordingly, this paper conducted an in-depth review of monitoring methods, sampling, and identification of macroplastics and microplastics (MPs) in water, sediments, and biota, including information on legal requirements from different countries as well as non-governmental initiatives. Brazil was the country with the highest number of published papers, followed by Argentina. MPs accounted for 75 % of the papers selected, with blue microfibers being the most common morphology, whereas PE and PP were the most abundant polymers. Also, a lack of standardization in the methodologies used was identified; however, the sites with the highest concentrations of MPs were the Bahía Blanca Estuary (Argentina), Guanabara Bay (Brazil), and Todos os Santos Bay (Brazil), regardless of the method applied. Regarding legislation, Uruguay and Argentina have the most advanced policies in the region against marine plastic pollution due to their emphasis on the life cycle and the national ban on certain single-use plastics. Therefore, considering its content, this expert review can be useful to assist researchers dealing with plastic pollution along the South American Atlantic Ocean Coast. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marine plastic litter (MPL) was collected from beaches (n = 3) of the Arauco Gulf in central Chile in spring 2021 and summer 2022. MPL was analyzed for physical and chemical characteristics, and plasticizers were also screened using FTIR-ATR. Three hundred seventeen plastic items with an accumulated weight of 226.8 g were found. MPL densities ranged from 0.4 to 17.1 items m−2. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between seasons were observed for Arauco and Maule beaches, being ∼ten times higher in summer compared to spring. Solid pieces were the predominant shape, macroplastics were the most abundant (>2.5 cm), and white and blue colors were dominant. Polypropylene (52 %) and polyethylene (31 %) were the predominant polymers. Plasticizers (n = 3) were detected in the MPL in the study area (dioctyl phthalate, polybutene, and alpha-methylstyrene) for the first time. This study contributes new information related to MPL in coastal areas of central Chile and their chemical composition. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Countries, like Indonesia, without advanced waste management systems and with higher levels of population and consumption growth, face particular challenges in addressing plastic waste and marine pollution. To address and prevent plastic marine pollution, Indonesia introduced mitigation initiatives, such as Extended Producer Responsibility, waste banks, and take back schemes. While recent research shows such approaches are able to prevent marine litter, research into their social and equity effects is scarce. This is problematic, because mitigation initiatives can have in- and exclusion effects in terms of access to valuable waste for vulnerable, informal waste actors. This article combines the sociology of network and flows with a network power typology to study how the implementation of waste banks in Klaten Municipality, Indonesia not only led to reduction in plastic pollution, but also the exclusion of cartmen, waste pickers and mobile intermediates from waste networks and thus from accessing these valuable waste flows. A waste bank is a community based business that provides households with additional income and turns household waste into economically valuable materials by trading them with recyclers. In doing so they outcompete a vulnerable group like waste pickers. Instead of waste pickers, households become part of the plastic waste networks. In addition to assessing environmental effects of (marine) plastic pollution mitigation initiatives, more scholarly attention should go towards assessing the in- and exclusion dynamics around different plastic mitigation initiatives. The sociology of network and flows is a useful lens through which to examine these in- an exclusion effects. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study examined the distinct effects of algae polysaccharides (AP), namely sodium alginate (SA), fucoidan (FU), and laminarin (LA), on the aggregation of nanoplastics (NP) in seawater, as well as their subsequent transport in seawater-saturated sea sand. The pristine 50 nm NP tended to form large aggregates, with an average size of approximately 934.5 ± 11 nm. Recovery of NP from the effluent (Meff) was low, at only 18.2 %, and a ripening effect was observed in the breakthrough curve (BTC). Upon the addition of SA, which contains carboxyl groups, the zeta (ζ)-potential of the NP increased by 2.8 mV. This modest enhancement of electrostatic interaction with NP colloids led to a reduction in the aggregation size of NP to 598.0 ± 27 nm and effectively mitigated the ripening effect observed in the BTC. Furthermore, SA's adherence to the sand surface and the resulting increase in electrostatic repulsion, caused a rise in Meff to 27.5 %. In contrast, the introduction of FU, which contains sulfate ester groups, resulted in a surge in ζ-potential of the NP to -27.7 ± 0.76 mV. The intensified electrostatic repulsion between NP and between NP and sand greatly increased Meff to 45.6 %. Unlike the effects of SA and FU, the addition of LA, a neutral compound, caused a near disappearance of ζ-potential of NP (-3.25 ± 0.68 mV). This change enhanced the steric hindrance effect, resulting in complete stabilization of particles and a blocking effect in the BTC of NP. Quantum chemical simulations supported the significant changes in the electrostatic potential of NP colloids induced by SA, FU and LA. In summary, the presence of AP can induce variability in the mobility of NP in seawater-saturated porous media, depending on the nature of the weak, strong, or non-electrostatic interactions between colloids, which are influenced by the structure and functionalization of the polysaccharides themselves. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex and variable behavior of NP transport in the marine environment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Rain gardens, a type of green infrastructure (GI), have been recognized for mitigating flooding and improving water quality from minor storms by trapping stormwater pollutants. Yet, the capability of these systems to retain microplastics (MPs) from stormwater, especially in size <125 μm, remains inadequately understood. This study investigated the spatial and temporal distributions of MPs in three rain gardens located in Newark, New Jersey, USA. The rain gardens have been in operation for ∼7 years and located in different land uses: low-density residential (Site 1), commercial (Site 2), and high-density residential (Site 3). The sediment samples were collected during May 2022, August 2022, and February 2023 at various soil depths and horizontal distances of rain gardens. The MPs were quantified and characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and a Raman microscope. The overall mean concentration varied between sampling sites, with 469 ± 89.8 pkg−1 in Site 1, 604 ± 91.4 pkg−1 in Site 2, and 997 ± 64.3 pkg−1 in Site 3, with Polypropylene as the dominant polymer, followed by nylon and polyethylene. In the vertical direction, larger MPs (250 μm–5 mm) were effectively retained within the top 5 cm and their concentration declined exponentially with the increasing depths. Small-sized MPs (1–250 μm) were prevalent at deeper depths (≥ 10 cm), and no MPs were found below 15 cm. In the horizontal direction, the highest MP concentration was observed near the stormwater inlet, and the concentration decreased away from the inlet. Over the nine-month period, a notable increase in concentration was observed at all sites. These findings contribute valuable knowledge towards developing effective measures for retaining MPs from stormwater and monitoring GIs in urban environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution is a pressing issue for both environmental health and the safety of human food sources. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of MPs on Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Lamarck 1819), focusing on the food safety risks associated with MP and cadmium (Cd) exposure in these organisms intended for consumption. The retention of different polymer types of MPs in mussels was specifically evaluated, and the influence of Cd on MP retention across these polymers was investigated. Mussels were exposed to polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs individually and in combination with the toxic metal Cd for a duration of 7 days. Antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress parameters, and digestive system enzyme activities, selected as biomarkers for Cd and MPs pollution, were assessed. Furthermore, human consumption risk evaluations and limits regarding mussel intake were analysed in terms of food safety. The results suggest that exposure to Cd, MPs, or their combination induces oxidative stress, tissue damage, and neurotoxicity. Alterations in digestive enzyme activities could impact the mussels' energy acquisition from food and their capacity to conserve energy reserves. The estimated daily intake (EDI), provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and target cancer risk (TCR) levels for all groups surpassed established limits, implying a significant health risk for humans consuming these products. These results underscore the potential health risks for humans associated with consuming mussels exposed to Cd and/or MPs and provide valuable data for monitoring pollution levels and ecological risks in aquatic organisms. Additionally, our findings reveal that the retention of Cd in mussel tissues varies significantly after exposure, with combinations of PET and Cd showing lower levels of Cd accumulation compared to other groups, suggesting a differential interaction that influences Cd retention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Mangrove ecosystem faces significant threats from the various pollutants including microplastic (MPs). The aim of this study was to assess variations in MP distribution in mangrove sediments of rhizosphere (R) and non-rhizosphere (NR) regions. A total of 14,960 MP particles were identified from Sandspit backwater (SS-1 & SS-2) and Creek areas (PQ & KC). Notably, the NR showed higher MP counts (7848) compared to the R region (7112). Analysis revealed variations in MP types, with beads being predominant in both R and NR, followed by film, fiber, and fragments. KC exhibited highest MP contamination, followed by PQ, SS-2, and SS-1. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene in sediments samples. This first detailed report on MP in mangrove sediments and other limited studies from Pakistan establishes the widespread distribution of MPs in the coastal area and provide a baseline for further elaboration in future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Colloidal interactions between clay minerals and microplastics (MPs) in high salinity seawater are crucial for determining MP fate in marine environments. Montmorillonite (MMT) forms thin and pliable films that tightly cover MPs, while the thick and rigid lamellae of kaolinite (KLT) have limited contact with MPs, resulting in unstable bonding. However, a small quantity of small-sized KLT can create relatively stable heteroaggregates by embedding into the interstitial spaces of MPs. Both MMT and KLT colloids can decrease the mobility of MPs in seawater-saturated sea sand, but their breakthrough curves (BTCs) show distinct phenomena of “blocking” and \"ripening\", respectively. The “blocking” phenomenon occurs when flexible MMT adheres to the sand surface, depleting attachment sites quickly and inhibiting the retention of subsequent heteroaggregates of MMT-wrapped MPs. The transport of single MMT also experiences colloid competition for attachment sites, but pre-equilibration experiments reveal no competition between MMT and bare MPs for attachment sites. Instead, the attached MMT provides additional attachment sites for MPs. These results suggest that the wrapping of MPs by MMT plays a dominant role in the “blocking” of cotransport. In contrast, rigid KLT forms a three-dimensional stack on the sand surface, offering more attachment sites for subsequent MPs and heteroaggregates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) as a plasticizer has been widely used in the processing of plastic products. Nevertheless, these DBP additives have the potential to be released into the environment throughout the entire life cycle of plastic products. Herein, the leaching behavior of DBP from PVC microplastics (MPs) in freshwater and seawater and its potential risks were investigated. The results show that the plasticizer content, UV irradiation, and hydrochemical conditions have a great influence on the leaching of DBP from the MPs. The release of DBP into the environment increases proportionally with higher concentrations of additive DBP in MPs, particularly when it exceeds 15 %. The surface of MPs undergoes accelerated oxidation and increased hydrophilicity under UV radiation, thereby facilitating the leaching of DBP. Through 30 continuous leaching experiments, the leaching of DBP from MPs in freshwater and seawater can reach up to 12.28 and 5.42 mg g-1, respectively, indicating that MPs are a continuous source of DBP pollution in the aquatic environment. Moreover, phthalate pollution index (PPI) indicates that MPs can significantly increase DBP pollution in marine environment through land and sea transport processes. Therefore, we advocate that the management of MPs waste containing DBP be prioritized in coastal sustainable development. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics are difficult to degrade and widespread environmental pollutants. Coastal areas are hardest hit of microplastic pollution as they receive significant amounts of microplastics discharged from inland sources. Golden pompano (Trachinotus blochii) is a high commercial valuable marine aquaculture fish species, most of the golden pompano are raised in coastal areas, which means they are at significant risk of exposure to microplastics. Therefore, we exposed golden pompano to 10 μg/L, 100 μg/L and 1000 μg/L of 5 μm spherical polystyrene microplastics and conducted a 14-day stress experiment. Histopathology results showed the intestinal villi shrank. The 16s sequencing analysis revealed that microplastics significantly impacted the abundance and community structure of intestinal microorganisms, which may affect the metabolic function of the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolomics sequencing of the intestinal contents showed that microplastics caused disruptions in lipid, glucose, and amino acid metabolism, thus compromising the normal digestion and absorption functions in the intestinal system. In addition, the activation of various pathways, including the intestinal endocrine system, proline metabolism, and signal transduction, which can lead to the occurrence of several diseases. This study combined various methods to investigate the adverse effects of microplastics on intestinal digestion and absorption, and provided new insights into the toxic mechanisms of microplastics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " There is limited research on the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in canned seafood. All types of canned seafood investigated in the present study were contaminated. After sample digestion in 30 % hydrogen peroxide, a total of 40 MPs were recovered. Fibers were the most common type, blue was the dominant colour, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) identified polyester as the most common polymer. Considering all samples, an average of 3.5 ± 5.2 MPs/can was obtained, with octopus in tomato sauce and tuna in olive oil presenting the highest contamination (5.2 ± 7.5 MPs/can and 5.2 ± 5.1 MPs/can, respectively). Also, significant differences between the number of MPs in the seafood tissues and immersion liquids were verified. The present study demonstrates MPs occurrence in canned seafood, a potential contamination pathway for humans. More research on the different stages of the canning processing is vital for understanding MPs contamination in cans. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Plastics provide numerous societal benefits but have adverse effects on the environment over their life cycles; however, the magnitude, time horizon, and scope of these impacts is uncertain, particularly for plastics that are lost to the environment. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method intended to capture environmental impacts of a product from cradle-to-grave, and has often been applied to plastics. This article undertakes a systematic literature review of LCA and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods tailored to plastics, with particular focus on end-of-life stages and impacts from plastics lost to the environment. The review identified 1541 articles for screening, of which 51 were selected for review. Results show that even when LCA studies are largely focused on end-of-life, most ignore the risks of losing plastics to the environment, and omit the attendant impacts. Articles devoted to creating LCIA methods for plastics in the environment are growing in number, and focus primarily, on the effects of macroplastics in the marine environment. The review shows an urgent need to better understand the probability of plastic losses to the environment and their fate and transport, and develop impact characterization factors that better reflect the effects of plastics on humans and ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Biodegradable plastics (BPs) have been widely advocated as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-derived polymers, aiming to mitigate the burgeoning crisis of microplastic pollution. However, incomplete biodegradation of BPs can generate more and smaller particles, such as microplastics, which may persist in environments. Knowledge of the fate and effects of BPs, especially biodegradable microplastics, in the aquatic environment remains limited. We investigate the concentrations, detection methods, and adverse effects of biodegradable microplastics on aquatic organisms in various aquatic environments. Biodegradable microplastics, such as poly(lactic acid), polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), and poly(butylene succinate), are found in wastewater, reservoirs, and marine environments at concentrations between 0.054 and 180 μg/L. Their environmental levels are negatively correlated with their degradation capacity in water. Biodegradable microplastics adversely affect aquatic microbial communities, plant adaptability, and animal physiology, with their toxicity increasing upon degradation. This review advocates for a critical reassessment of the use, disposal, and management strategies surrounding BPs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Micro- and nanoplastics have been detected in environmental compartments from the highest mountains to the deepest seas. They have been shown to be present at almost all trophic levels, and within humans they have been detected in numerous organs and human stool. Whilst their ubiquitous nature is indisputable, little is known about the health risks they may present. Much current research is focussed on the production of test materials with which to perform the necessary health studies. An important aspect of this is the correct storage and suspension of the materials to ensure they remain stable both chemically and with regards to size and shape. In this review, we look at the chemical stability of nine common polymers in a range of liquids; first with the use of commercial compatibility charts and then with a more quantitative approach using Hansen solubility parameters. We then look at stability with regards to particle agglomeration, whether and how stable compositions can be predicted, and which dispersants can be added to increase stability. Finally, we discuss the role of bio-surfactants and the eco-corona and how these may offer a route to both better stability and environmental relevance. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and their co-pollutants pose significant threats to soil and marine environments, necessitating understanding of their colonization processes to combat the plastic pandemic and protect ecosystems. MPs can act as invisible carriers, concentrating and transporting pollutants, leading to a more widespread and potentially toxic impact than the presence of either MPs or the pollutants alone. Analyzing the sorption and desorption dynamics of MPs is crucial for understanding pollutants amplification and predicting the fate and transport of pollutants in soil and marine environments. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the sorption and desorption dynamics of MPs, highlighting the importance of considering these dynamics in ecotoxicological risk assessment of MPs pollution. The review identifies limitations of current frameworks that neglect these interactions and proposes incorporating sorption and desorption data into robust frameworks to improve the ability to predict ecological risks posed by MPs and co-pollutants in soil and marine environments. However, failure to address the interplay between sorption and desorption can result in underestimation of the true impact of MPs and co-pollutants, affecting livelihoods and agro-employments, and exacerbate poverty and community disputes (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 16). It can also affect food production and security (SDG 2), life below water and life on land (DSGs 14 and 15), cultural practices, and natural heritage (SDG 11.4). Hence, it is necessary to develop new approaches to ecotoxicological risk assessment that consider sorption and desorption processes in the interactions between the components in the framework to address the identified limitations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In low-visibility environments, the underwater perception range of optical cameras is severely restricted, and perception operations in ocean engineering often rely on sonar. Acoustic cameras are a type of forward-looking sonar that have attracted considerable attention because of their ability to produce images similar to those of optical cameras. However, owing to the unique imaging mechanism employed by acoustic cameras, the resulting images suffer from insufficient resolution and a loss of feature details. This issue considerably diminishes the precision of downstream visual tasks, limiting the application of acoustic cameras. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based super-resolution reconstruction approach for acoustic cameras, where the reconstruction process relies only on images, without prior assumptions regarding the detection scenes. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method for two practical applications: marine debris detection and marine structure inspection. The experimental results show that our proposed method can robustly reconstruct high-resolution sonar images, and the obtained images have superior feature details, which improved the precision of downstream vision tasks. In this study, we aim to provide better solutions for underwater perception in low-visibility marine environments, while exploring the application of acoustic cameras in marine debris detection and structure inspection. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics, as a type of anthropogenic pollution in aquatic ecosystems, affect the carbon cycle of organic matter. Although some studies have investigated the effects of microplastics on dissolved organic matter (DOM), the impact of alterations in the chemical properties of microplastics on refractory DOM and carbon release remains unclear. Here, we observed that microplastic treatments (e.g., polystyrene, PS) altered the composition and function of microbial community, notably increasing the abundance of microbial families involved in consuming easily degradable organic matter. During the process in which microbial community decomposed organic matter into DOM, PS underwent surface oxidation. The oxidized PS aggregated with DOM and microorganisms through electrostatic interactions and chemical bonds. Moreover, these interactions between oxidized PS and microbial community affect the utilization of organic matter, resulting in a significant decrease in CO2 emissions. Specifically, total CO2 emissions decreased by approximately 23.76 % with 0.1 mg/L PS treatment and by 44.97 % with 10 mg/L PS treatment compared to those in PS-free treatments over the entire reaction. These findings underscored the significance of the chemical properties of PS in the interactions among DOM and microorganisms, emphasizing the potential impact of PS microplastics on the carbon cycle in ecosystems. © 2024,\n",
       " Increasing microplastic (MP) pollution poses significant threats to estuarine and coastal ecosystems. However, the effects of MPs on the emission of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, within these ecosystems and the underlying regulatory mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, a combination of 13C stable isotope-based method and molecular techniques was applied to investigate how conventional petroleum-based MPs [polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)] and biodegradable MPs [polylactic acid (PLA) and polyadipate/butylene terephthalate (PBAT)] regulate CH4 production and consumption and thus affect CH4 emission dynamics in estuarine and coastal wetlands. Results indicated that both conventional and biodegradable MPs enhanced the emission of CH4 (P < 0.05), with the promoting effect being more significant for biodegradable MPs. However, the mechanisms by which conventional and biodegradable MPs promote CH4 emissions were different. Specifically, conventional MPs stimulated the emission of CH4 by inhibiting the processes of CH4 consumption, but had no significant effect on CH4 production rate. Nevertheless, biodegradable MPs promoted CH4 emissions via accelerating the activities the methanogens while inhibiting the oxidation of CH4, thus resulting in a higher degree of promoting effect on CH4 emissions than conventional MPs. Consistently, quantitative PCR further revealed a significant increase in the abundance of methyl-coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA) of methanogens under the exposure of biodegradable MPs (P < 0.05), but not conventional MPs. Furthermore, the relative abundance of most genes involved in CH4 oxidation exhibited varying degrees of reduction after exposure to all types of MPs, based on metagenomics data. This study reveals the effects of MPs on CH4 emissions in estuarine and coastal ecosystems and their underlying mechanisms, highlighting that the emerging biodegradable MPs exhibited a greater impact than conventional MPs on promoting CH4 emissions in these globally important ecosystems, thereby accelerating global climate change. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The growing worry for human health stems from the fact that micropollutants (MPs), particularly dyes, are more common in aquatic settings. These particles pose a serious risk to both humans and animals since they have been found in a variety of bodily fluids and waste products from both humans and animals. MPs pose significant dangers to human health and other living things due to their extended half-lives, high fragmentation propensity, and capacity to absorb organic pollutants as well (MB, MR, MO and CV dyes) and heavy metals as well (Pb(II), Cd(II) Co(II) Cr(III) and Ag(I) ….). They also contribute to the degradation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Sustainable and effective methods for removing MPs from wastewater and treating organic micropollutants in an environmentally friendly manner are being developed in order to address this problem. This work offers a thorough review of adsorption technology as a productive and environmentally friendly means of eliminating MPs from aqueous environments, with an emphasis on developments in the application of polymeric resin in MP removal. The review examines the adsorption process and the variables that affect adsorption efficiency, including the characteristics of the micropollutant, the resin, and the solution. To improve understanding, a number of adsorption mechanisms and models are explored. The study also addresses the difficulties and future possibilities of adsorption technology, emphasising the need to optimize resin characteristics, create sustainable and affordable regeneration techniques, and take into account the environmental effects of adsorbent materials. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Increased mismanaged plastic has led to widespread microplastic (MPs) contamination in the marine environment. Our study investigates MPs across the inner, outer, and mangrove regions of the Kollidam River estuary on the east coast of India. Surface water and sediment samples at 18 locations were analysed for size, shape, colour, and polymer type. The average MP abundance in surface water and sediment was 2.42 particles. m−3and 1580 ± 705 particles. kg−1d.w. respectively. The predominant polymer types observed were PP (40%), PE (26%), and PAc (24%). Medium-sized particles (1–2.5 mm) are more in surface water (44%), and small-sized (0.01–1 mm) particles dominate in sediment samples (50%). The most common MP shapes were fibres and fragments, with transparent MPs being the most frequently observed colour. The results highlight that the mangrove region acts as a potential sink for microplastic pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important conservation tool for species and habitats; however, they are not a panacea solution. For example, MPAs provide little protection from plastic pollution which travels vast distances on ocean currents. Here we document exposure of juvenile Christmas Shearwaters (Puffinus nativitatis) to plastics on uninhabited Ducie Atoll in the remote South Pacific. Despite being surrounded by the very large Pitcairn Islands MPA, most birds (68.7 %; n = 16) contained 3.8 ± 4.1 pieces of ingested plastic. Unexpectedly, the number, mass and frequency of occurrence of plastic in two age classes (young downy chicks and fledglings) was similar. While the reason for this is unknown, it may suggest birds do not acquire new plastic items, or are able to rid themselves of plastics, beyond a certain age. We discuss the potential health consequences of plastic ingestion in Christmas Shearwaters and call for further research of this poorly studied species. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastics entering the marine environment primarily originate from land-based sources, prompting significant attention on single-use plastic packaging. However, fishing plastic waste also contributes substantially to marine plastic pollution, though it is often overlooked in the literature due to the challenges in pinpointing pollution sources. This study addresses this key knowledge gap by synthesizing existing literature to explore and document the knowns and known unknowns surrounding fishing plastic waste's environmental, health, and socio-economic impacts. Through the development of a causal loop diagram, the study offers a preliminary understanding of the issue, serving as a foundation for a deeper exploration of the complexities within the fishing industry's plastic waste dynamics. Finally, the study highlights that short-sighted views and approaches are likely to lead to systemic failures. Therefore, it advocates for strategic and meaningful measures to tackle marine plastic pollution, emphasizing the critical importance of a holistic and integrated understanding of the various plastic waste streams infiltrating and polluting our oceans. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems that can profoundly affect carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, the impact mechanisms of MPs on sedimentary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at distinct altitudes remain poorly elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polylactic acid (PLA) on sedimentary CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions at distinct altitudes of the Yellow River. PVC increased the relative abundance of denitrifiers (e.g., Xanthobacteriaceae, Rhodocyclaceae) to promote N2O emissions, whereas PLA reduced the abundance of AOA gene and denitrifiers (e.g., Pseudomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae), impeding N2O emissions. Both PVC and PLA stimulated the growth of microbes (Saprospiraceae, Aquabacterium, and Desulfuromonadia) associated with complex organics degradation, leading to increased CO2 emissions. Notably, the concurrent inhibition of PLA on mcrA and pmoA genes led to its minimal impact on CH4 emissions. High-altitude MQ sediments, characterized by abundant substrate and a higher abundance of functional genes (AOA, AOB, nirK, mcrA), demonstrated higher GHG emissions. Conversely, lower microbial diversity rendered the low-altitude LJ microbial community more susceptible to PVC, leading to a more significant promotion on GHG emissions. This study unequivocally confirms that MPs exacerbate GHG emissions via microbiome-mediated mechanisms, providing a robust theoretical foundation for microplastic control to mitigate global warming. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are prevalent throughout the oceans and pose a significant global environmental concern due to their detrimental effects on various living organisms. While researchers have investigated the toxicity mechanisms of MPs in marine species, there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding, particularly regarding the potential adverse effects on the growth and metabolism of bivalves. In this study, indoor exposure experiments were conducted on Pinctada fucata martensii to examine the impact of commercial polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-MPs (50 μm, 15 mg/L). The aim was to determine the effects of MPs on the hepatopancreas metabolism of P. f. martensii. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis indicated alterations in the hepatopancreatic metabolic of P. f. martensii following exposure to PVC-MPs. A total of 32, 27, and 154 differential metabolites (SDM) were identified in EG (1-d) vs CG (1-d), EG (15-d) vs CG (15-d), and EG (1-d) vs EG (15-d), respectively (VIP >1 and P < 0.05). Further examination of metabolic pathways revealed that PVC-MPs disrupted the metabolism of amino acids, particularly alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid metabolism; this suggests that the organism may have developed neurotoxicity. Sphingolipid metabolites showed a significant up-regulation in both EG (15-d) vs CG (15-d), as well as in EG (1-d) vs EG (15-d), indicating lipid peroxidation in the hepatopancreas of P. f. martensii following PVC-MPs exposure. Additionally, in EG (1-d) vs CG (1-d), starch and sucrose metabolism were significantly inhibited, glycolysis or gluconeogenesis pathways were promoted, and changes in energy metabolism were promoted. This study sheds light on the impact of MPs on the metabolism of bivalves, offering fresh insights into the detrimental effects of MPs on aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The cleanup of marine debris is an urgent problem in marine environmental protection. AUVs with visual recognition technology have gradually become a central research issue. However, existing recognition algorithms have slow inference speeds and high computational overhead. They are also affected by blurred images and interference information. To solve these problems, a real-time semantic segmentation network is proposed, called WaterBiSeg-Net. First, we propose the Multi-scale Information Enhancement Module to solve the impact of low-definition and blurred images. Then, to suppress the interference of background information, the Gated Aggregation Layer is proposed. In addition, we propose a method that can extract boundary information directly. Finally, extensive experiments on SUIM and TrashCan datasets show that WaterBiSeg-Net can better complete the task of marine debris segmentation and provide accurate segmentation results for AUVs in real-time.

       " This study investigated the distribution of microplastics and heavy metals, along with the interaction between the two in the sediments of urban rivers in China. Results showed that the abundance of microplastics ranged from 2412 ± 187.5 to 7638 ± 1312 items kg−1 dry sediment across different survey stations, with an average abundance at (4388 ± 713) items kg−1 dry sediment. Upon further categorization, it was found that transparent fragments were the primary color and type of microplastics present. The potential ecological risk index (RI) of heavy metals in sediments suggested a low level of ecological risk within a majority of the urban rivers studied. Cd was identified as the main potential ecological risk factor in the sediments of the studied areas. There was a relatively good significant linear relationship between the RI of heavy metals and the abundance of microplastics, bolstering the linkage between these two environmental pollutants. However, the concentrations of heavy metals in microplastics were not dependent on their corresponding contents in sediments. In fact, the concentration of Cu, Cd, and As in microplastics were higher than those in the sediments. This finding confirmed that microplastics could serve as carriers of heavy metals and introduce potential risks to aquatic wildlife and human through the food chain. © Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution represents a new threat to both marine environments and the species that reside within them. This study examined the temporal concentrations of microplastics found in the commercially and ecologically important bivalve, Cerasastoderma edule and the presence of microplastics in intertidal sediment from the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protected Area (SPA) of Dundalk Bay, Ireland. A microplastic range of 1.55 ± 1.38 to 1.92 ± 1.00 g−1 and 3.43 ± 2.47 to 6.90 ± 3.68 ind−1 was reported between seasons. Microfibres dominated the shape of microplastics present in both sediment and cockles. While a wider range of polymers were identified in cockles than in sediment, microplastic concentrations recovered from both intertidal sites studied were approximately double the estimated safe loading levels for this pollutant. The potential of cockles to perform as shallow environment biomonitors of microplastic pollution was identified as they presented buoyant microplastics that were not identified in sediment samples. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics/nanoplastics (MNPs) inevitably coexist with other pollutants in the natural environment, making it crucial to study the interactions between MNPs and other pollutants as well as their combined toxic effects. In this study, we investigated neurotoxicity in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) exposed to polystyrene micro/nanoplastics (PS-MNPs), triphenyltin (TPT), and PS-MNPs + TPT from physiological, behavioral, biochemical, and genetic perspectives. The results showed that marine medaka exposed to 200 ng/L TPT or 200 μg/L PS-NPs alone exhibited some degree of neurodevelopmental deficit, albeit with no significant behavioral abnormalities observed. However, in the PS-MP single exposure group, the average acceleration of short-term behavioral indices was significantly increased by 78.81%, indicating a highly stress-responsive locomotor pattern exhibited by marine medaka. After exposure to PS-MNPs + TPT, the swimming ability of marine medaka significantly decreased. In addition, PS-MNPs + TPT exposure disrupted normal neural excitability as well as activated detoxification processes in marine medaka larvae. Notably, changes in neural-related genes suggested that combined exposure to PS-MNPs and TPT significantly increased the neurotoxic effects observed with exposure to PS-MNPs or TPT alone. Furthermore, compared to the PS-MPs + TPT group, PS-NPs + TPT significantly inhibited swimming behavior and thus exacerbated the neurotoxicity. Interestingly, the neurotoxicity of PS-MPs was more pronounced than that of PS-NPs in the exposure group alone. However, the addition of TPT significantly enhanced the neurotoxicity of PS-NPs compared to PS-MPs + TPT. Overall, the study underscores the combined neurotoxic effects of MNPs and TPT, providing in-depth insights into the ecotoxicological implications of MNPs coexisting with pollutants and furnishing comprehensive data. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic pollution has emerged as a global environmental concern, impacting both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, understanding of plastic sources and transport mechanism at the catchment scale remains limited. This study introduces a multi-source plastic yield and transport model, which integrates catchment economic activities, climate data, and hydrological processes. Model parameters were calibrated using a combination of field observations, existing literature, and statistical random sampling techniques. The model demonstrated robust performance in simulating both plastic yield and transport from 2010 to 2020 in the upper and middle Mulan River Catchment, located in southeast China. The annual average yield coefficients were found to closely align with existing estimations, and the riverine outflow exhibited a high correlation coefficient of 0.97, with biases ranging from -63.0 % to -21.4 % across all monitoring stations. The analysis reveals that, on average, 12.5 ± 2.5 % of the total plastic yield is transported to rivers annually, with solid waste identified as the primary source, accounting for 37.8 ± 20.7 % of the total load to rivers, followed by agricultural film (26.4 ± 9.8 %), impermeable surfaces (21.5 ± 10.3 %), urban and rural sewage (10.4 ± 5.0 % and 3.0 ± 1.5 %, respectively), and industrial wastewater (0.9 ± 0.7 %). The annual average outflow was estimated to between 9.3 and 43.0 ton/year (median: 23.1) at a 95 % confidence level. This study not only provides insights into the primary sources and transport pathways of plastic pollution at the catchment scale, but also offers a valuable tool for informing effective plastic pollution mitigation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The issue of atmospheric microplastic (AMP) contamination is gaining increasing attention, yet the influencing factors and human exposure are not well-understood. In this study, atmospheric depositions were collected in the megacity of Chengdu, China, to investigate the pollution status and spatial disparities in AMP distribution. The relationship between AMP abundance and underlying surface types was then analyzed with the aid of back trajectory simulation. Additionally, a probabilistic estimation of human exposure to AMP deposition during outdoor picnics was provided, followed by the calculation of AMP loading into rivers. Results revealed that the mean deposition flux ranged within 207.1–364.0 N/m2/d (14.17–33.75 μg/m2/d), with significantly larger AMP abundance and sizes in urban compared to rural areas. Areas of compact buildings played an important role in contributing to both fibrous and non-fibrous AMP contamination from urban to rural areas, providing new insight into potential sources of pollution. This suggests that appropriate plastic waste disposal in compact building areas should be prioritized for controlling AMP pollution. Besides, the median ingestion of deposited AMPs during a single picnic was 34.9 N/capita/hour (3.03 × 10−3 μg/capita/hour) for urban areas and 17.8 N/capita/hour (7.74 × 10−4 μg/capita/hour) for suburbs. Furthermore, the worst-case scenario of AMPs loading into rivers was investigated, which could reach 170.7 kg in summertime Chengdu. This work could contribute to a better understanding of the status of AMP pollution and its sources, as well as the potential human exposure risk. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) degradation due to light radiation, weathering, water erosion and biodegradation might change MPs physical and chemical characteristics and thereby change MPs behaviors in natural environments. This study conducted a comparison investigation on polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE) and polyamide (PA) degradation in three different environmental conditions, namely simulated UV light, natural light and natural water body. The results showed that degradation of MPs in natural environments is more complex than the case in a controlled experimental condition (such as simulated UV light). In the conditions of natural light and natural water body, MPs are more easily covered by sediments/microorganisms. Particularly in the natural water body, biofilm development is an important factor for MPs degradation and this is dependent on where MPs are located. PVC in the water surface adsorbed more prokaryotes and eukaryotes than those in the water bottom while PE and PA showed the opposite. The research outcomes also show that a complex interaction between MPs and heavy metals in different environments. In simulated UV light, heavy metals tended to leach from MPs while in the natural light and natural water body, heavy metal concentrations of MPs had a higher variability caused by continuous leaching-adsorption behaviors. Those outcomes were expected to contribute to an in-depth understanding of MP degradations and their environmental behaviors. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pose one of the major environmental threats to marine organisms and ecosystems on a global scale. The present study investigated MPs in surface water, beach sediments, and fish in two coastal areas of Bangladesh namely Cox's Bazar and Kuakata. The MPs were identified and characterized using three different techniques, including the binocular microscope, the ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), and SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron Microscopy- Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy). The number of MPs in seawater was 10.1 ± 3.10 and 8.52 ± 3.92 items/100 L and in beach sediment, 13.2 ± 3.68 and 9.48 ± 3.63 items/100 g in Cox's Bazar and Kuakata, respectively. In fish samples, the abundance of MPs was 7.82 ± 1.28 and 6.82 ± 1.87 items/individual species of Cox's Bazar and Kuakata, respectively, where the highest quantities of MP were found in Euthynnus affinisand Sillago sihama and the lowest in Terapon jarbua and Pampus chinensisin Cox's Bazar and Kuakata, respectively. The number of MPs in GITs (Gastrointestinal tracts) was 1.63 ± 0.991 and 1.25 ± 0.546 items/g GIT and in BW (Body Weight) were 0.042 ± 0.014 and 0.037 ± 0.014 items/g BW in Cox's Bazar and Kuakata, respectively. There revealed a positive correlation between MP abundance and GIT weight and body weight in fish species. MPs were predominantly fiber-shaped, white/transparent, and small size. The most common MP polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene. SEM images of MPs demonstrate surface roughness, cracks, mechanical weathering and oxidative weathering, demonstrating their ongoing environmental exposure. The EDS spectrum unearthed that the MPs contained several elements (C, N, O, Na, Al, Fe, and Si). Findings from this study might be useful in coastal plastic particle management and to mitigate the potential risks associated with them. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The objective of this study was to determine microplastic-antibiotic interaction by examining how heat-activated persulfate decomposed polyamide adsorbed antibiotics and explored the environmental consequences of treated water. Sulfate radicals roughened the microplastic surfaces, significantly enhancing the adsorption capacity of polyamide. The kinetic and isotherm studies provided confirmation that electrostatic interactions were the primary mechanisms, with a minor contribution from H-bonding, highlighting that antibiotic adsorption was prone to occur, especially on the aged surface. Thermodynamic data indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The results showed significant negative effects of treated water on seed germination, copepod survival, and cell lines at only a higher concentration, due to a decrease in pH and the potential presence of polymer degradates. Our findings revealed the significant impact of decomposed polyamide on the antibiotic adsorption and offered insight into the potential harm that microplastic-treated water might cause to aquatic and marine ecosystems. © 2024,\n",
       " Rivers represent one of the main conduits for the delivery of plastics to the sea, while also functioning as reservoirs for plastic retention. In tropical regions, rivers are exposed to both high levels of plastic pollution and invasion of water hyacinths. This aquatic plant forms dense patches at the river surface that drift due to winds and currents. Recent work suggests that water hyacinths play a crucial role in influencing plastic transport, by efficiently trapping the majority of surface plastic within their patches. However, a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between water hyacinths and plastics is still lacking. We hypothesize that the properties relevant to plastic transport change due to their trapping in water hyacinth patches. In particular, the length scale, defined as the characteristic size of the transported material, is a key property in understanding how materials move within rivers. Here, we show that water hyacinth patches trap on average 54%–77% of all observed surface plastics at the measurement site (Saigon river, Vietnam). Both temporally and spatially, we found that plastic and water hyacinth presence co-occur. The formation of plastic-plant aggregates carries significant implications for both clean-up and monitoring purposes, as these aggregates can be detected from space and need to be jointly removed. In addition, the length scale of trapped plastics (∼4.0 m) was found to be forty times larger than that of open water plastics (∼0.1 m). The implications of this increased length scale for plastic transport dynamics are yet to be fully understood, calling for further investigation into travel distances and trajectories. The effects of plastic trapping likely extend to other key properties of plastic-plant aggregates, such as effective buoyancy and mass. Given the prevalence of plant invasion and plastic pollution in rivers worldwide, this research offers valuable insights into the complex environmental challenges faced by numerous rivers. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " This study was conducted to characterize and investigate the distribution of macroplastics in the nine coastal municipalities of Partido district, Camarines Sur, Philippines. The study aimed to quantify and categorize the macroplastics along the coastal areas of the study site. The results reveal variations in the type, color, size, category, and amount of plastic waste among different municipalities. Notably, plastic fragments, cigarette butt, food packaging, and disposable utensils emerged as the predominant forms of macroplastics within the study area. The majority of the collected plastic particles fell within the size range of 0.5–1.00 cm, while transparent, white, and green were identified as the prevailing colors in the samples of plastic waste. Furthermore, both hard plastic and soft plastic fragments were frequently encountered, accounting for 35% and 31% of the total plastic, respectively. Sagňay, Tigaon, and Caramoan exhibited the highest densities of macroplastics, with values of 0.62±0.11, 0.60±0.05, and 0.59±0.06 pcs/m2, respectively. In contrast, Garchitorena displayed the lowest density at 0.26±0.04. The remaining municipalities exhibited densities ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 pcs/m2. The elevated macroplastics density observed can be attributed to factors such as their degree of urbanization, tourist activity, and population density. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the composition and characteristics of macroplastics found along the coastal municipalities of Partido district, emphasizing the urgent need for effective strategies and policies to mitigate the possible impact to the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are found in a wide range of ecosystems, from the Arctic to the deep ocean. However, there is no data on their presence in terrestrial mammals that inhabit the Selva Maya. The aim of this study is to detect the presence of MPs in the feces of the Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) from the region of Calakmul, located in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We analyzed 129 fecal samples collected during 2017 and 2018, obtaining 57 and 72 samples during the rainy and dry seasons respectively. Sixty-eight percent of the samples contained 743 MPs with a mean of 19.3 ± 28.1 MPs/kg of dry weight (DW) feces in both years. An inter-annual variation in the average abundance of microplastic was observed during the two-year period (2017–2018), with a 72 % increase in these plastic particles in feces. Fourteen polymers were identified, with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PES) being the most abundant during both years. Although the effects of MPs on the health of tapirs are not known, their presence is cause for concern. There is an urgent need for the implementation of appropriate plastic waste management programs in communities of the Selva Maya to diminish the consumption of MPs in species including humans where they pose a significant risk to health. Environmental implications: The use of plastics worldwide is increasing every day, so the presence of microplastics is and will continue to be a major environmental problem. It is known that contaminants can adhere to plastics, making them hazardous materials. Microplastics can contaminate remote areas such as Biosphere Reserves. Terrestrial species such as the tapir can ingest microplastics, putting their health at risk. Knowing the dispersion of microplastics is very important in order to manage them properly, taking into account their emission sources and type of polymer. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Quantifying microplastics (MPs) in marine environments is challenging due to the complexities of differentiation from other materials. This study aims to distinguish petro-sourced plastic microfilaments from organic ones in environmental samples using scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. Therefore, 38 particles resembling MPs (PRMPs) from sediments and organisms in Madagascar were analyzed. MPs identification thresholds were determined from SEM-EDX analysis of macroplastics and seaweed, the primary sources of microfilaments. SEM-EDX results of the 38 PRMPs were compared with identification/misidentification made by five MPs observation experts. Results indicated that a carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio >1 distinguished macroplastics and MPs from other sources (seaweed and organic microfilaments). SEM-EDX analysis identified 81.58% of PRMPs as MPs. The average error made by one observer was 36.32%. These findings highlight the need for a method to assess identification error in MPs quantification and recommend SEM-EDX analysis of microfilaments to gauge observer error. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Significant research has shown that microplastics are ubiquitous within the marine environment, organisms are interacting with microplastics regularly, and microplastics at high concentrations can have significant impacts on organismal physiology and health. However, the potential impacts of this pervasive pollutant on organismal physiology at environmentally relevant concentrations is less well studied. To this aim, we exposed eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica to daily doses (45 d total exposure) of polyester microfibers (mean ± 1 SE: length = 662 ± 2 μm; width 16 ± 1 μm, n = 300 fibers, 1.38 g cm−3 density) at environmentally relevant concentrations (0, 2, and 95 fibers L−1) as well as a high exposure concentration (950 fibers L−1) to represent potential future microplastic increases. We quantified physiological responses in five key parameters: somatic growth, survival rate, clearance rate, plastic accumulation in somatic tissues, and cellular energy allocation (CEA). No significant responses were observed in any of these important physiological parameters, suggesting that polyester microfibers at current environmental concentrations appear to pose minimal threat to the physiological well-being of C. virginica within these study conditions. Substantial variation was observed in the number of fibers that accumulated per oyster ranging from 0 to 58 fibers per individual. This relatively broad range of fiber accumulation demonstrates individualistic interactions between oysters and microplastics, highlighting the need for sufficient sample sizes when investigating microplastic accumulation within somatic tissues in order to capture individual variance. Our study also highlights the importance of characterizing microplastic behavior (i.e., suspension time in water) in exposure studies to better understand actual exposure patterns and experimental outcomes. Results from our study demonstrate the critical importance of considering environmental relevance, in terms of exposure concentration, polymer type and particle sinking behavior, when conducting exposure studies and interpreting potential impacts of microplastics on organismal physiology. Our work provides novel information regarding the physiological responses of C. virginica when exposed to environmentally relevant microplastic pollution levels. Such information is beneficial for improving the design of future exposure studies to build upon and vital for understanding the current risk microplastics may pose to marine species and developing management strategies to deal with this emerging pollutant. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The concerning of plastic pollution in different ecosystems has been worsened by the widespread presence. Phthalate esters (PAEs), plasticizers found in everyday products, can migrate into the environment, especially into the oceans. Researches on their effects on cetaceans are still rare. Metabolomics helps assess perturbations induced by exposure to PAEs, which act as persistent endocrine disruptors. Four PAEs (dimethyl phthalate - DMP, diethyl phthalate - DEP, dibutyl phthalate - DBP, and di(2-ethylhexyl phthalate – DEHP) were analyzed, along with cholesterol and fatty acid profiles of P. blainvillei's blubber samples collected in southern Brazil. The study reveals pervasive contamination by PAEs - especially DEHP, present in all samples - with positive correlations between DEP content and animal size and weight, as well as between the DEHP amount and the C17:1 fatty acid. These findings will be relevant to conservation efforts aimed at this threatened species and overall marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " A baseline survey for floating microplastics (MPs) in the vicinity of a marine protected area and semi-enclosed bay of northern Peru was carried out. An average concentration of 0.22 MPs/L was estimated, primarily dominated by blue polyethylene terephthalate fibers. The distribution of floating MPs suggests that they tend to accumulate within the semi-enclosed Sechura Bay regardless of the sampling season. This behavior may be explained by local surface currents in the bay, which flow inwards and exhibit vorticities that could entrap MPs. Future studies are suggested to investigate the trajectory and fate of floating MPs within semi-enclosed areas. On the other hand, the impact of floating MPs on the trophic chain of coastal marine protected areas requires further research. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are priority contaminants of marine environments. However, their combined toxic effects on aquatic organisms are still largely unclear. In this study, the toxicological effects of microplastics (MPs) and Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative PAH, on Asian sea bass Lates calcarifer was investigated. Juvenile Asian sea bass were exposed for 56 days to polyethylene MPs (0.1 and 1 mg/L) and BaP (20 and 80 μg/L) as single or combined environmental stressors. The effects of MPs and BaP exposure on fish were evaluated considering several biological indices such as growth and condition indices, the oxidative stress response in the liver, and the expression levels of genes related to the stress, immunomodulation, detoxification, and apoptosis. Exposure to MPs and BaP in single or combined experiments significantly (P < 0.05) decreased fish growth, and altered body protein content and food conversion ratio (FCR), but greater magnitudes of changes was observed in the combined experimental group of BaP80 + MP1. The activities of liver antioxidant enzymes: catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) decreased; meanwhile, malondialdehyde (MDA) activity was dramatically enhanced (P < 0.05). The combined groups with higher concentrations (BaP80+ MP1) caused more severe alterations in enzyme levels compared to the single exposure groups and lower concentrations. MDA was the most affected among the studied enzymes. The expression levels of functional genes involved in stress response (GPX, HSP70, HSP90), pro-inflammation (LYZ, IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α), and detoxification (CYP1A) displayed significant alterations as the result of exposure to MPs and BaP single and in combination. The transcription levels of functional genes were more affected in fish exposed to BaP at 80 ng/mL when combined with MPs at 1 mg/mL. Additionally, MPs and BaP heightened the expression of apoptotic-related genes (p53 and caspase-3) on day 7 of exposure in a dose-dependent synergetic manner (P < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that exposure to MPs and BaP alone results in significant alterations in fish growth and condition factors, and could activate the stress response, stimulate the anti-oxidative defense system, immune transcriptomic response, and apoptosis in Asian sea bass; however, MPs can enhance the adverse effects of BaP on biological markers. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Nanoplastics (NPs) are one of the most hazardous marine litters, having the potential to cause far-reaching impacts on the environment and humankind. The effect of NPs on fish health has been studied, but their impact on the subcellular organelles remains unexplored. The present investigation studied the possible implications of polystyrene-nanoplastics (PS-NPs) on the hematology, tissue organization, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish were exposed to ∼100 nm PS-NPs at environmentally relevant (0.1 mg/L), and sublethal (1, 10 mg/L) concentrations for 14 days through water exposure. The growth performance and hematological parameters such as erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and leucocytes decreased, while thrombocytes increased with PS-NPs dose-dependently. The gills, liver, kidney, and heart tissues displayed increasing degrees of pathology with increased concentrations of PS-NPs. The gills showed severe epithelial hyperplasia and lamellar fusion. The liver had an abstruse cellular framework, membrane breakage, and vacuolation. While glomerular and tubular atrophy was the most prominent pathology in the kidney tissue, the heart displayed extensive myofibrillar loss and disorderly arranged cardiac cells. The ER-stress-related genes such as bip, atf6, ire1, xbp1, pkr, and apoptotic genes such as casp3a, and bax were over-expressed, while, the anti-apoptotic bcl2 was under-expressed with increasing concentrations of PS-NPs. Immunohistochemistry and blotting results of GRP78, CHOP, EIF2S, and ATF6 in gills, liver, kidney, and heart tissues affirmed the translation to ER stress proteins. The results revealed the sub-lethal adverse effects and the activation of the ER-stress pathway in fish with sub-chronic exposure to PS-NPs. © 2023,\n",
       " This study assessed the effects of pollutants on Magallana gigas along a coastal zone with different levels of human activity: a highly impacted zone in the Bahía Blanca Estuary and a less impacted zone on the adjacent sandy beaches. Oysters collected in 2021 were analyzed for various factors, including metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides, microplastics, oxidative stress and histology. Oysters of both environments exhibited detectable concentrations of all these pollutants in their tissues. However, the estuarine oysters showed higher concentrations of Zn, Cu and As and total PAHs than the beach oysters. Banned organochlorine pesticides were detected only in beach oysters. Estuarine oysters displayed morphological changes in their digestive gland including a reduction in the mean epithelial thickness of the tubule and elevated lipid peroxidation levels, indicating cellular damage. This study underscores the widespread presence of pollutants in M. gigas, indicating the need for effective strategies to safeguard coastal ecosystem health. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The causes of the physiological effects of microplastic pollution, potentially harming reef-building corals, are unclear. Reasons might include increased energy demands for handling particles and immune reactions. This study is among the first assessing the effects of long-term microplastic exposure on coral physiology at realistic concentrations (200 polyethylene particles L−1). The coral species Acropora muricata, Pocillopora verrucosa, Porites lutea, and Heliopora coerulea were exposed to microplastics for 11 months, and energy reserves, metabolites, growth, and photosymbiont state were analyzed. Results showed an overall low impact on coral physiology, yet species-specific effects occurred. Specifically, H. coerulea exhibited reduced growth, P. lutea and A. muricata showed changes in photosynthetic efficiency, and A. muricata variations in taurine levels. These findings suggest that corals may possess compensatory mechanisms mitigating the effects of microplastics. However, realistic microplastic concentrations only occasionally affected corals. Yet, corals exposed to increasing pollution scenarios will likely experience more negative impacts. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " According to a bibliometric analysis, studies on microplastic pollution in Malaysia are still incomprehensive. This study found microplastic contamination in sediment (97 particles/kg) and water (10,963 particles/m3) samples from Malaysian mangroves. Sediment from Matang and water from Kuala Selangor recorded the highest microplastic concentrations at 140 ± 5.13 particles/kg and 13,350 ± 37.95 particles/m3, respectively. Fragmented, blue, rayon and particles of <0.1 mm microplastic were the most abundant in sediment and water. In an experiment of polypropylene microplastic uptakes, Anadara granosa was found to uptake more 0.1 mm fiber particles. The uptake is strongly correlated to the presence of microplastics in sediment and water. The estimated dietary intake (EDI) indicates that a consumer could ingest 507 microplastic particles/year by consuming contaminated A. granosa. Therefore, mitigating measures are crucial to safeguard aquatic systems and humans from microplastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics in urban stormwater is one of the main sources of microplastics in aquatic systems, however, has rarely been reviewed systematically. Microplastic abundance ranges for microplastics in stormwater and sediment was 0.02–15499 items/L and 106–109089 items/kg, respectively. The highest average (7740.45 ± 10901.54 items/L) was obtained for the mean microplastic concentrations found for the stormwater samples collected in Italy. Stormwater sediment samples analyzed in Sao Paulo, South Africa reported the highest abundance of 109089 items/kg. Although numerous microplastic morphologies were detected in stormwater and sediment, fibers/lines were the most common. Polyethylene microplastics most prevalently found in global stormwater systems. Black is the most abundant color found among stormwater microplastics. Majority of microplastics were ranged from 100 μm to 500 μm. This review present environmental fate and behavior of microplastics in urban stormwater runoff and suggested directions for future research regarding approaches to more robust abundance data through standardized microplastic extraction protocols. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic contamination has rapidly become a serious environmental issue, threatening marine ecosystems and human health. This review aims to not only understand the distribution, impacts, and transfer mechanisms of microplastic contamination but also to explore potential solutions for mitigating its widespread impact. This review encompasses the categorisation, origins, and worldwide prevalence of microplastics and methodically navigates the complicated structure of microplastics. Understanding the sources of minute plastic particles infiltrating water bodies worldwide is critical for successful removal. The presence and accumulation of microplastics has far reaching negative impacts on various marine creatures, eventually extending its implications to human health. Microplastics are known to affect the metabolic activities and the survival of microbial communities, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fauna present in marine environments. Moreover, these microplastics cause developmental abnormalities, endocrine disruption, and several metabolic disorders in humans. These microplastics accumulates in aquatic environments through trophic transfer mechanisms and biomagnification, thereby disrupting the delicate balance of these ecosystems. The review also addresses the tactics for minimising the widespread impact of microplastics by suggesting practical alternatives. These include increasing public awareness, fostering international cooperation, developing novel cleanup solutions, and encouraging the use of environment-friendly materials. In conclusion, this review examines the sources and prevalence of microplastic contamination in marine environment, its impacts on living organisms and ecosystems. It also proposes various sustainable strategies to mitigate the problem of microplastics pollution. Also, the current challenges associated with the mitigation of these pollutants have been discussed and addressing these challenges require immediate and collective action for restoring the balance in marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Bioplastics are increasingly used as a solution to tackle plastic pollution problems. However, their degradability in natural environments is currently under debate. To evaluate their degradation efficiencies, we conducted in-situ degradation experiments in an open-air and two marine environments in Hong Kong. Three groups of biodegradable plastic were tested, namely (1) additive-modified low-density polyethylene (LDPE), labelled as oxo-biodegradable or photodegradable plastics, (2) polylactic acid (PLA), and (3) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/starch blends. Most biodegradable plastics fail to completely degrade but remain visually present after six months of exposure. Only PLA is able to demonstrate 100 % disintegration in one to three months in marine settings, suggesting that subtropical marine environments may favor PLA degradation. Biodegradable plastics that are bio-based (PLA and PVA/Starch blends) show notably larger mass losses by 23–100 % than the fossil-based ones (modified-LDPE). Our results reveal higher degradation efficiencies of PLA and PVA/Cassava starch blend in marine than open-air settings (with mass losses larger by 50 %, and by 39–41 %, respectively), potentially via biodegradation and hydrolysis. Meanwhile, modified-LDPE and PVA/Corn starch blends in general show higher degradation efficiencies in open-air than marine settings (with mass losses larger by 2 %, and by 17–33 %, respectively), potentially via abiotic oxidation. Since all tested biodegradable plastics exhibit potential fragmentation signs, further investigation is needed to characterize the behaviours of the microplastics generated. The current labelling on biodegradable bags fails to provide comprehensive information regarding their actual environmental degradation behaviours, especially considering their fragmentation risk and limited degradation exhibited in this study. This highlights the imperative for improved messaging to ensure consumers are better informed about these products. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " High throughput classification of marine particles facilitates the fast environment monitoring of harmful microalgae blooms and microplastic pollution. A conceptual setup of flow Stokes microscopy is based on a Stokes microscope whose imaging area is passed through by the suspension flow in a microchannel to measure a time series of Stokes images. The setup's measurement speed is 4.25 ml per hour and the particulate concentration error is less than 6 %. Standard microplastics and cultured microalgae are measured and classified with a general accuracy larger than 99 %. Also, some of them are accurately classified when mixing with the natural seawater. Both the imaging and polarization features’ contributions are analyzed. Improvements in the microchannel are discussed to achieve higher throughput, more robust classification, and broader application. This work demonstrates the flow Stokes microscopy's power for high throughput classification of marine particles, which provides a promising tool in future aquatic environmental monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",

       " The difference in the transport behaviors of nanoplastics consistently assistant with their toxicities to benthic and other aquatic organisms is still unclear between freshwater and marine sediments. Here, the mobilities of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and key environmental factors including salinity and humic acid (HA) were systematically studied. In the sand column experiments, both tested PSNPs in the freshwater system (100 nm NPs (100NPs): 90.15 %; 500 nm NPs (500NPs): 54.22 %) presented much higher penetration ratio than in the marine system (100NPs: 8.09 %; 500NPs: 19.04 %). The addition of marine sediment with a smaller median grain diameter caused a much more apparent decline in NPs mobility (100NPs: from 8.09 % to 1.85 %; 500NPs: from 19.04 % to 3.51 %) than that containing freshwater sediment (100NPs: from 90.15 % to 83.56 %; 500NPs: from 54.22 % to 41.63 %). Interestingly, adding HA obviously led to decreased and slightly increased mobilities for NPs in freshwater systems, but dramatically improved performance for NPs in marine systems. Electrostatic and steric repulsions, corresponding to alteration of zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of NPs and sands, as well as minerals owing to adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and aggregations from varied salinity, are responsible for the mobility difference. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) contamination is one of the significant escalating environmental concerns worldwide, and this stems from the increasing production and unlawful disposal of plastic materials. Regretfully, the synthesis of plastic materials is expected to triple in the upcoming years. Nevertheless, MPs pollution in marine, aquatic, and terrestrial settings has received much attention, unlike in groundwater systems. This study exhaustively reviewed varying degrees of recent publications in various search engines and provided a detailed state of current knowledge and research progress vis-à-vis MPs and cock-tail pollution in groundwater systems. Evidently, groundwater sources are severely contaminated as a result of growing anthropogenic activities and vertical movement of MPs and cock-tails from the atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic environments, however, fewer researchers have fixated their attention on estimating the occurrence of MPs in groundwater resources, while sufficient information regarding their sources, sampling methods, abundance, transport pathways, fate, modeling techniques, appropriate and adequate data, sorption properties, separation from other environmental media, toxicity, and remedial measures are extensively lacking. In addition, MPs may combine with other toxic emerging contaminants to improve migration and toxicity; however, no research has been conducted to fully understand cock-tail migration mechanisms and impacts in groundwater systems. Over time, groundwater may be regarded as the primary sink for MPs, if effective actions are neglected. Overall, this study detected a lack of concern and innumerable voids in this field; hence, vital and nascent research gaps were identified for immediate, advanced, and interdisciplinary research investigations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) occurrence in marine ecosystems is well known, but their accumulation in seaweeds and subsequent human exposure remain understudied. This research quantifies MPs presence in two commonly consumed seaweeds, kelp (Saccharina japonica) and nori (Pyropia yezoensis), in East Asia, revealing widespread contamination dominated by microfibers (<500 μm). Based on dietary patterns, human uptake through seaweed consumption was estimated and quantified. Notably, Chinese people consume an estimated 17,034 MPs/person/year through seaweed consumption, representing 13.1% of their total annual MPs intake. This seaweeds-derived exposure surpasses all other dietary sources, contributing up to 45.5% of overall MPs intake. The highest intake was in South Korea, followed by North Korea, China, and Japan. This research identifies seaweeds as a major, previously overlooked route of dietary MPs exposure. These findings are crucial for comprehensive risk assessments of seaweed consumption and the development of mitigation strategies, particularly for populations in East Asian countries. © 2024,\n",
       " The dawn of mass plastic production in the early 20th century has accelerated the penetration of microplastics into the environment, making them known to be an insidious threat to diverse ecosystems. The current scenario for microplastics is dire, as they pervade living organisms and disrupt vital functions while also affecting the environment by altering soil quality. They pose an inherent risk to human health, making their elimination a multifaceted challenge. Due to factors such as small size, low biodegradability, and ubiquity, microplastics are particularly challenging to detect, and methods for their elimination from terrestrial and marine environments are an ever-evolving field of research. The detection of such microplastics has necessitated the use of various biotechnological techniques to monitor microplastic pollution. The control of microplastic pollution in natural ecosystems can be met by replacing mass-produced single-use plastics with viable bio-based alternatives. The main objectives of this review are to discuss how microplastic pollution is currently monitored, assessed, and controlled using satellite-generated imagery complemented with a range of biotechnological and bioremedial techniques. This review also traces the development of a range of bio-based plastic alternatives that are observed to potentially replace single-use plastics. Further discussion on the various challenges and prospects for the mitigation of microplastics will also be conducted, stressing the importance of future research. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are crucial in regulating microbial communities, thereby influencing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in freshwater ecosystems. MPs’ presence in lake sediment has been confirmed to be aged, necessitating a reassessment of their influence on GHG emissions. This study aims to investigate the impacts of MPs with various aging methods on organic carbon decomposition and GHG release in urban lake sediments. During the four-week duration of the microcosm experiment, the conventional polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable Poly (butylene-adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) MPs were subjected to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and biological aging methods to investigate their impacts on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from lake sediment. Compared to pristine PE, pristine PBAT significantly exacerbated the detrimental impact on CO2 and CH4 emissions by 21.61% and 43.13%, respectively, mainly due to 10% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 22.65% increase in microbial biomass carbon (MBC). The surface morphology and functional groups of MPs were changed obviously after aging, thereby influencing the decomposition potential of organic carbon and the capacity of microbial reproduction. The aging process of PBAT reduced the available nutrients for microbial activity due to its rapid degradation, leading to a pronounced inhibitory effect on microbial respiration. Besides, MPs aging altered the microbial relative abundance of phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, as well as families Lutispora and Azospirillaceae, thus exerting influence on capacity and anaerobic proportion of microbial respiration. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Interactions between positively charged amino-modified (APS) and negatively charged bare (BPS) polystyrene nanoplastics may cause heteroaggregation in aquatic environments. This study investigated the effects of particle concentration ratio, solution chemistry [electrolytes, pH, and natural organic matter (NOM)], and interaction sequence on their heteroaggregation kinetics. In the absence of electrolytes and NOM, the APS/BPS ratio for attaining maximum heteroaggregation rate (khetero) increased from APS/BPS= 3/7 to APS/BPS= 1/1 as pH increased from 4 to 10, indicating that electrostatic interactions dominated heteroaggregation. In the absence of NOM, khetero ranked APS/BPS= 2/3 > APS/BPS= 1/1 > APS/BPS= 3/2. Colloidal stability decreased linearly as pH increased from 4 to 8 at APS/BPS= 1/1, while diffusion-limited heteroaggregation persisted at pH 10. In NaCl solution, humic acid (HA) retarded heteroaggregation more effectively than sodium alginate (SA) via steric hindrance and weakening electrostatic interactions, following the modified Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (MDLVO) theory. Compared with simultaneous interactions among APS, BPS, NaCl, and NOM, the NOM retardation effects on heteroaggregation weakened if delaying its interaction with others. In CaCl2 solution, the effects of NOM on heteroaggregation depended on counterbalance among charge screening, steric hindrance, and calcium bridging. These findings highlight the important role of heteroaggregation between oppositely charged nanoplastics on their fate and transport in aquatic environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has been widely reported across water matrices including in estuaries, which are important for the understanding of oceanic MPs. Estuaries can greatly alter the fate, transport, size distribution, and abundance of plastic pollution. The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize MP pollution in the Delaware Bay estuary USA, including the size distribution. Samples (N = 31) were collected from the mouth of the Delaware River to the coastal ocean including multiple frontal zones across two sampling campaigns (2019 and 2022). MP were extracted from the collected particles using wet peroxide oxidation and density separation with saturated sodium chloride. Particles collected on 500 μm mesh sieves were analyzed via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Across all samples, 324 of the 1015 particles analyzed were MP, and 11 macroplastics were observed. MP concentrations ranged from below detection to 4.12 MP/m3 (mean 0.34 ± 0.80 MP/m3). No significant differences were observed between sampling sites; nonetheless, the two highest MP concentrations were observed when sampling along frontal zones with visible debris including macroplastics. Polyethylene (53%) and polypropylene (43%) were the most abundant polymers observed. The majority of the non-plastic particles were classified as particulate natural organic matter (82% of non-plastics). Particles from samples collected during 2022 (N = 864) also had color, morphology, and two size dimensions recorded. MP particle size was significantly associated with sampling site, with the coastal ocean sampling site generally having the smallest MPs. A correlation between total post-extraction particles and total plastic particles was observed. Aspect ratios for the plastics ranged from one to 40.7, with larger ratios for fibers, with a mean (±standard deviation) of 3.39 ± 4.72 (unitless). These aspect ratios can be used to select shape factors used to estimate the total volume of MP in the studied size range. Overall, these results can help inform fate, transport, and risk assessments related to estuarine plastic pollution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are the pollutants, found widely across various environmental media. However, studies on the MP pollution in urban rivers and the necessary risk assessments remain limited. In this study, the abundance and characteristics of microplastics in a typical urban river were examined to evaluate their distribution, sources, and ecological risks. It was observed that the abundance of MPs in sediments (220–2840 items·kg−1 dry weight (DW)) was much higher than that in surface water (2.9–10.3 items·L−1), indicating that the sediment is the “sink” of river MPs. Surface water and sediment were dominated by small particle size MPs (< 0.5 mm). Fiber and debris were common shapes of MPs in rivers and sediments. The microplastics in river water and sediments were primarily white and transparent, respectively. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the major polymers found. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics generated from fragmentation of leftover plastics and industrial waste has reached in the remotely located Asian water tower (AWT) region, the 3rd pole of earth and origin site of several freshwater rivers. The accumulation of microplastics in AWT ecosystem has potential to alter the climatic condition contributing in global warming and disturbing the biodiversity structural dynamics. The present paper provides a comprehensive critical discussion over quantitative assessment of microplastics in different ecosystems (i.e. river, lakes, sediment and snow or glacier) of AWT. The hydrodynamic fate and transport of microplastics and their ecological impact on hydromorphology and biodiversity of AWT has been exemplified. Furthermore, key challenges, perspectives and research directions are identified to mitigate microplastics associated problems. During survey, the coloured polyethylene and polyurethane fibers are the predominant microplastics found in most areas of AWT. These bio–accumulated MPs alter the rhizospheric community structure and deteriorate nitrogen fixation process in plants. Significance in climate change, MPs pollution is enhancing the emissions of greenhouse gases (NH3 by ∼34% and CH4 by ∼9%), contributing in global warming. Considering the seriousness of MPs pollution, this review study can enlighten the pathways to investigate the effect of MPs and to develop monitoring tools and sustainable remediation technologies with feasible regulatory strategies maintaining the natural significance of AWT region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " We explored the presence of microplastics in the Finnish Arctic Sámi home area. A dialogue between Indigenous knowledge and scientific field work produced data about microplastics in remote wilderness aquatic ecosystems. Methods included geographical Indigenous knowledge analysis, water sampling with fraction filtration, and imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The MPs found were small; the mean particle size was 126 ± 121 μm. Particle concentrations of MPs in freshwater and marine samples varied between 45 and 423 MPs m−3 and the most common polymer types were polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. In conclusion, because microplastics are present even in the wilderness areas, their abundance should be monitored to assess plastic pollution in the relatively pristine Arctic environments. Sámi Indigenous knowledge proved to be a beneficial and important initiator, because locals recognize the possible sources and transport pathways of plastic litter, and practical sampling sites in the complex freshwater systems of the area. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The protection of the marine environment in the East Asian region (EAS region) faces a significant challenge from marine plastic pollution (MPP), highlighting the need for effective regulations and management by regional institutions. Employing empirical research methods, we examine the existing variation of institutional architectures and their regulatory measures regarding MPP in this region. Our study reveals regional institutions and initiatives established to address marine environmental protection against this issue, resulting in a variety of complex and overlapping regulations and policies. While these efforts show positive impacts, gaps in implementing regulations and policies remain significant. Managing institutional interlinkages is crucial to enhancing the effectiveness and accountability of efforts against MPP. In this context, we propose the concept of interplay management as a strategy to improve these efforts in the EAS region. Furthermore, our research highlights the necessity of implementing the concept of polycentric governance in future global agreements on plastic pollution, including marine environments. This approach aims to foster better cooperation and coordination among regions and institutions involved in marine environmental protection against MPP. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " South-East Asia is among the least studied regions for the growing issue of marine debris pollution, despite being a major contributor towards global marine debris. In the present study, we provide the preliminary results from the MARsCI project, a survey protocol designed to utilise citizen science to facilitate data collection on the ecological impact of discarded fishing gear (DFG) in Thailand. Over a three-year period, 103 surveys were carried out across Thailand, resulting in impact assessment of 606 pieces of DFG. Our findings indicate corals are regularly impacted by DFG in Thai waters and that isolated marine habitats may be more severely impacted than near-shore sites. We further identify crabs, muricid snails, and demersal fish to be among the most regularly entangled animals. We discuss our findings in the context of earlier work from Thailand, and conduct a critical review of the protocol itself, identifying improvements for future efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study addresses the pressing issue of plastic pollution in coastal and marine ecosystems, challenging the misconception that the entrapment of plastics can be considered as an ecosystem service. We differentiate between essential natural processes that sustain ecological balance and biodiversity and the detrimental accumulation of synthetic polymers. The pathways through which plastics enter these environments—from terrestrial to maritime sources—are examined, alongside their pervasive impacts on crucial ecosystem services such as habitat quality, the vitality of marine species, and nutrient cycling. Our findings highlight the paradox of resilience and vulnerability in these ecosystems: while capable of accumulating substantial amounts of plastic debris, they suffer long-lasting ecological, socio-economic, and health repercussions. We argue for a paradigm shift in management strategies aimed at reducing plastic production at the source, improving waste management practices, conducting targeted cleanup operations, and rehabilitating impacted ecosystems. Emphasizing a comprehensive understanding of plastic pollution is vital for framing effective solutions and necessitates a reevaluation of societal, industrial, and regulatory frameworks. This shift is imperative not only to address current pollution levels but also to safeguard and sustain the functionality of coastal ecosystems, ensuring their ability to continue providing essential services and supporting biodiversity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In this study, we aimed to evaluate and characterise the microplastic pollution in the sediment and commercial fish species in the Gemlik Bay, the Marmara Sea. Our results showed that the highest concentration of microplastics in the sediment was at the station in the Gemport Harbour (9.73 pieces.kg-1) and the lowest concentration was at the Kurşunlu offshore (3.33 pieces.kg-1). The highest microplastic concentration per individual was in the gills of Synapturichthys kleinii (Risso, 1827) (14.5 pieces.ind-1) and the lowest in Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758) (0.33 pieces.ind-1). The highest concentration (8.75 pieces.ind-1) was indicated in the gastrointestinal tract of Chelidonichthys lucerna (Linnaeus, 1758), but the lowest concentration (0.88 pieces.ind-1) was in that of D. annularis species. The fiber-type particles were the most determined microplastics in both the sediment and fish samples. The Micro-Raman Spectrometer revealed that Polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene were dominant in the sediment, and polyoxymethylene and polyphenylene sulfone polymers were dominant in fish species. © 2024, Central Fisheries Research Institute.

       " Plastic products, despite their undeniable utility in modern life, pose significant environmental challenges, particularly when it comes to recycling. A crucial concern is the pervasive introduction of microplastics (MPs) into aquatic ecosystems, with deleterious effects on marine organisms. This review presents a detailed examination of the methodologies developed for MPs removal in water treatment systems. Initially, investigating the most common types of MPs in wastewater, subsequently presenting methodologies for their precise identification and quantification in aquatic environments. Instruments such as scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and Raman tweezers stand out as powerful tools for studying MPs. The discussion then transitions to the exploration of both existing and emergent techniques for MPs removal in wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. This includes a description of the core mechanisms that drive these techniques, with an emphasis on the latest research developments in MPs degradation. Present MPs removal methodologies, ranging from physical separation to chemical and biological adsorption and degradation, offer varied advantages and constraints. Addressing the MPs contamination problem in its entirety remains a significant challenge. In conclusion, the review offers a succinct overview of each technique and forwards recommendations for future research, highlighting the pressing nature of this environmental dilemma. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Over the past decades, the accumulation of plastics in mangrove ecosystems has emerged as a significant environmental concern, primarily due to anthropogenic activities. Polypropylene (PP) films, one of the plastic types with the highest detection rate, tend to undergo intricate aging processes in mangrove ecosystems, leading to the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that may further influence the local bacterial communities. Yet, the specific effects of new and weathered (aged) plastic films and the associated leached DOM on bacterial consortia in mangrove sediments remain poorly understood. In this study, an incubation experiment was conducted to elucidate the immediate effects and mechanisms of the new and relatively short-term (45 or 90 days) aged PP films, as well as their leached DOM (PDOM), on characteristics of DOM and the bacterial community structure in mangrove sediments under different tidal conditions. Surface morphology and functional group analyses showed that both new and aged PP films exhibited comparable degradation profiles under different tidal conditions over the incubation period. As compared to the new PP film treatments, the introduction of the short-term aged PP films significantly affected the content of humic-like compounds in sediments, and such effects were partially ascribed to the release of PDOM during the incubation. Although the addition of PP films and PDOM showed minor effects on the overall diversity and composition of bacterial communities in the sediments, the abundance of some dominant phyla exhibited a growth or reduction tendency, possibly changing their ecological functions. This study was an effective attempt to investigate the relationship among plastic surface characteristics, sedimentary physicochemical properties, and bacterial communities in mangrove sediments. It revealed the ecological ramifications of new and short-term plastic pollution and its leachates in mangrove seedtimes, enhancing our understating of their potential impacts on the health of mangrove ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Micro- (0.5–5 mm) and meso-size (0.5–2.5 cm) floating marine litter was collected in June 2022 in the southeastern part of the Baltic Sea using a manta trawl (mesh size 335 µm). Plastic items, excluding fibers and paint flakes, accounted for approximately 90.1% of the total number of collected particles in fifteen surface water samples. The contamination level ranged from (0.33–23.90)×105 items/km2 (or 0.22–15.93 items/m3, or 5–1779 g/km2, or 0.03–11.86 mg/m3). Foamed PS particles accounted for 49.2% of the total number of collected particles. The mass of paraffin in each sample was high, ranging from 1.4 to 3750 g/km2 (9.1×10–3–25.0 mg/m3), which was comparable to or greater than the mass of plastic. This study suggests that plastic particles are retained at the water surface by paraffin stains left after washing tanks on transport ships. This finding highlights an unexpected aspect of the contribution of shipping to plastic pollution in the region. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is becoming a global problem due to its ubiquitous occurrence and the impacts detected for many species. However, the research about plastics in nests of terrestrial bird species has remained relatively overlooked in comparison to those devoted to marine ecosystems. Here we study the occurrence and patterns of use of anthropogenic material in nests of two passerine birds, the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica) and the European serin (Serinus serinus), breeding in an orange tree cultivation in Mediterranean Spain. Our results show that both species use extensively plastic debris as nest material; almost 71% of the European serin nests and 96% of nests of Eurasian magpies contained plastic debris. Furthermore, by analyzing the plastic debris availability in the agricultural landscape surveyed we confirmed a selection pattern in the two species. Thus, both species preferably select plastic filaments over other plastic debris. The Eurasian magpie does not select plastic based on size or color but the European serin avoid black plastics prefer smaller fragments in comparison to the average size available. Moreover, we suggest the apparent similarity of plastic filaments with the natural materials typically used by these species, as well as how they use the plastic in their nests could influence their selection behavior. More studies focused on terrestrial birds inhabiting human modified habitats could offer a deeper approach to how plastic debris interacts with wildlife in different ways. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In situ measurements are key to depict the hydrodynamic patterns of estuarine regions. Whereas extended studies are available on major estuaries, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning smaller ones. In this study, the analyses of dedicated in situ campaigns are presented to unravel the hydrodynamic patterns of a small shallow-water estuary located in northern Portugal – the Ave Estuary – in view of a possible implementation of new ecosystem-based management measures to contain plastic pollution. The in situ campaigns performed, which monitored several parameters, such as water depth, salinity, temperature, turbidity and current velocity and bottom sediment grain-size, revealed a highly stratified estuary, with very strong vertical salinity gradients. The measured current velocities were low but, despite its low velocities and low river flows, this estuary revealed interesting hydrodynamic patterns associated with local and remote (oceanic) conditions. The currents were mostly generated by tides and estuarine circulation during low river flows and by river dominance during high river flows. However, the study demonstrated that the circulation is also influenced by the coastal conditions generated by the plume of a neighbouring estuary, which enhanced an oceanward transport in the estuarine surface layer and an upstream flow in the bottom layer, revealing the importance of considering coastal conditions to understand the circulation patterns of shallow-water small estuaries. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The investigation along the Coromandel coastline of South-east India focused on assessing microplastics abundance using Simpson's diversity index (DIMP), Degradation-carbonyl index (DgCIMP), Pollution load index (PLIMP) and Ecological risk fraction (RfMP). These indices evaluated the dissemination and transportation of MPs across a 1076 km stretch divided into five zones from Chennai to Kanyakumari. During the wet season, average microplastics abundance (101 ± 36.6 items/kg dw) was lower compared to the dry season (143 ± 56.2 items/kg dw). Notably, 54% and 45% of microplastics were found in the 0.1–0.5 mm size range, with 45% and 64% being colored microplastics, and 80% and 71% being fibers during the wet and dry seasons respectively. Micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μFTIR) analysis showed rayon (34%) and PE (64%) dominance in ports and estuaries during both seasons. Kottaipattinam Port exhibited higher diversity indices (DIMPsh=0.56,DIMPsz=0.66,DIMPco=0.50andDIMPpo=0.65) compared to other zones, with an overall diversity index IDIMP of 0.57. Notably, among the DgCIMP values (n = 96), only 12 fell within the moderate photo-chemical oxidation range (0.16–0.35), while the majority (n = 60) surpassed 0.35 indicating higher oxidation levels, with some (n = 24) exceeding 0.50, signifying extreme oxidation. PLIMP revealed that 42% of sampling stations had very low to negligible MP contamination levels in ports and estuaries. However, ecological risk fraction RfMP values ranged from 10.2 to 13,670, with 27% of values exceeding 1500, indicating higher coastal ecological risk in 13 sampling stations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have been found in remote high-altitude areas, but the main source and migration process remained unclear. This work explored the characteristics and potential sources of MPs in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin. The average abundances of MPs in water, sediment, and soil samples were 728.26 ± 100.53 items/m3, 43.16 ± 5.82 items/kg, and 61.92 ± 4.29 items/kg, respectively, with polypropylene and polyethylene as the main polymers. The conditional fragmentation model revealed that the major source of MPs lower than 4000 m was human activities, while that of higher than 4500 m was atmospheric deposition. Community analysis was further conducted to explore the migration process and key points of MPs among different compartments in the basin. It was found that Lhasa (3600 m) and Shigatse (4100 m) were vital sources of MPs inputs in the midstream and downstream, respectively. This work would provide new insights into the fate of MPs in high-altitude areas. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Rivers play pivotal role in transporting plastic litter into the ocean. The present study aimed to estimate microplastics (MPs) in Palar River (PR), that receives waste inputs of agricultural, industries, fishing, and domestic origin. Water and sediment samples were collected during low tide, at seven locations from inner check dam to mouth region. Highest concentration of MPs in water are observed at PR-6 (28.01 × 104 particles.km−2) and the lowest was recorded at PR-4 (2.6 × 104 particles.km−2). In sediment, highest count was detected at PR-1 (8.8 × 102 ± 226 particles.kg−1 d.w) and the lowest was recorded in PR-6 (2.5 × 102 ± 14 particles.kg−1d.w). MPs distribution in water is more in the outer mouth (PR-6) in comparison to inner region (PR-4). Fibres were dominating morphotype of MPs, comprised of 79.4% in water and 89.8% in sediment samples. According to size classification, the majority of particles (41.02% in water and 56.1% in sediment) were in the size range of 1 μm to 1000 μm. Characterization of MPs through Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is the dominant polymer indicating the use of plastic fishing nets and ropes along with the outfall from nearby industries may be the main contributor to the microplastic pollution in the river. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " The guanay cormorant (Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum) and red-legged cormorant (Poikilocarbo gaimardi) are known for their prolific nest-building behavior, utilizing a diverse array of materials, including anthropogenic debris, thereby serving as valuable indicators of ocean plastic pollution. To elucidate inter-specific variations in nest plastic occurrence between these two cormorant species, we conducted a comprehensive examination of nests at 12 colonies along the Peruvian coast in 2018–2019. Our findings revealed a significantly higher occurrence of plastic in red-legged cormorant nests (mean 50 ± 27 %, N = 100 nests in 7 colonies) compared to guanay cormorant nests (mean 10 ± 20 %, 3497 nests in 8 colonies). Furthermore, the prevalence of plastic waste varied across colonies within both species. Off-white/clear plastic bags were the predominant color and type of debris found in both cormorant nests. This study is a baseline of plastic marine pollution occurrence along the Peruvian coast. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed in the sea, but the vertical transfer of MPs by marine organisms in coastal area is still poorly understood. In this study, we used laser direct infrared (LDIR) spectroscopy to determine the number and characteristics of MPs deposited by cultured oyster Crassostrea gigas and further compared the differences between MPs of natural deposit and biodeposit in field environments. The amounts of MPs found in the biodeposit of cultured oysters were 3.54 times greater than that in the natural deposition. The polymer types of biodeposit MPs also differed from those of natural deposition. It was estimated that a single oyster can deposit 15.88 MPs per day, which is a figure much higher than the initial results, and hotspots of MPs deposition may be formed within the oyster aquaculture area. We used generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to further infer the sources of MPs in sediments and found that distance to shore, cultured zone and urban center were important predictors of MPs abundance in sediments of aquaculture area. The above results suggest that cultured bivalves have an important capacity for MPs biodeposition and will further change the vertical distribution pattern of MPs in coastal environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Rivers are one of the main conduits that deliver plastic from land into the sea, and also act as reservoirs for plastic retention. Yet, our understanding of the extent of river exposure to plastic pollution remains limited. In particular, there has been no comprehensive quantification of the contributions from different river compartments, such as the water surface, water column, riverbank and floodplain to the overall river plastic transport and storage. This study aims to provide an initial quantification of these contributions. We first identified the main relevant transport processes for each river compartment considered. We then estimated the transport and storage terms, by harmonizing available observations on surface, suspended and floodplain plastic. We applied our approach to two river sections in The Netherlands, with a focus on macroplastics (≥2.5 cm). Our analysis revealed that for the studied river sections, suspended plastics account for over 96% of item transport within the river channel, while their relative contribution to mass transport is only 30%–37% (depending on the river section considered). Surface plastics predominantly consisted of heavier items (mean mass: 7.1 g/#), whereas suspended plastics were dominated by lighter fragments (mean mass: 0.1 g/#). Additionally, the majority (98%) of plastic mass was stored within the floodplains, with the river channel accounting for only 2% of the total storage. Our study developed a harmonized approach for quantifying plastic transport and storage across different river compartments, providing a replicable methodology applicable to different regions. Our findings emphasize the importance of systematic monitoring programs across river compartments for comprehensive insights into riverine plastic pollution. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have gained increasing attention in environmental research due to their ubiquitousness and potential impacts on natural environments and human health as per the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG-14 to address global threats where at least 12 SDGs, directly/indirectly impacts. Present review is undertaken to highlight the process of breakdown of diverse groups of plastic products in soil, surface water, and groundwater under the influence of different factors (UV, light, heat, microbe, etc.), which are mobilized as MPs/NPs to the surface water, groundwater, air, soil, and living organisms by different natural and anthropogenic processes. Review also highlights a comprehensive overview of the methodology for sampling, characterization, and analysis for these minuscule plastic particles (PPs) in various environmental samples, encompassing surface/subsurface water, sediments, soils, and biological organisms. The collection, extraction, and characterization of MPs/NPs, typically employ filtration processes, wherein a known volume of water is passed through a fine mesh to capture MPs/NPs from water samples. Sediment/soil samples require sieving and density separation techniques to isolate PPs from the surrounding matrix. Biological samples require digestion steps to remove organic matter, leaving behind plastics for analysis. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are commonly utilized to determine the polymer composition, size, shape, and surface characteristics of PPs. Quantification involves several approaches, visual counting, image analysis, and spectroscopic techniques. Abundance of MPs/NPs in the respective environmental samples (water, air, soil, etc.) can be determined by comparing the richness (i.e., number/mass) of plastics to the volume or weight of the original sample. Such comprehensive analytical methodologies contribute to understand the scope and magnitude of plastic pollution and its potential repercussions for ecosystems and human well-being, which are essential for developing the effective strategies to mitigate these pressing global environmental challenges for sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Understanding the interactions among flow-sediment, microorganisms, and biogeochemical cycles is crucial for comprehending the ecological response mechanisms of dams and water diversion. This study focused on the spatial patterns of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur (CNPS) cycle functional genes in the water resource for the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China, specifically the Danjiangkou Reservoir (comprising the Han and Dan reservoirs). The investigation incorporated sediment physicochemical properties and microplastic pollution. Numerous microbial species were identified, revealing that microbial communities demonstrated sensitivity to changes in sedimentary mud content. The communities exhibited greater β diversity due to finer sediment particles in the Han Reservoir (HR), whereas in the Dan Reservoir (DR), despite having higher sediment nutrient content and MPs pollution, did not display this pattern. Regarding the composition and structure of microbial communities, the study highlighted that sediment N and P content had a more significant influence compared to particle size and MPs. The quantitative microbial element cycling (QMEC) results confirmed the presence of extensive chemolithotrophic microbes and strong nitrogen cycle activity stemming from long-term water storage and diversion operations. The denitrification intensity in the HR surpassed that of the DR. Notably, near the pre-dam area, biological nitrogen fixation, phosphorus removal, and sulfur reduction exhibited noticeable increases. Dam construction refined sediment, fostering the growth of different biogeochemical cycling bacteria and increasing the abundance of CNPS cycling genes. Furthermore, the presence of MPs exhibited a positive correlation with S cycling genes and a negative correlation with C and N cycling genes. These findings suggest that variations in flow-sediment dynamics and MPs pollution have significant impact the biogeochemical cycle of the reservoir. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microfibers, a prevalent form of microplastics, undergo diverse environmental interactions resulting in varied morphological changes. These changes can offer insights into their environmental trajectories. Despite its importance, comprehensive studies on microfiber morphology are scarce. This study collected 233 microfibers from the East China Sea and South China Sea. Based on morphological features observed in microscopic images of microfibers, such as curvature, cross-sectional shapes, diameter variations, and crack shapes, we identified a general morphological pattern, classifying the environmental microfibers into three distinct morphological types. Our findings highlight noticeable differences in morphological metrics (e.g., length, diameter, and surface roughness) across three types, especially the diameter. Microfibers of Type I had an average diameter of 19.45 ± 4.93 μm, significantly smaller than Type II (263.00 ± 75.15 μm) and Type III (299.68 ± 85.62 μm). Within the three-dimensional (3D) space fully defined by these quantitative parameters, the clustering results of microfibers are also consistent with the proposed morphology pattern, with each category showing a potential correlation with specific chemical compositions. Type I microfibers correspond to synthetic cellulose, while 94.79 % of Types II and III are composed of polymers. Notably, we also validated the great applicability of the morphology categories to microfibers in diverse environmental compartments, including water and sediments in nearshore and offshore areas. This classification aids in the efficient determination of microfiber sources and the assessment of their ecological risks, marking a significant advancement in microfiber environmental studies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in the ocean is a global environmental hazard aggravated by poor management of plastic waste and growth of annual plastic consumption. Microbial communities colonizing the plastic's surface, the plastisphere, has gained global interest resulting in numerous efforts to characterize the plastisphere. However, there are insufficient studies deciphering the underlying metabolic processes governing the function of the plastisphere and the plastic they reside upon. Here, we collected plastic and seawater samples from Ashmore Reef in Australia to examine the planktonic microbes and plastic associated biofilm (PAB) to investigate the ecological impact, pathogenic potential, and plastic degradation capabilities of PAB in Ashmore Reef, as well as the role and impact of bacteriophages on PAB. Using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing, we demonstrated distinct microbial communities between seawater and PAB. Similar numbers of pathogenic bacteria were found in both sample types, yet plastic and seawater select for different pathogen populations. Virulence Factor analysis further illustrated stronger pathogenic potential in PAB, highlighting the pathogenicity of environmental PAB. Furthermore, functional analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways revealed xenobiotic degradation and fatty acid degradation to be enriched in PABs. In addition, construction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) and functional analysis further demonstrated the presence of a complete Polyethylene (PE) degradation pathway in multiple Proteobacteria MAGs, especially in Rhodobacteriaceae sp. Additionally, we identified viral population presence in PAB, revealing the key role of bacteriophages in shaping these communities within the PAB. Our result provides a comprehensive overview of the various ecological processes shaping microbial community on marine plastic debris. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution represents a global challenge that threatens ecosystems and human health. Because of this, there has been an increased interest in evaluating the use of phytotechnologies as a natural alternative for the removal of microplastics in water bodies. This study assessed the microplastic removal by Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs) consisting of linear arrays planted with Cyperus papyrus and Pontederia sagittata, installed in two urban ponds (“Pond 1” and “Pond 4”) located in the center of the city of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The results indicated that the two linear arrays of FTWs in Pond 1 (FTW1 and FTW2) efficiently removed microplastics in water column and sediments, with total removal rates of 82.4% and 81.1% respectively, despite having a high initial microplastic concentration. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the two FTWs in Pond 4 was mainly attributed to the first line of plants (FTW3), where the highest removal rates were observed, showing 61.6% in water column and 72.6% in sediments. However, the total removal of the two lines was 64.6% in water and 48.8% in sediments. C. papyrus and P. sagittata plants strongly retained microplastics in their roots, with concentrations of 16.4 and 11.9 mg/g respectively for FTW1 and FTW2 in Pond 1, and 2.1 and 6 mg/g for FTW3 and FTW 4 in Pond 4. These results suggest that the main removal microplastic mechanism was root retention, which facilitates microplastic removal from the aquatic environment by periodical root harvesting. Therefore, the crucial role of roots in the stabilization and reduction of these pollutants is highlighted. This study represents the first report in Mexico on the efficiency of FTWs in removing microplastics in urban water bodies. © 2023,\n",
       " The rise of plastics in the 20th century revolutionized modern life but inadvertently exacerbated the marine litter crisis. The proliferation of wastes such as single-use plastics has escalated pollution along the coastline, demanding coordinated, decisive, and unified action. While the absence of specific national marine litter policies is concerning, there is growing recognition of urgency to address this issue. A group of experts and stakeholders was involved through a multi-staged workshop to assess the generated information based on scientific evidence and formulate a framework for the National Marine Litter Policy (NMLP). This paper proposes policy options (4 targets & 20 strategies) to address marine litter pollution, especially plastics, and aims to elucidate the urgency and significance of implementing an NMLP as a comprehensive strategy to combat plastics pollution. Implementing dedicated policies and action plans tailored to the unique challenges faced by each country is a vital step towards sustainable oceans. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have been detected in various environmental matrices, drinking water, and food, and their presence is an ecological and human health concern. Most research on MPs has focused solely on their detection and analysis. However, sample pretreatment methods are critical for accurate MP analysis and must be properly established. In particular, freshwater sediment contains more impurities than other environment samples, thus requiring more elaborate sample pretreatment. Therefore, research on this media and corresponding pretreatment needs to be performed. Herein, we present a sample pretreatment method for analyzing MPs in freshwater sediments. Detailed factors in arriving at this pretreatment process were evaluated and discussed. Using this established pretreatment method, a total average recovery of six types of standard MPs (HDPE, LDPE, PS, PP, PET, and PVC) for sizes of ≥ 100 µm, 20–100 µm, and 1–20 µm was 94.0%, 90.2%, and 82.5%, respectively. After recovery validation, a modular pretreatment device was developed and combined with the established pretreatment method. The developed device performs density separation and organic matter removal, resulting in about 80% recovery of standard MPs. In addition, natural freshwater sediment samples were prepared using an established pretreatment method, and MPs in streams were analyzed using FTIR, TED-GC–MS, and Pyr-GC–MS. The device affords a low-cost, simple, efficient tool for sample pretreatment steps and easy MP recovery. Thus, it has great potential to simplify sample pretreatment steps for easy MP monitoring, especially for freshwater sediment samples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has engulfed global aquatic systems, and the concerns about microplastic translocation and bioaccumulation in fish and other aquatic organisms are now an unpleasant truth. In the past few years, MP pollution in freshwater systems, particularly rivers and subsequently in freshwater organisms, especially in fish, has caught the attention of researchers. Rivers provide livelihood to approximately 40 % of the global population through food and potable water. Hence, assessment of emerging contaminants like microplastics in rivers and the associated fauna is crucial. This study assessed microplastics (MPs) in fish, sediment and freshwater samples across the third largest riverine system of peninsular India, the Mahanadi River. The number concentrations of MPs measured in water, sediment and fish ranged from 337.5 ± 54.4–1333.3 ± 557.2 MPs/m3, 14.7 ± 3.7–69.3 ± 10.1 MPs/kg. Dry weight and 0.4–3.2 MPs/Fish, respectively. Surprisingly, MPs were found in every second fish sample, with a higher MP number in the gut than in the gills. Black and blue coloured filaments with <0.5 mm size were the dominant MPs with polypropylene and polyethylene polymers in abundance. The Polymer Hazard Index (PHI) and the Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI) studies revealed that the majority of the sampling sites fell in Risk category V (dangerous category). An irregular trend in the MP concentration was observed downstream of the river, though relatively elevated MP concentrations in water and fish samples were observed downstream of the river. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) unveiled distinct patterns in MP distribution with a higher similarity exhibited in the MPs found in fish gill and gut samples, unlike water and sediment, which shared certain characteristics. The findings in the current study contribute to filling the knowledge gap of MP assessment and accumulation in global freshwater systems and highlight the microplastic contamination and accumulation in fish with its potential implications on human health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is widespread throughout aquatic environments globally, with many organisms known to interact with and ingest plastic. In marine environments, microbial biofilms that form on plastic surfaces can produce the odorous compound dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is a known foraging cue. This has been shown to increase the ingestion of plastic by some invertebrates and therefore act as a biological factor which influences the risks of plastic to marine ecosystems. In freshwater however, the production of DMS has been largely overlooked, despite the known sensitivity of some freshwater species to this compound. To address this gap, the present study analyzed the production of DMS by biofilms which formed on low-density polyethylene and polylactic acid films after 3 and 6 weeks of submersion in either a rural or an urban United Kingdom river. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, the production of DMS by these biofilms was consistently identified. The amount of DMS produced varied significantly across river locations and materials, with surfaces in the urban river generally producing a stronger signal and plastics producing up to seven times more DMS than glass control surfaces. Analysis of biofilm weight and photosynthetic pigment content indicated differences in biofilm composition across conditions and suggested that DMS production was largely driven by nonphotosynthetic taxa. For the first time this work has documented the production of DMS by plastic litter after submersion in freshwater rivers. Further work is now needed to determine if, as seen in marine systems, this production of DMS can encourage the interaction of freshwater organisms with plastic litter and therefore operate as a biological risk factor in the impacts of plastic on freshwater environments.

       " Procellariiform seabirds can accumulate high levels of plastic in their gastrointestinal tracts, which can cause physical damage and potentially provides a contamination route for trace elements. We examined plastic ingestion and trace element contamination of fledgling Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus that were harvested for human consumption in 2003 and 2018 on Skúvoy, Faroe Islands (North Atlantic Ocean). Overall, 88% of fledglings contained plastic in their gastrointestinal tracts, with a mean (± SD) of 7.2 ± 6.6 items weighing 0.007 ± 0.016 g. Though the incidence was similar, fledglings ingested significantly more plastic in 2018 compared to 2003. Hepatic trace element concentrations were unrelated to plastic ingestion. Hepatic carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope values were significantly lower in birds sampled in 2018 versus 2003, potentially reflecting further offshore feeding at lower trophic levels. Future research is needed to understand the extent of plastic ingestion by Faroe Islands seabirds. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Anadara granosa or blood cockles have been reported to be a candidate for biomonitoring agents due to their sedimentary nature and their nutrient uptake mechanisms. Yet, this bivalve is still regarded as a delicacy in Asian cuisine. Malaysia is the largest exporter of this sea product that contaminated cockles may also be experienced by the importing countries. However, the bioaccumulation of microplastics in A. granosa cultivated in Malaysia has not been extensively studied. It is crucial to comprehend the risk posed to humans by consuming A. granosa in their diet. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate the levels of microplastic accumulation in A. granosa from major exporters in Peninsular Malaysia, to evaluate the associated risk of microplastics on the species, and to estimate daily human consumption of microplastics through the consumption of A. granosa. The abundance of microplastics was quantified through the use of a stereo microscope, and the polymer type was determined using FTIR and micro-FTIR. Findings from this investigation revealed that all samples of A. granosa were contaminated with microplastics, with the highest levels of accumulation found in bivalves collected from the west coast (0.26 ± 0.15 particles/g) of Peninsular Malaysia. Fragment and fiber microplastics, measuring between 0.05 and 0.1 mm in size, were found to be the most prevalent in A. granosa, with blue being the dominant identified colour and rayon being the most common polymer type. Microplastic risk assessment due to the presence of polyacrylate, polycarbonate (PC), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resulted in a high risk of contamination for A. granosa. It was further determined that the current estimated dietary intake (EDI) suggests that consumers of A. granosa uptake approximately 21.8–93.5 particles/person/year of microplastics. This study highlights that A. granosa accumulates microplastics, which could potentially result in bioaccumulation and biomagnification in humans through consumption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In recent years micro- and nanoplastics and metal-oxide nanomaterials have been found in several environmental compartments. The Antarctic soft clam Laternula elliptica is an endemic Antarctic species having a wide distribution in the Southern Ocean. Being a filter-feeder, it could act as suitable bioindicator of pollution from nanoparticles also considering its sensitivity to various sources of stress. The present study aims to assess the impact of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NP) and the nanometal titanium-dioxide (n-TiO2) on genome-wide transcript expression of L. elliptica either alone and in combination and at two toxicological relevant concentrations (5 and 50 µg/L) during 96 h exposure. Transcript-target qRT-PCR was performed with the aim to identify suitable biomarkers of exposure and effects. As expected, at the highest concentration tested, the clustering was clearer between control and exposed clams. A total of 221 genes resulted differentially expressed in exposed clams and control ones, and 21 of them had functional annotation such as ribosomal proteins, antioxidant, ion transport (osmoregulation), acid-base balance, immunity, lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, apoptosis, chromatin condensation and cell signaling. At functional level, relevant transcripts were shared among some treatments and could be considered as general stress due to nanoparticle exposure. After applying transcript-target approach duplicating the number of clam samples, four ecologically relevant transcripts were revealed as biomarkers for PS-NP, n-TiO2 and their combination at 50 µg/L, that could be used for monitoring clams’ health status in different Antarctic localities. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " To investigate the escalating issue of microplastic (MP), pollution in urban water bodies, this study focuses on the aftermath of the Brahmapuram landfill fire in Kochi, India, analyzing its impact on MP concentrations in nearby freshwater system. The study conducted sampling sessions at the landfill site immediately before and after the fire. Post-fire, findings demonstrated a substantial increase in MP concentrations in surface waters, with levels rising from an average 25793.33 to 44863.33 particles/m³, featuring a notable presence of larger, predominantly black MPs. Sediment samples showed no significant change in MP count, but there was a significant increase in mass concentration. SEM/EDS analysis revealed changes in surface morphology and elemental composition, suggesting thermal degradation. Risk assessment using the Microplastic Pollution Index (MPI) and Risk Quotient (RQ) methods indicated heightened MP pollution risk in surface water post-fire. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed the landfill's proximity as a significant factor influencing MP characteristics in the aquatic system. The study highlights the escalated challenge of MP pollution in urban water bodies following environmental disasters like landfill fires, underscoring the urgent need for policy and environmental management strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This paper aims to emphasize the occurrence of various emerging contaminant (EC) mixtures in natural ecosystems and highlights the primary concern arising from the unregulated release into soil and water, along with their impacts on human health. Emerging contaminant mixtures, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, antibiotics, biocides, surfactants, phthalates, enteric viruses, and microplastics (MPs), are considered toxic contaminants with grave implications. MPs play a crucial role in transporting pollutants to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as they interact with the various components of the soil and water environments. This review summarizes that major emerging contaminants (ECs), like trimethoprim, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, and 17α-Ethinylestradiol, pose serious threats to public health and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. In addressing human health concerns and remediation techniques, this review critically evaluates conventional methods for removing ECs from complex matrices. The diverse physiochemical properties of surrounding environments facilitate the partitioning of ECs into sediments and other organic phases, resulting in carcinogenic, teratogenic, and estrogenic effects through active catalytic interactions and mechanisms mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptors. The proactive toxicity of ECs mixture complexation and, in part, the yet-to-be-identified environmental mixtures of ECs represent a blind spot in current literature, necessitating conceptual frameworks for assessing the toxicity and risks with individual components and mixtures. Lastly, this review concludes with an in-depth exploration of future scopes, knowledge gaps, and challenges, emphasizing the need for a concerted effort in managing ECs and other organic pollutants. © 2024,\n",
       " Nitrogen removal is essential for restoring eutrophic lakes. Microorganisms and aquatic plants in lakes are both crucial for removing excess nitrogen. However, microplastic (MP) pollution and the invasion of exotic aquatic plants have become increasingly serious in lake ecosystems due to human activity and plant-dominant traits. This field mesocosm study explored how the diversity of invasive submerged macrophytes affects denitrification (DNF), anammox (ANA), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in lake sediments with varying MPs. Results showed that invasive macrophytes suppressed DNF rates, but DNRA and ANA were less sensitive than DNF to the diversity of invasive species. Sediment MPs increased the biomass of invasive species more than native species, but did not affect microbial processes. The effects of MPs on nitrate dissimilatory reduction were process-specific. MPs increased DNF rates and the competitive advantage of DNF over DNRA by changing the sediment environment. The decoupling of DNF and ANA was also observed, with increased DNF rates and decreased ANA rates. The study findings suggested new insights into how the invasion of exotic submerged macrophytes affects the sediment nitrogen cycle complex environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Conventional plastics are inherently difficult to degrade, causing serious plastic pollution. With the development of society, biodegradable plastics (BPs) are considered as an alternative to traditional plastics. However, current research indicated that BPs do not undergo complete degradation in natural environments. Instead, they may convert into biodegradable microplastics (BMPs) at an accelerated rate, thereby posing a significant threat to environment. In this paper, the definition, application, distribution, degradation behaviors, bioaccumulation and biomagnification of BPs were reviewed. And the impacts of BMPs on soil and marine ecosystems, in terms of physicochemical property, nutrient cycling, microorganisms, plants and animals were comprehensively summarized. The effects of combined exposure of BMPs with other pollutants, and the mechanism of ecotoxicity induced by BMPs were also addressed. It was found that BMPs reduced pH, increased DOC content, and disrupted the nitrification of nitrogen cycle in soil ecosystem. The shoot dry weight, pod number and root growth of soil plants, and reproduction and body length of soil animals were inhibited by BMPs. Furthermore, the growth of marine plants, and locomotion, body length and survival of marine animals were suppressed by BMPs. Additionally, the ecotoxicity of combined exposure of BMPs with other pollutants has not been uniformly concluded. Exposure to BMPs induced several types of toxicity, including neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity and genotoxicity. The future calls for heightened attention towards the regulation of the degradation of BPs in the environment, and pursuit of interventions aimed at mitigating their ecotoxicity and potential health risks to human. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Both sediments and microplastics (MPs) are medias of heavy metals (HMs) in river ecosystems. This study investigated HMs (Mn, Cr, V, As, Cu, Co, Cd, Pb, and Ni) concentration and driving factors for competitive enrichment between hyporheic sediments versus MPs. The medias basic characteristics indicated that the sediments were mostly sand and rich in Fe2O3; three polymer types were identified, with blue, fragment, less than 500 µm being the main types of MPs. The results have shown that the average content of extracted HMs in MPs was much higher than that of the same metals accumulated in sediments. HMs in sediments and MPs reached heavily polluted at some points, among which As and Cd were ecological risks. Electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation, and biofilm-mediated and organic matter complexation were the interaction mechanism of HMs with sediments and MPs. Further, the driving factors affecting the distribution of HMs in the two carriers were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis. The results demonstrated that carrier characteristics, hydrochemical factors, and the inherent metal load of MPs were the main causes of the high HMs content. These findings improved our understanding of HMs fate and environmental risks across multiple medias. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Despite increasing awareness of microplastic pollution and the harm it brings to terrestrial ecosystems and human body, few research works have examined how it contributes to freshwater environments, particularly forest reserves. Microplastic presence and characteristics were examined in Mindanao's Taguibo River Watershed Forest Reserve (TRWFR). Three (3) sampling sites along the river stretch were chosen. Analysis of water and sediment samples found microplastic abundances at 477.78 ± 182.83 pa/m3 and 17.04 ± 14.80 pa/kg, respectively. These microplastics varied in size, shape, and color. A total of 9 and 7 color variations were detected from water and sediment samples, respectively. Brown (43.02%) and black (17.44%), and fibers (39.53%) and films (24.42%) were the most common microplastics from water samples. White (30.43%), and blue and brown (21.74%), and filament (69.57%) were the most common microplastics from sediment samples. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy described the microplastics further. A total of 13 polymer types were identified in water samples, while 8 polymer types were identified in sediment samples. Polymer types such as polyacetylene and regenerated cellulose fibers were mostly found in water samples; and polypropylene and regenerated cellulose fibers from sediment samples. This study shows microplastic pollution in the TRWFR. Microplastic incidence and distribution patterns vary among collection locations, suggesting some areas are more susceptible to pollution. This work improves our understanding of freshwater microplastic contamination and underscores the need to monitor and reduce microplastic pollution to preserve the ecological balance in the Taguibo River and its surroundings.  © 2024 King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok.,\n",
       " Water bodies play a crucial role in supporting life, maintaining the environment, and preserving the ecology for the people of India. However, in recent decades, human activities have led to various alterations in aquatic environments, resulting in environmental degradation through pollution. The safety of utilizing surface water sources for drinking and other purposes has come under intense scrutiny due to rapid population growth and industrial expansion. Surface water pollution due to micro-plastics (MPs) (plastics < 5 mm in size) is one of the emerging pollutants in metropolitan cities of developing countries because of its utmost resilience and synthetic nature. Recent studies on the surface water bodies (river, pond, Lake etc.) portrait the correlation between the MPs level with different parameters of pollution such as specific conductivity, total phosphate, and biological oxygen demand. Fibers represent the predominant form of MPs discovered in surface water bodies, exhibiting fluctuations across seasons. Consequently, present study prioritizes understanding the adaptation, prevalence, attributes, fluctuations, and spatial dispersion of MPs in both sediment and surface water environments. Furthermore, the study aims to identify existing gaps in the current understanding and underscore opportunities for future investigation. From the present study, it has been reported that, the concentration of MPs in the range of 0.2–45.2 items/L at the Xisha Islands in the south China sea, whereas in India it was found in the range of 96 items/L in water samples and 259 items/kg in sediment samples. This would certainly assist the urban planners in achieving sustainable development goals to mitigate the increasing amount of emergent pollutant load. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.,\n",
       " As one of the main components of marine pollution, microplastics (MPs) inevitably enter the mussel aquaculture environment. At the same time, pathogenic bacteria, especially pathogens such as Vibrio, can cause illness outbreaks, leading to large-scale death of mussels. The potential harm of MPs and pathogenic bacteria to bivalve remains unclear. This study designed two experiments (1) mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed to 100 particles/L or 1,000 particles/L polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, 17.01 ± 6.74 μm) MPs and 1 × 107 CFU/mL Vibrio parahaemolyticus at the same time (14 days), and (2) mussels were exposed to 100 particles/L or 1,000 particles/L MPs for a long time (30 days) and then exposed to 1 × 107 CFU/mL V. parahaemolyticus to explore the effects of these two stresses on the mussel immune system. The results showed that after the combined exposure of V. parahaemolyticus and MPs, the lysosomal membrane stability of hemocytes decreased, lysozyme activity was inhibited, and hemocytes were induced to produce more lectins and defensins to fight pathogenic invasion. Long-term exposure to MPs caused a large amount of energy consumption in mussels, inhibited most of the functions of humoral immunity, increased the risk of mussel infection with pathogenic bacteria, and negatively affected mussel condition factor, the number of hemocytes, and the number of byssuses. Mussels may allocate more energy to deal with MPs and pathogenic bacterial infections rather than for growth. Above all, MPs exposure can affect mussel immune function or reduce its stress resistance, which in turn has an impact on mollusk farming. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a global concern due to its potential impacts on the environment, ecosystem services and human health. The goals of the present study were to document the MP contamination in wild specimens of Mytilus galloprovincialis sampled along the Atlantic coast of the North region of Portugal continental (NW Portuguese coast), and to estimate the human risk of MP intake (HRI) through the consumption of local mussels as seafood. Mussels were collected at four sampling sites along the NW Portuguese coast (40 mussels per site), and the whole soft body of each mussel was analysed for MP content. HRI estimates were based on the mean of MP items per wet weight of mussel analysed tissue (MP/g) and consumption habits. A total of 132 MP items were recovered from mussels. MP had diverse sizes (98–2690 μm) and colours. The most common shapes were fibres (39%) and pellets (36%). Five polymers were identified in the MP: polyethylene (50%), polystyrene (15%), poly(ethylene vinyl acetate) (14%), polyamide (12%) and polypropylene (9%). From the 160 analysed mussels, 55% had MP. The mean and standard error of the mean of mussel contamination ranged from 0.206 ± 0.067 and 0.709 ± 0.095 MP/g. Compared to estimates based on MP contamination in mussels from other areas and varied consumption habits, the HRI through the consumption of mussels from the NW Portuguese coast is relatively low. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics pose significant challenges to ecosystems and organisms. They can be ingested by marine and terrestrial species, leading to potential health risks and ecological disruptions. This study aims to address the urgent need for effective remediation strategies by focusing on the biodegradation of microplastics, specifically polyvinyl chloride (PVC) derivatives, using the bacterial strain Bacillus albus. The study provides a comprehensive background on the accumulation of noxious substances in the environment and the importance of harnessing biodegradation as an eco-friendly method for pollutant elimination. The specific objective is to investigate the enzymatic capabilities of Bacillus albus, particularly the alpha/beta hydrolases (ABH), in degrading microplastics. To achieve this, in-silico studies were conducted, including analysis of the ABH protein sequence and its interaction with potential inhibitors targeting PVC derivatives. Docking scores of − 7.2 kcal/mol were obtained to evaluate the efficacy of the interactions. The study demonstrates the promising bioremediation prospects of Bacillus albus for microplastics, highlighting its potential as a key player in addressing microplastic pollution. The findings underscore the urgent need for further experimental validation and practical implementation of Bacillus albus in environmental remediation strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.,\n",

The objective of this review is to provide better understanding prevalence and distribution of microplastics, factors influencing their concentration and transport, the sampling technique and polymer identification analysis used in various studies and future research needs. The identification of microplastic polymer types is also explored, including techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. It also points out the many types of sampling equipment and materials, as well as sample preparation and analysis. Sampling method and polymer identification analysis of microplastics may vary on the circumstances of the location and question of the research.

       " Plastic pollution in the natural environment poses a growing threat to ecosystems and human health, prompting urgent needs for monitoring, prevention and clean-up measures, and new policies. To effectively prioritize resource allocation and mitigation strategies, it is key to identify and define plastic hotspots. UNEP's draft global agreement on plastic pollution mandates prioritizing hotspots, suggesting a potential need for a defined term. Yet, the delineation of hotspots varies considerably across plastic pollution studies, and a definition is often lacking or inconsistent without a clear purpose and boundaries of the term. In this paper, we applied four common definitions of hotspot locations to plastic pollution datasets ranging from urban areas to a global scale. Our findings reveal that these hotspot definitions encompass between 0.8 % to 93.3 % of the total plastic pollution, covering <0.1 % to 50.3 % of the total locations. Given this wide range of results and the possibility of temporal inconsistency in hotspots, we emphasize the need for fit-for-purpose criteria and a unified approach to defining plastic hotspots. Therefore, we designed a step-wise framework to define hotspots by determining the purpose, units, spatial scale, temporal scale, and threshold values. Incorporating these steps in research and policymaking yields a harmonized definition of hotspots, facilitating the development of effective plastic pollution prevention and reduction measures. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp increase in disposable surgical mask usage. Discarded masks can release microplastic and cause environmental pollution. Since masks have become a daily necessity for protection against virus infections, it is necessary to review the usage and disposal of masks during the pandemic for future management. In this study, we constructed a dynamic model by introducing related parameters to estimate daily mask usage in 214 countries from January 22, 2020 to July 31, 2022. And we validated the accuracy of our model by establishing a dataset based on published survey data. Our results show that the cumulative mask usage has reached 800 billion worldwide, and the microplastics released from discarded masks due to mismanagement account for 3.27% of global marine microplastic emissions in this period. Furthermore, we illustrated the response relationship between mask usage and the infection rates. We found a marginally significant negative correlation existing between the mean daily per capita mask usage and the rate of cumulative confirmed cases within the range of 25% to 50%. This indicates that if the rate reaches the specified threshold, the preventive effect of masks may become evident. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marine organisms commonly encounter co-stress resulting from the coexistence of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals pollution in marine environments. Nevertheless, the combined effects and toxicity mechanisms of MPs and heavy metals on marine organisms remain unclear. This study integrated growth, physiological, morphological, and biochemical markers to assess the individual and combined toxicity of polyvinyl chloride MPs (PVC MPs, 1 × 104 particles/L) and copper (Cu, 200 μg/L) on marine jacopever (Sebastes schlegelii). The results revealed that co-exposure to MPs and Cu had a more detrimental impact on jacopever compared to the single-exposure groups, as evidenced by the enhanced growth inhibition, respiratory stress, and hepatotoxicity. This phenomenon may be attributed to PVC MPs accelerating the accumulation of Cu in jacopever liver. Therefore, peroxidation damage occurred in the co-exposed liver and may result in liver dysfunction. These findings contribute valuable insights into the risks associated with the coexistence of MPs and heavy metal pollution in marine ecosystems. © 2024,\n",
       " The worldwide mangrove shorelines are experiencing considerable contamination from microplastics (MPs). Finding an effective sentinel species in the mangrove ecosystem is crucial for early warning of ecological and human health risks posed by coastal microplastic pollution. This study collected 186 specimens of the widely distributed mangrove clam (Geloina expansa, Solander, 1786) from 18 stations along the Leizhou Peninsula, the largest mangrove coast in Southern China. This study discovered that mangrove mud clams accumulated a relatively high abundance of MPs (2.96 [1.61 – 6.03] items·g-1) in their soft tissue, wet weight, as compared to previously reported levels in bivalves. MPs abundance is significantly (p < 0.05 or 0.0001) influenced by coastal urban development, aquaculture, and shell size. Furthermore, the aggregated MPs exhibit a significantly high polymer risk index (Level III, H = 353.83). The estimated annual intake risk (EAI) from resident consumption, as calculated via a specific questionnaire survey, was at a moderate level (990 – 2475, items·g -1·Capita -1). However, the EAI based on suggested nutritional standards is very high, reaching 113,990 (79,298 − 148,681), items·g -1·Capita -1. We recommend utilizing the mangrove mud clam as sentinel species for the monitoring of MPs pollution changing across global coastlines. © 2024,\n",
       " Nanoplastic pollution typically exhibits more biotoxicity to marine organisms than microplastic pollution. Limited research exists on the toxic effects of small-sized nanoplastics on marine fish, especially regarding their post-exposure resilience. In this study, red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) were exposed to small-sized polystyrene nanoplastics (30 nm, PS-NPs) for 7 days for the exposure experiments, followed by 14 days of recovery experiments. Histologically, hepatic lipid droplets and branchial epithelial liftings were the primary lesions induced by PS-NPs during both exposure and recovery periods. The inhibition of total superoxide dismutase activity and the accumulation of malondialdehyde content throughout the exposure and recovery periods. Transcriptional and metabolic regulation revealed that PS-NPs induced lipid metabolism disorders and DNA damage during the initial 1–2 days of exposure periods, followed by immune responses and neurotoxicity in the later stages (4–7 days). During the early recovery stages (2–7 days), lipid metabolism and cell cycle were activated, while in the later recovery stage (14 days), the emphasis shifted to lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. Persistent histological lesions, changes in antioxidant capacity, and fluctuations in gene and metabolite expression were observed even after 14 days of recovery periods, highlighting the severe biotoxicity of small-sized PS-NPs to marine fish. In summary, small-sized PS-NPs have severe biotoxicity, causing tissue lesions, oxidative damage, lipid metabolism disorders, DNA damage, immune responses, and neurotoxicity in red drum. This study offers valuable insights into the toxic effects and resilience of small-sized nanoplastics on marine fish. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The presence and persistence of microplastics (MPs) in diverse aquatic environments are of global concern. Microplastics can impact marine organisms via direct physical interaction and the release of potentially harmful chemical additives incorporated into the plastic. These chemicals are physically bound to the plastic matrix and can leach out. The hazards associated with chemical additives to exposed organisms is not well characterized. We investigated the hazards of plastic additives leaching from plastic. We used the common plasticizer dibutyl phthalate (DBP) as a chemical additive proxy and the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) as a model. We used early-adult P. canaliculus exposed to combinations of virgin and DBP-spiked polyvinyl chloride (PVC), MPs, and DBP alone for 7 days. Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted to assess whether leaching of DBP from MPs poses a hazard. The differences between groups were evaluated using pairwise permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), and all treatments were significantly different from controls. In addition, a significant difference was seen between DBP and PVC MP treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that mussels exposed to DBP alone had the most differentially expressed genes (914), followed by PVC MP + DBP (448), and PVC MP (250). Gene ontology functional analysis revealed that the most enriched pathway types were in cellular metabolism, immune response, and endocrine disruption. Microplastic treatments enriched numerous pathways related to cellular metabolism and immune response. The combined exposure of PVC MP + DBP appears to cause combined effects, suggesting that DBP is bioavailable to the exposed mussels in the PVC MP + DBP treatment. Our results support the hypothesis that chemical additives are potentially an important driver of MP toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2024;43:1604–1614. © 2024 The Authors.

       " The increasing interfacial impacts of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) complex aquatic environments are becoming more evident, drawing attention to the potential risks to aquatic animal health and human seafood safety. This study aims to investigate the relative impacts following exposure (7 days) of Crassostrea hongkongensis oysters to the traditional PFAS congener, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at 50 μg/L, and its novel alternative, hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), also known as GenX at 50 μg/L, in conjunction with fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics (PS, 80 nm) at 1 mg/L. The research focuses on assessing the effects of combined exposure on oxidative stress responses and gut microbiota in the C. hongkongensis. Comparing the final results of PS + GenX (PG) and PS + PFOA (PF) groups, we observed bioaccumulation of PS in both groups, with the former causing more pronounced histopathological damage to the gills and intestines. Furthermore, the content of antioxidant enzymes induced by PG was higher than that of PF, including Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Reductase (GR) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH). Additionally, in both PG and PF groups, the expression levels of several immune-related genes were significantly upregulated, including tnfα, cat, stat, tlr-4, sod, and β-gbp, with no significant difference between these two groups (p > 0.05). Combined exposure induced significant changes in the gut microbiota of C. hongkongensis at its genus level, with a significant increase in Legionella and a notable decrease in Endozoicomonas and Lactococcus caused by PG. These shifts led to beneficial bacteria declining and pathogenic microbes increasing. Consequently, the microbial community structure might be disrupted. In summary, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the comparative toxicities of marine bivalves under combined exposure of traditional and alternative PFAS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics, an emerging contaminant, are widespread in oceans around the world, and rivers are the key conveyors of these pollutants into the oceans. There exists a dearth of available data pertaining to seasonal fluctuation, spatial distribution and risk assessment of microplastics in rivers extending from upper reaches to the lower reaches. The collection of such data is of utmost importance for the purpose of formulating beneficial management strategies for riverine microplastics. In order to bridge this research gap, an investigation was made in the Periyar River in Kerala, India, which is exposed to anthropogenic stress and is at risk of microplastic pollution. A total of eighteen sites (six sites each from downstream, midstream and upstream) along the 244 km of the river were investigated across three seasons in a year. The study revealed a discernible pattern in the spatial distribution of microplastic concentrations, wherein there was a rise in abundance from the upstream to midstream and then a sudden increase of abundance along the downstream regions towards the lower reaches. The highest mean microplastic abundance of 124.95 items/L was obtained during the monsoon season followed by post-monsoon season i.e. 123.21 items/L and pre-monsoon i.e. 120.50 items/L. The predominant forms of microplastics were found to be fibres, fragments and filaments. Most prevalent polymer types acquired were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Pollution hazard index (PHI) and pollution load index (PLI) were also evaluated to assess the water quality of this river. The findings of this study conclude that the Periyar River is polluted with microplastics throughout its course and offer significant insights into the detection of microplastic origins in river systems and lend support to the implementation of potential measures aimed at mitigating their impact. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Stated preference (SP) research on willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements to wildlife populations focuses almost universally on measures related to whether organisms live or die. Preferences for changes in non-lethal harm to wildlife are generally overlooked. To evaluate the consequences, this article develops a theoretical model and corresponding discrete choice experiment (DCE) to evaluate whether and how the omission of information on non-lethal wildlife harm influences WTP estimation, grounded in a case study of marine plastic reductions in the North Atlantic. The theoretical model suggests that when environmental programs have both lethal and non-lethal impacts on wild species, DCEs that omit information on the latter may not produce valid welfare measures. Empirical results show that the omission of this information has multiple impacts on welfare estimates, largely consistent with theoretical predictions. Results suggest that welfare estimates for wildlife improvements can be confounded by the omission of information on non-lethal harm from SP scenarios. Results also demonstrate the hazards of excluding potentially welfare-relevant information from SP scenarios when respondents might assume relationships between omitted information and other material included in the questionnaire. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Marine microplastics, categorized as primary and secondary, including synthetic microfibers like polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and acrylic (PC), represent a potential environmental concern. The complex classification of these fibers, originating from diverse sources such as textiles and many others commercial goods, prompts a need for understanding their impact on aquatic organisms. This study assesses the ecological risks associated with both natural and synthetic fibers in aquatic ecosystems, focusing on toxicity data and their effects on taxonomic groups like Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, Cnidaria, and Chordata. To carry out species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curves, a comprehensive analysis of scientific literature was conducted, collecting toxicity data related to various fibers. The resulting SSDs provide insights into the relative sensitivity of different taxonomic groups. The potential ecological risks were evaluated by comparing measured concentrations in diverse aquatic environments with Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) values. The calculation of Risk Quotient (RQ) allowed to indicate areas where fibers abundance poses a potential threat to aquatic organisms. The study reveals that nylon fibers can pose the highest toxicity risk, especially in Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, Arabian Gulf and VietNam river. Mollusca emerged as particularly sensitive to different fiber types, likely due to their body structure facilitating the accumulation of microfibers. The research emphasizes the urgent need for further studies to get data to human health risk analysis and to address comprehensive environmental management strategies to address the global issue of microfiber pollution. © 2024,\n",
       " The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of microplastic in digestive organs (esophagus to intestine) of popular marine commercial fish species: Jack (Caranx SP.), blackspot snapper (Lutjanus fulviflamma), coral grouper (Epinephelus carallicala), golden snapper (Lutjanus johnii) and pickhandle barracuda (Sphyraena jello) from Pangempang Estuary in Indonesia. To separate the microplastic particles, each sample was digested using alkaline digestion solution, filtered on Whatman paper and then dried. Microplastic particles in the processed digestive organ contents were identified and enumerated using a dissecting stereo microscope. Microplastics were observed in 94 % of fish digestive organs sampled: 100 % jacks (n = 10), 80 % blackspot snapper (n = 10), 100 % coral grouper (n = 10), 90 % golden snapper (n = 10) and 100 % pickhandle barracuda (n = 10). In these fish samples we found in average of 41 ± 6.0, 26 ± 11.0, 15 ± 2.0, 11 ± 1.0 and 14 ± 2.0 SE microplastic particles per individual and an average of 499.5 ± 94.4, 501.5 ± 198.8, 83.6 ± 18.4, 79.8 ± 11.6 and 40.2 ± 25.0 SE microplastic particles per kg fish weight, in jacks, blackspot snapper, coral grouper, golden snapper and pickhandle barracuda, respectively. Fiber was the most dominant type accounting for 78.6 % of all observed microplastics. Microplastic beads were not detected. The correlation of the average consumed microplastic and the average fish weight per species showed a negative relationship (R2 = 0.36), but was not significant (p-value = 0.28). Our finding suggests that demersal fish like jacks, blackspot snapper and coral grouper may have ingested a higher quantity of microplastic particles compared to pelagic species like pickhandle barracuda. © 2024, Walailak University.

       " The pollution of waste plastic microfragments to the marine ecosystems is an increasingly serious problem. Pyrolysis is widely recognized as a viable technique for the treatment of such plastic waste materials. The pyrolysis behaviors, characteristic parameters, kinetics, thermodynamics, volatiles, and possible chemical reactions during the pyrolysis of micron polyamide waste (the main component of fishing gear abandoned in the marine environment) are studied in inert atmosphere in the present work. The results show that the pyrolysis of micron polyamide may be regarded as a one-step reaction. The peak and average reaction rates decrease significantly when the heating rate increases. The calculated kinetic parameters can effectively predict the pyrolysis behaviors of micron polyamide. The pyrolysis of micron polyamide is characterized as an endothermic reaction that occurs non-spontaneously. Furthermore, the information of volatiles was obtained. The volatiles with higher content were –CH2 groups, CO2, and lactam, and the volatiles with smaller content were: –NH groups, NH3, HCN, H2O, CO, and amide derivatives. In addition, an analysis was conducted to explore the potential chemical reactions. Highlights: The pyrolysis of micron polyamide can be considered as a one-step reaction. The obtained kinetic parameters can well predict the pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis of micron polyamide is a non-spontaneous and endothermic reaction. Specific volatile products are determined by Fourier transform infrared and mass spectrometry. The chemical reactions that may occur during the pyrolysis have been inferred. © 2024 Society of Plastics Engineers.,\n",
       " Contamination of river water systems by microplastic particles (MPPs) is one of the emerging global environmental concerns with potentially widespread ecological, socioeconomic, and health implications. A wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes and treats wastewater to remove pollutants and release safe water into the environment. There has been limited research on the characterization of microplastics and their removal in WWTP in South Asia. In this work, we report on the characterization of microplastics in wastewater and sludge samples (n = 300) from Guheshwori WWTP located on the bank of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu city, Nepal representing inlet, secondary aeration tank (SAT), outlet, and sludge from November 2021 to November 2022. On average, we detected 31.2 ± 17.3 MPPs/L, 11.2 ± 9.4 MPPs/L, 8.5 ± 5.6 MPPs/L, and 6.6 ± 4.8 MPPs/g in the samples collected from inlet, SAT, outlet, and sludge, respectively. Commonly found MPPs were in the form of fiber, fragments, foam, and pellets. Largely, MPPs were red, yellow, white, blue, and black. Among the 44 μm – 150 μm, 150 μm – 500 μm and 500 μm – 5 mm categories of size fractions, the most dominant fractions were 500 μm – 150 μm in inlet, SAT, and sludge, and 150 μm – 44 μm in the outlet sampling unit. The Guheshwori WWTP was able to remove 72.5 % of MPPs on average, that mostly occurred in the inlet. The effluent released into the river and the sludge still contained a significant number of MPPs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The Mediterranean region is both a hotspot for biodiversity and for the accumulation of plastic pollution. Many species are exposed to this pollution while feeding, including a wide diversity of seabirds. Our objective was to investigate spatial variation in the quantity and types of plastic ingested by Yellow-legged gulls using information obtained from regurgitated pellets collected in 11 colonies. Anthropogenic debris, and particularly plastic, was found in pellets from all colonies, but the amount varied considerably. This among-colony difference was stable over the two years of study. The presence of marine prey and the proportion of agricultural area around the colonies significantly influenced the number of ingested plastics. As landfills close and garbage management improves, the availability of anthropogenic waste should decline. Following the response of gulls to these changes will be particularly useful for monitoring plastic pollution and for understanding the response of opportunistic wildlife to environmental modifications. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Heteroaggregation between polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and soot nanoparticles (STNPs) in aquatic environments may affect their fate and transport. This study investigated the effects of particle concentration ratio, electrolytes, pH, and humic acid on their heteroaggregation kinetics. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) ranked CCCPSNPs > CCCPSNPs-STNPs > CCCSTNPs, indicating that heteroaggregation rates fell between homoaggregation rates. In NaCl solution, as the PSNPs/STNPs ratio decreased from 9/1 to 3/7, heteroaggregation rate decreased and CCCPSNPs-STNPs increased from 200 to 220 mM due to enhanced electrostatic repulsion. Outlier was observed at PSNPs/STNPs= 1/9, where CCCPSNPs-STNPs= 170 mM and homoaggregation of STNPs dominated. However, in CaCl2 solution where calcium bridged with STNPs, heteroaggregation rate increased and CCCPSNPs-STNPs decreased from 26 to 5 mM as the PSNPs/STNPs ratio decreasing from 9/1 to 1/9. In composite water samples, heteroaggregation occurred only at estuarine and marine salinities. Acidic condition promoted heteroaggregation via charge screening. Humic acid retarded or promoted heteroaggregation in NaCl or CaCl2 solutions by steric hindrance or calcium bridging, respectively. Other than van der Waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion, heteroaggregation was affected by steric hindrance, hydrophobic interactions, π − π interactions, and calcium bridging. The results highlight the role of black carbon on colloidal stability of PSNPs in aquatic environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics, an emerging pollutant, have garnered widespread attention due to potential repercussions on human health and the environment. Given the critical role of seafood in food security, growing concerns about microplastics might be detrimental to meeting future global food demand. This study employed a discrete choice experiment to investigate Chilean consumers’ preferences for technology aimed at mitigating microplastic levels in mussels. Using a between-subjects design with information treatments, we examined the impact of informing consumers about potential human health and environmental effects linked to microplastics pollution on their valuation for the technology. We found that the information treatments increased consumers’ willingness to pay for mussels. Specifically, consumers were willing to pay a premium of around US$ 4 for 250 g of mussel meat with a 90 % depuration efficiency certification. The provision of health impact information increased the price premium by 56 %, while the provision of environmental information increased it by 21 %. Furthermore, combined health and environmental information significantly increased the probability of non-purchasing behavior by 22.8 % and the risk perception of microplastics for human health by 5.8 %. These results emphasized the critical role of information in shaping consumer preferences and provided evidence for validating investment in research and development related to microplastic pollution mitigation measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Classified as marine debris, man made materials are polluting the world's oceans. Recently, glass reinforced plastic (GRP) has been shown to degrade and contaminate the coasts. In this pioneering study, fibreglass particles have been detected in the soft parts of oysters and mussels collected from natural populations, in front of an active boatyard. The presence of particulate glass, with concentrations up to 11,220 particles/kg ww in Ostrea edulis and 2740 particles/kg ww in Mytilus edulis, was confirmed by micro Raman spectroscopy. The results showed higher accumulation during the winter months, when boat maintenance activities are peaking and, through repair work, the release of glass fibres in the environment is more likely. Bivalves are considered high risk species due to their sessile nature and extensive filter feeding behaviour. The microparticle inclusion may contribute to adverse impacts on physiological processes and eventually to a decline in the overall health and subsequent death of the animal. The high costs involved in the proper GRP disposal and the lack of recycling facilities worldwide lead to boat abandonement and further contamination of the coasts. For the first time this study presents the extensive fibreglass contamination of natural bivalve populations, in a popular South England sailing harbour, designated a biological and geological site of specific scientific interest (SSRI). © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are distributed widely in the ocean surface waters and sediments. Increasing MPs contamination in intertidal zone profoundly impacts microbial ecosystem services and biogeochemical process. Little is known about the response of tidal sediment microbiome to MPs. We conducted a 30-day laboratory microcosm study using five polymers (PE, PBS, PC, PLA and PET) at three concentrations (1 %, 2 % and 5 %, w/w). High throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA, qPCR and enzyme activity test were applied to demonstrate the response of microbial community and nitrogen cycling functional genes to MPs. MPs reduced the microbial alpha diversity and the microbial dissimilarity while the effects of PLA-MPs were concentration dependent. LEfSe analysis indicated that the Proteobacteria predominated for all MP treatments. Mantel's test, RDA and correlation analysis implied that pH may be the key environmental factor for causing microbial alterations. MPs enhanced nitrogen fixation in tidal sediment. PLA levels of 1 % but not 5 % produced the most significant effects in nitrogen cycling functional microbiota and genes. PLS-PM revealed that impacts of MPs on tidal sediment microbial communities and nitrogen cycling were dominated by indirect effects. Our study deepened understanding and filled the knowledge gap of MP contaminants affecting tidal sediment microbial nitrogen cycling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " This research paper addresses the urgent environmental concern of microplastic (MP) emissions, focusing on the behavioral attitudes and perceptions of the general populace in Shyamnagar Upazila, Bangladesh. Against the backdrop of escalating MP pollution globally, this study investigates the level of awareness and the factors influencing public engagement in mitigating MP prevalence. Leveraging survey data from 350 respondents, the ordered logistic regression (OLR) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models are employed for comprehensive data analysis. The findings expose a concerning lack of awareness about MPs, as only 12% of respondents possessed prior knowledge, and a notable 63% remained uninformed about MP pollution. The OLR model reveals a positive correlation between heightened awareness of MPs and an increased willingness to take action. Gender differences become evident, with women exhibiting greater willingness than men to mitigate MP emissions, and environmental practitioners displaying heightened motivation. The BRT model underscores construction materials and industrial pollution as the primary influential factors amplifying MP pollution. These insights not only illuminate the existing scenario but also provide a basis for fostering favorable behavioral attitudes and perceptions to mitigate the prevalence of MPs within the coastal milieu. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Source-to-sink geoscientific domain and environmental plastic cycle studies are two major scientific worlds starting to interact, taking benefit from each other. To advance in our understanding of the sharing benefits between interconnecting research communities, we firstly carry out a review from sedimentology, sources, sinks, transport dynamic and pathways of microplastics along the entire source-to-sink (S2S) profile. The main peculiarities for microplastics are the numerous and distributed sources across the environment, as well as the importance of physical properties and shape factors. Then, we propose a review of plastic mass concentration along the S2S profile to discuss influence of sedimentation rate on microplastic accumulation and to identify intermediate reservoir and final fates. Deep sea deposits, including turbidite systems are potentially hotspots for microplastic accumulation that are poorly studied, deserving much more attention to scale mass balance studies. This review finally highlights areas of synergies between S2S geoscientific and plastic communities to guide future interdisciplinary microplastic research. Most of these issues will rely on multiplying measurements across all matrices and environments based on standard technology to generate homogenized measurements and large database for plastic and microplastics. © 2023,\n",
       " Plastic waste degrades slowly in aquatic environments, transforming into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), which are subsequently ingested by fish and other aquatic organisms, causing both physical blockages and chemical toxicity. The fish immune system serves as a crucial defense against viruses and pollutants present in water. It is imperative to comprehend the detrimental effects of MPs on the fish immune system and conduct further research on immunological assessments. In this paper, the immune response and immunotoxicity of MPs and its combination with environmental pollutants on fish were reviewed. MPs not only inflict physical harm on the natural defense barriers like fish gills and vital immune organs such as the liver and intestinal tract but also penetrate cells, disrupting intracellular signaling pathways, altering the levels of immune cytokines and gene expression, perturbing immune homeostasis, and ultimately compromising specific immunity. Initially, fish exposed to MPs recruit a significant number of macrophages and T cells while activating lysosomes. Over time, this exposure leads to apoptosis of immune cells, a decline in lysosomal degradation capacity, lysosomal activity, and complement levels. MPs possess a small specific surface area and can efficiently bind with heavy metals, organic pollutants, and viruses, enhancing immune responses. Hence, there is a need for comprehensive studies on the shape, size, additives released from MPs, along with their immunotoxic effects and mechanisms in conjunction with other pollutants and viruses. These studies aim to solidify existing knowledge and delineate future research directions concerning the immunotoxicity of MPs on fish, which has implications for human health. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in the form of microplastics (MPs), poses a significant threat to natural ecosystems, with detrimental ecological, social, and economic impacts. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the existing research on the interaction between microbial biofilms and MPs in natural environments. The review begins by outlining the sources and types of MPs, emphasizing their widespread presence in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. It then discusses the formation and characteristics of microbial biofilms on MPs surfaces, highlighting their role in altering the physicochemical properties of MPs and facilitating processes such as vertical transport, biodegradation, dispersion of microorganisms, and gene transfer. Different methods used to assess these interactions are discussed, including microbiological and physicochemical characterization. Current gaps and challenges in understanding the complex relationships between biofilms and MPs are identified, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these complex interactions and to develop effective mitigation strategies. Innovative solutions, including bioremediation techniques and their combination with other strategies, such as nanotechnology, advanced filtration technologies, and public awareness campaigns, are proposed as promising approaches to address the issue of MPs pollution. Overall, this review underscores the urgent need for a multidisciplinary approach to combating MPs pollution, combining scientific research, technological innovation, and public engagement to safeguard the health and integrity of natural ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have become pervasive in marine ecosystems, exerting detrimental effects on marine life. The concurrent presence and interaction of MPs and heavy metals in aquatic environments could engender more insidious toxicological impacts. This study aimed to elucidate the potential impacts and underlying mechanisms of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs), cadmium (Cd), and their combined stress (MPs-Cd) on sea cucumbers (Apostichopus japonicus). It focused on the growth, Cd bioaccumulation, oxidative stress responses, immunoenzymatic activities, and metabolic profiles, specifically considering PS-MPs sizes preferentially ingested by these organisms. The high-dose MPs (MH) treatment group exhibited an increase in cadmium bioavailability within the sea cucumbers. Exposure to PS-MPs or Cd triggered the activation of antioxidant defenses and immune responses. PS-MPs and Cd exhibited a synergistic effect on lysozyme (LZM) activity. A total of 149, 316, 211, 197, 215, 619, 434, and 602 differentially expressed metabolites were identified, distinguishing the low-dose MPs (ML), high-dose MPs (MH), low-dose Cd (LCd), low-dose MPs and low-dose Cd (MLLCd), high-dose MPs and low-dose Cd (MHLCd), high-dose Cd (HCd), low-dose MPs and high-dose Cd (MLHCd), high-dose MPs and high-dose Cd (MHHCd) groups, respectively. Metabolomic analyses revealed disruptions in lipid metabolism, nervous system function, signal transduction, and transport and catabolism pathways following exposure to PS-MPs, Cd, and MPs-Cd. Correlation analyses among key differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) underscored the interregulation among these metabolic pathways. These results offer new perspectives on the distinct and synergistic toxicological impacts of microplastics and cadmium on aquatic species, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental contaminants and their effects on marine life. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The occurrence and persistence of microplastics (MPs) in natural environments are of increasing concern. Along with this, the transport of MPs in sediments has been investigated mainly focusing on the effect of plastic size and shape, media size effect, and solution chemistry. Yet, the influence of particle density is only partially understood. Therefore, column experiments on the transport of variably buoyant MPs in saturated natural sediments and glass beads were conducted, and transport parameters were quantified using a two-site kinetic transport model with a depth-dependent blocking function (the amount of retained MPs does not decrease at a constant rate with increasing depth, the majority of MPs were retained near the column inlet). Neutral, sinking, and buoyant MPs within the same size range were selected, with stable water isotope applied as conservative tracer to explore water and MP movement in the tested sediments. The results showed that 95.5 ± 1.4% of sinking MPs remained in columns packed with gravel, followed by buoyant and neutral MPs, thus indicating that particle density does affect MP mobility. Similar recovered amounts of MPs were found in columns packed with glass beads, indicating that tested sediment types do not affect the deposition behavior of MPs. The breakthrough curves of MPs were accurately described by the selected model. However, the simulated retention profiles overestimated the observed MP amount in layers closest to the column inlet. The coupled experimental and modeled results suggest an enhanced retention of sinking MPs, while neutrally and buoyant MPs exhibit a higher mobility in comparison. Thus, neutral or buoyant MPs can potentially pose a higher contamination risk to subsurface porous media environments compared to sinking MPs. Discrepancies between observed and simulated retention profiles indicate that future model development is needed for advancing the MP deposition as affected by particle density. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Due to the lack of research on the co-effects of microplastics and trace metals in the environment on nitrogen cycling-related functional microorganisms, the occurrence of microplastics and one of their plasticisers, phthalate esters, as well as trace metals, were determined in soils and river sediments in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Relationship between microplastics and phthalate esters in the area was determined; the co-effects of these potentially toxic materials, and key factors and pathways affecting nitrogen functions were further explored. Significant correlations between fibre- and film-shaped microplastics and phthalate esters were detected in the soils from the plateau. Copper, lead, cadmium and di-n-octyl phthalate detected significantly affected nitrogen cycling-related functional microorganisms. The co-existence of di-n-octyl phthalate and copper in soils synergistically stimulated the expression of denitrification microorganisms nirS gene and “nitrate_reduction”. Additionally, di-n-octyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate more significantly affected the variation of nitrogen cycling-related functional genes than the number of microplastics. In a dimethyl phthalate- and cadmium-polluted area, nitrogen cycling-related functional genes, especially nirK gene, were more sensitive and stressed. Overall, phthalate esters originated from microplastics play a key role in nitrogen cycling-related functions than microplastics themselves, moreover, the synergy between di-n-octyl phthalate and copper strengthen the expression of denitrification functions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Humans produce 350 million metric tons of plastic waste per year, leading to microplastic pollution and widespread environmental contamination, particularly in aquatic environments. This subsequently impacts aquatic organisms in myriad ways, yet the vast majority of research is conducted in marine, rather than freshwater systems. In this study, we exposed eggs and hatchlings of the Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) to 80-nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) and monitored the impacts on development, behavior and the gut microbiome. We demonstrate that 80-nm PS-NPs can penetrate the eggshell and move into developing embryos. This led to metabolic impairments, as evidenced by bradycardia (a decreased heart rate), which persisted until hatching. We found no evidence that nanoplastic exposure affected hatchling morphology, growth rates, or levels of boldness and exploration, yet we discuss some potential caveats here. Exposure to nanoplastics reduced the diversity and homogeneity of gut microbiota in P. sinensis, with the level of disruption correlating to the length of environmental exposure (during incubation only or post-hatching also). Thirteen core genera (with an initial abundance >1 %) shifted after nanoplastic treatment: pathogenic bacteria increased, beneficial probiotic bacteria decreased, and there was an increase in the proportion of negative correlations between bacterial genera. These changes could have profound impacts on the viability of turtles throughout their lives. Our study highlights the toxicity of environmental NPs to the embryonic development and survival of freshwater turtles. We provide insights about population trends of P. sinensis in the wild, and future directions for research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Large masses of pelagic Sargassum occur in the Atlantic Ocean between the latitudes 5°S and 38°N. Since 2011, inundations have happened in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and West Africa, affecting biological communities and economies. A series of severe weather events in the Azores led to a Sargassum inundation between mid-December 2023 and early April 2024, here reported for the first time. Although the sea reclaimed most of the stranded algae, 555 metric tons were removed. Periodic inundations may represent an introduction pathway for non-native species since massive amounts of organisms are deposited alive on the coast. Besides the ecological impact, the inundations can be harmful to human health and impact the tourism sector. Further studies on the expected changes in the frequency and severity of storms in the region are necessary to evaluate the probability of new inundations. Measures to attenuate possible impacts should also be searched. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " We present the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics (MP) in surface waters and sediments between 2020 and 2022 in the Bay of Marseille. Microplastics were extracted with an improved, ecological protocol from 27 surface water and 16 sediment samples. The hydrodynamical circulation model MARS3D-RHOMA was used with in-situ data to test the influence of meteorological and hydrodynamic forcing on the concentration of MPs during the study period. The reported concentrations are analogous to abundances previously found in the Bay of Marseille, as well as in similar coastal systems. Average MP concentrations are 5.79 ± 12.71 MP.m−3 in surface water and 855 ± 413 MP.kg−1 dw in sediments. Simulations revealed hydrodynamic features associated with several episodes of Rhone intrusion in the Bay of Marseille. The observed MP concentrations and distribution in February 2020 suggest that the Rhone River's plume entered the Bay of Marseille. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic particles have emerged as a growing threat to both ecosystems and human well-being, as they are being ingested and accumulate at different trophic levels. However, microplastic and mesoplastic contamination and its risk to coastal and marine water fish have not been well studied, particularly in the northern Bay of Bengal. In this study, the presence of small-scale plastic particles (micro- and meso-sized) in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and muscles of six edible fish species from the northern Bay of Bengal Coast were identified and analyzed. The overall range of microplastics was 1.74 ± 0.23–3.79 ± 2.03items/g in muscle and 0.54 ± 0.22–5.96 ± 3.16 items/g in the GIT, with 16.38 ± 8.08–31.88 ± 12.09 items/individual. No mesoplastics were found in muscle tissue, but they were present in the GIT at concentrations ranging from 0.33 ± 0.27 to 0.03 ± 0.02 items/g and from 0.51 ± 0.05to 1.38 ± 1.01 items/individual. Lepturacanthus savala accumulated the most microplastics in muscle, and Harpadon nehereus had the least. In addition, the highest levels of mesoplastics were detected in the GIT of Polynemus paradiseus and the lowest was detected in the GIT of Lutjenus sanguineus. Omnivorous fish showed higher plastic concentrations than carnivorous fish, which was linked to dietary habits, feeding strategies and digestive processes. Plastic material predominantly accumulated in the GIT rather than in the muscle. The majority of ingested plastic particles were fibres (95.18 %), were violet in color (34 %), and were < 0.5 mm in size (87 %). The dominant microplastic polymers included 38 % PE, 15 % PP, 33 % PU, and 14 % CES. In contrast, the prevalent mesoplastic polymers comprised 45 % PE, 19 % PP, 13 % PS, 16 % PA, and 7 % PET. Subsequently, a hazard analysis using the polymer hazard index (PHI) revealed that plastic contamination was of distinct hazard categories for different polymer types, ranging from grade I (<1) to grade IV (100−1000). The assessment of the contamination factor (1 < CF < 3) and pollution load index (PLI > 1) indicated moderate contamination of fish by the ingestion of plastic debris. This study provides the foremost evidence for the presence of mesoplastics and microplastics in coastal and marine fish in the study region, paving the way for future investigations and policy implementation. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pose a clear threat to aquatic organisms affecting their health. Their impact on liver homeostasis, as well as on the potential onset of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is still poorly investigated and remains almost unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of subchronic exposure to polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs; 1–20 μm; 0, 25, or 250 mg/kg b.w./day) on lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative balance in the liver of gilthead seabreams (Sparus aurata Linnaeus, 1758) exposed for 21 days via contaminated food. PS-MPs induced an up-regulation of mRNA levels of crucial genes associated with lipid synthesis and storage (i.e., PPARy, Srebp1, Fasn) without modifications of genes involved in lipid catabolism (i.e., PPARα, HL, Pla2) or transport and metabolism (Fabp1) in the liver. The increase of CSF1R and pro-inflammatory cytokines gene expression (i.e., TNF-α and IL-1β) was also observed in exposed fish in a dose-dependent manner. These findings were confirmed by hepatic histological evaluations reporting evidence of lipid accumulation, inflammation, and necrosis. Moreover, PS-MPs caused the impairment of the hepatic antioxidant defense system through the alteration of its enzymatic (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (glutathione) components, resulting in the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as biomarkers of oxidative damage. The alteration of detoxifying enzymes was inferred by the decreased Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) at the highest PS-MP dose. The study suggests that PS-MPs affect the liver health of gilthead seabream. The liver dysfunction and damage caused by exposure to PS-MPs result from a detrimental interplay of inflammation, oxidative damage, and antioxidant and detoxifying enzymatic systems modifications, altering the gut-liver axis homeostasis. This scenario is suggestive of the involvement of MP-induced effects in the onset and progression of hepatic lipid dysfunction in gilthead seabream. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution has affected every region of the marine environment and every level of the food chain. The potential health risks associated with the consumption of seafood products affect the worldwide seafood industry. Crustaceans are the fastest-growing fisheries industry. However, due to their predatory feeding behavior and benthic habitats, crabs are at higher risk of consuming MPs than other marine organisms. This is especially true for blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) who spent most of their lives in coastal environments (such as lagoons and estuaries), which are among the most burdened environments by microplastic pollution. This study evaluated the occurrence of MPs within juvenile blue crabs from Antinioti lagoon, Greece. The findings showed an average abundance of 0.28 MPs/Ind with MPs being identified as nylon and polyethylene (PE), by Raman microscopy. Hence, blue crabs are affected by microplastic pollution from the early stages of their lives. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " During the past decades, microplastics (MPs) have become an emerging concern due to their persistence and potential environmental threat. MP pollution has become so drastic that it has been found in the human food chain, breast milk, polar regions, and even the Himalayan basin, lake, etc. Inflammation, pulmonary hypertension, vascular occlusions, increased coagulability and blood cell cytotoxicity, disruption of immune function, neurotoxicity, and neurodegenerative diseases can all be brought on by severe microplastic exposure. Although many MPs studies have been performed on single environmental compartments, MPs in multi-environmental compartments have yet to be explored fully. This review aims to summarize the muti-environmental media, detection tools, and global management scenarios of MPs. The study revealed that MPs could significantly alter C flow through the soil-plant system, the structure and metabolic status of the microbial community, soil pH value, biomass of plant shoots and roots, chlorophyll, leaf C and N contents, and root N contents. This review reveals that MPs may negatively affect many C-dependent soil functions. Different methods have been developed to detect the MPs from these various environmental sources, including microscopic observation, density separation, Raman, and FT-IR analysis. Several articles have focused on MPs in individual environmental sources with a developed evaluation technique. This review revealed the extensive impacts of MPs on soil-plant systems, microbial communities, and soil functions, especially on water, suggesting possible disturbances to vital ecological processes. Furthermore, the broad range of detection methods explored emphasizes the significance of reliable analytical techniques in precisely evaluating levels of MP contamination in various environmental media. This paper critically discusses MPs' sources, occurrences, and global management scenarios in all possible environmental media and ecological health impacts. Future research opportunities and required sustainable strategies have also been suggested from Bangladesh and international perspectives based on challenges faced due to MP's pollution. © 2023,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a profound problem around the world yet it’s study on the effect on zooplankton including copepods are very limited. The study was conducted between January 2021 and January 2022 in the Lower Meghna Estuary to investigate MPs ingestion in two different family of copepod: Calanoid and Cyclopoid. A method of acid digestion along with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to identify MPs ingested by copepods from the conducted area. However, three types of MPs namely fiber, fragment and foam were extracted from this copepod biomass. Fibers represent highest (> 50%) of the ingested MPs from both group of copepod that exceed fragments and foams in all sampling stations. The overall ingestion rate of Calanoid was found higher (0.084 ± 0.002 particles/individual) compared to the Cyclopoid group (0.077 ± 0.001 particles/individual). The results of the study have effectively illustrated that copepod, obtained from multiple sampling sites within the Lower Meghna Estuary, display a propensity to ingest MPs and subsequently endangering the food security of seafood industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " In this study, the behavior of metal cations and organic matter during polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNP) aggregation was explored combing experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulation. The results indicated that coexisting organic matter, including organic pollutants and humic acid (HA), play a complex role in determining PSNP aggregation. The representative organic pollutant, bisphenol A, exhibited competitive behavior with HA during heteroaggregation, and the heteroaggregation between HA and PSNP was impaired by bisphenol A. The bridging effect of metal ions in aggregation is related to their interaction strength with functional groups, binding affinity with water molecules, and concentration. In particular, Mg2+ interacts more strongly with oxygen-containing functional groups on PSNP than Ca2+. However, Mg2+ is more favorable for binding with water and is therefore not as effective as Ca2+ for destabilizing PSNP. Compared with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Na+ showed a weaker association with PSNP; however, it still showed a significant effect in determining the aggregation behavior of PSNP owing to its high concentration in seawater. Overall, we provided a molecular-level understanding of PSNP aggregation and deepened our understanding of the fate of nanoplastics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic pollution is widely found in deep-sea sediments. Despite being an international environmental issue, it remains unclear whether PET can be degraded through bioremediation in the deep sea. Pelagic sediments obtained from 19 sites across a wide geographic range in the Pacific Ocean were used to screen for bacteria with PET degrading potential. Bacterial consortia that could grow on PET as the sole carbon and energy source were found in 10 of the 19 sites. These bacterial consortia showed PET removal rate of 1.8%–16.2% within two months, which was further confirmed by the decrease of carbonyl and aliphatic hydrocarbon groups using attenuated total reflectance–Fourier-transform infrared analysis (ATR-FTIR). Analysis of microbial diversity revealed that Alcanivorax and Pseudomonas were predominant in all 10 PET degrading consortia. Meanwhile, Thalassospira, Nitratireductor, Nocardioides, Muricauda, and Owenweeksia were also found to possess PET degradation potential. Metabolomic analysis showed that Alcanivorax sp. A02-7 and Pseudomonas sp. A09-2 could turn PET into mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) even in situ stimulation (40 MPa, 10 °C) conditions. These findings widen the currently knowledge of deep-sea PET biodegrading process with bacteria isolates and degrading mechanisms, and indicating that the marine environment is a source of biotechnologically promising bacterial isolates and enzymes. © 2024,\n",
       " Seamounts can have strong influence on the dynamics and production of waters surrounding them, sometimes creating a kind of oasis effect. To assess to what depths and under what conditions this effect may persist on seamounts, we analysed the fauna and recent history of the Valencia Seamount (VS), a deep, small seamount (summit depth: 1056 m) from an oligotrophic zone of the Mediterranean Sea. The (living) epibenthic fauna of the VS summit (up to 1300 m) was composed of filter feeders, surface deposit feeders and carnivores (63 species), structured in a trophic chain as indicated by the high positive relationship (r2 0.502) between the δN15and δC13 of the fauna analysed. This trophic linearisation (compared with Catalan and NW Mallorca slope sites at similar depths) may optimise the energy flux reaching the seamount, with rather high %TOC (0.93–1.19%) and C/N (5.0–5.5) in July. The Valencia Seamount can also act as a reservoir zone for fish (grenadiers: Nezumia aequalis, and Hymenocephalus italicus) and shrimps (Plesionika martia), which are distributed at shallower depths on adjacent slopes, where they are exploited. The specimens caught were mainly juveniles, suggesting that these species may rather form pseudopopulations. Tuna and cetaceans were regularly sighted on the surface of VS during a specific period of the year (June–July). Reconstructing the recent history of Valencia Seamount (MC2 sediment core taken at 1151 m in 2021) we evidenced a decline of zooplankton pteropods (primary consumers) since ca. the 1960s (MC2 dating after 210Pb, metals and microplastic analyses), linked to a decline of Si in sediments suggesting a decrease in primary production due to a decrease in rainfall and river runoff. An increase of vorticity (ω+ values), i.e. of cyclonic gyres, and currents after the 1970s over the summit probably increased resuspension of organic matter, which in turn may enhance zooplankton aggegations at VS summit. We hypothesise that this would explain the parallel increase in mesopelagic myctophids in MC2 (from otolith records). Sediments of the Valencia seamount recorded several historical changes. Reconstruction studies carried out in oceanic areas can therefore help to understand the history and improve the management of fragile systems such as seamounts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The usage of plastics has increased reliably over the years. Worldwide plastic pollution has grown to 460 million tons annually, increasing global greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4 %. In recent years, several studies have been performed utilizing microorganisms for bioremediation. The aggregation of microplastics affects marine aquatic life, posing a severe threat to the aquatic environment and hurting the global food chain. Bioremediation of various polymers is cost-effective and environmentally feasible compared to chemical, physical, and biophysical methods. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are photosynthetic organisms and can generate value-added products from waste, i.e., waste valorization and minimization. The present study uses Cyanobacterial sp. (Anabaena & Nostoc) to degrade the synthetic polymers prepared in lab-scale conditions. Weight loss of the degraded polymers was examined, and polymeric characteristics were analyzed through SEM, FTIR, XRD, and AFM. The experimental study observed that the polymers degraded by about 70 % and 82 % by Nostoc and Anabaena sp. in about eight weeks (approx. Two months). Polymers are degraded into monomers such as vinyl alcohol, ethylene, terephthalic acid, polycaprolactone from polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl alcohol. They further break down into carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water. These are identified from the LCMS-MS analysis. The experimental data for the degradation of polymers in Cyanobacteria sp. and control media fitted the Sinclair and Peppas kinetic model well. The results inferred that those cyanobacteria could degrade the polymers very effectively since it is a potent bioremediatory agent that can remove different organic and inorganic contaminants from the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Amongst the increasing number of anthropogenic stress factors threatening ocean equilibrium, microplastics (MP; < 5 mm) have emerged as particularly worrisome. In situ observations have shown that MP accumulate in large areas at the surface ocean where it may threaten the functioning marine species. In particular, experimental evidence has shown that the grazing rates of several zooplankton species may be significantly altered by MP. These direct impacts on zooplankton may alter nutrient and carbon cycling. However, how these laboratory results may translate into impacts on the global ocean is yet unknown. Here, we use a global coupled physical-biogeochemical model including MP (NEMO/PISCES-PLASTIC) to investigate the impacts of MP exposure on zooplankton grazing rates. Drawing from experimental results, we use varying water contamination impact thresholds to explore the biogeochemical consequences of MP impacts on short (10 years) and long timescales (100 years). Our simulations show that the geographical extent of MP impacts on zooplankton remains restricted to about 10% of the global ocean surface, even after 100 years of constant MP contamination. However, in the most contaminated regions (e.g. the sub-tropical gyres), [MP] has surged from a few mg m−3 to > 50 mg m−3. Despite their oligotrophic nature and limited contribution to the overall ocean carbon cycle, MP impacts on zooplankton grazing could disrupt carbon cycling in these highly contaminated regions (up to 50% reduction in yearly primary production, carbon export fluxes and organic matter remineralisation after 100 years). Our research suggests that persistent MP pollution in the ocean could diminish primary production by 4%. In spite of the large sensitivity of our results to the water contamination impact threshold, we suggest MP impacts on zooplankton grazing may cause an annual loss of 1 Gt yr−1 of exported carbon after 100 years, if MP inputs remain constant globally. © 2024 The Author(s).

       " To mitigate ecological and health risks, implementing a comprehensive multidisciplinary monitoring strategy is imperative. This approach aims to effectively identify and record potential declines in water quality and ecological conditions. Utilizing cost-effective and efficient monitoring tools is crucial, especially for developing nations. Despite the previously reported uMlalazi River's pristine status within a protected natural reserve at South Africa's eastern coast, our findings challenge the assumption of its cleanliness, emphasizing the need for ongoing proactive monitoring. Here we reassess the pollution levels and ecological status of aquatic life of the river, and use this to enhance the indicator value of microfauna in South Africa. We analysed 25 surface sediment samples from the uMlalazi estuary, covering a salinity range from oligohaline to euhaline, with a focus on marginal marine Ostracoda and Foraminifera as potential indicators. All samples contained Ostracoda and Foraminifera, with the exception of two. Among the identified ostracod species, there were 17 species belonging to 14 genera. Typical taxa are the brackish water species Perissocytheridea estuaria, Sulcostocythere knysnaenis, and Australoloxoconcha favornamentata. We identified 19 Foraminifera species from 16 genera, with dominant taxa such as Ammonia sp., Quinqueloculina sp., and Miliolinella sp. Three distinct assemblages were observed: A) Ammonia sp. and Quinqueloculina sp., with very low diversity and abundances in general, located along the river course at stations exceeding Pollution Load Index (PLI), which indicates deterioration of sites quality; B) Ammonia sp., Quinqueloculina sp., and Sulcostocythere knysnaenis associated with higher salinity and lower PLI; C) Ammonia sp., Quinqueloculina agglutinans, and Cribroelphidium articulatum located in mudflats with minimal PLI. Our findings align with the commonly observed diversity trend, which indicates reduced species diversity corresponding to elevated pollution levels. Notably, the examined samples revealed a range of Foraminiferal Abnormality Index (FAI) up to 23%, exhibiting anomalies such as multiple tests, changes in coiling, and abnormal chamber shapes. Geochemical analysis indicates that the catchment is subjected to substantial anthropogenic pressure, as evidenced by elevated concentrations of heavy metals, sulphur, and microplastic. Sugarcane farming, urban sewage, titanium mining, and fish farming are the primary sources of pollution in the catchment area. Ongoing investigations in South African estuaries are expanding our dataset and will contribute to a better understanding of the species-specific responses of Ostracoda and Foraminifera to anthropogenic pressure. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution is an emerging environmental health concern, impacting soil, plants, animals, and humans through their entry into the food chain via bioaccumulation. Human activities such as improper solid waste dumping are significant sources that ultimately transport MPs into the water bodies of the coastal areas. Moreover, there is a complex interplay between the coastal climate dynamics, environmental factors, the burgeoning issue of MPs pollution and the complex web of coastal pollution. We embark on a comprehensive journey, synthesizing the latest research across multiple disciplines to provide a holistic understanding of how these inter-connected factors shape and reshape the coastal ecosystems. The comprehensive review also explores the impact of the current climatic patterns on coastal regions, the intricate pathways through which MPs can infiltrate marine environments, and the cascading effects of coastal pollution on ecosystems and human societies in terms of health and socio-economic impacts in coastal regions. The novelty of this review concludes the changes in climate patterns have crucial effects on coastal regions, proceeding MPs as more prevalent, deteriorating coastal ecosystems, and hastening the transfer of MPs. The continuous rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and strong storms result in habitat loss, decline in biodiversity, and economic repercussion. Feedback mechanisms intensify pollution effects, underlying the urgent demand for environmental conservation contribution. In addition, the complex interaction between human, industry, and biodiversity demanding cutting edge strategies, innovative approaches such as remote sensing with artificial intelligence for monitoring, biobased remediation techniques, global cooperation in governance, policies to lessen the negative socioeconomic and environmental effects of coastal pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " This study explores microplastic (MP) presence in the gastrointestinal tracts of deep-sea fish from the Central Indian Ocean, off the Indian coast. Among the 27 species examined, 19 showed MP contamination, averaging 2.68 ± 0.30 (±SE) MPs per individual. Polymer analysis via FTIR and micro-Raman identified several types, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polypropelene (PP), polyvinyl acetate (PVC), polyurethane (PU), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyaniline (PANI), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyethersulfone (PES), with PET being the most prevalent (33.33 %). MP ingestion was higher in benthopelagic fish and those at higher trophic levels, as indicated by comparisons across oceanic zones. Niche partitioning analysis suggests feeding behaviour as a primary influencer of MP ingestion in deep-sea fish rather than habitat or trophic level. The study proposes the potential use of deep-sea fish as indicators for assessing microplastic pollution across oceanic zones and deep-sea regions through bycatch monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) contamination has been identified as a worrisome environmental issue at the global level. Fish are the taxonomic group more extensively investigated to assess MP contamination in marine environment. A large variability in MP bioaccumulation (i.e., body burden) was reported in fish but to date there is a dearth of information concerning the drivers underlying this process. The present systematic review aimed at summarizing the results of the scientific literature on MP body burden in the digestive tract of marine fish to quantitatively shed light on the contribution of different geographical (i.e., latitudinal origin of the sample, distance from the coastline and field- or marked-collected) and ecological (i.e., trophic strategy, milieu, and body size) factors driving bioaccumulation. The mean (±SE) MPs/individual was 4.13 ± 2.87, and the mean MPs/ww (i.e., MPs/g) was 5.92 ± 0.94. Overall, MP abundance expressed as MPs/individual of fish from tropical areas was significantly higher compared to the other latitudinal bands, with species sampled close to the coastline that accumulated a larger number of MPs compared to those collected offshore. Neither the trophic strategy, nor the milieu and the market or field origin of fish explained the MP body burden. However, fish body size resulted as a determinant of MP body burden (as MPs/individual), with small fish accumulating a lower amount of MPs compared to larger ones. Qualitatively, but not statistically significant, similar results were generally obtained for MPs/ww, except for an opposite, and significant, variation according to species body size. Our findings showed that geographical, rather than ecological factors represent the main drivers of MP body burden in marine fish, suggesting that environmental variables and/or local pollution sources mainly contribute to explaining the large variability underlying the ingestion and bioaccumulation processes of these contaminants. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Despite numerous studies assessing the effects of microplastics (MPs) on soils and plants and their potential implications for human consumption and agriculture, there remains a lack of exploration on the role of vegetated ecosystems as natural filters of MPs pollution. The MPs stemming from anthropogenic continental activities may undergo retention within these ecosystems, preventing their dispersion into aquatic environments. However, questions are raised about their potential impact on plant health and soil quality. This review aims to address these gaps by examining studies analyzing the role of vegetated ecosystems in MPs retention, the sources and effects of these contaminants on soils, and their absorption/translocation into plants analyzing their direct effects on plant physiology and growth. Finally, future perspectives and knowledge gaps in these crucial research areas were explored. The main findings demonstrate that plants effectively play a crucial role in retaining MPs, with studies mainly focused on vegetated wetlands with halophytes, and that MPs could affect various soil properties, including bulk density, water retention, and microbiota, inducing oxidative stress on plants and disturbing their growth. However, research gaps persist, such as quantifying MPs in natural settings and investigating the complex relationship between MPs, plants, and ecosystems. Experiments often employed high concentrations of MPs, potentially deviating from natural environmental levels and thus requiring assessment of whether observed concentrations can elicit comparable effects. Additionally, the predominant focus on primary MPs in experiments overlooked other types derived from degradation of larger plastic items, warranting attention and inclusion in research efforts. In conclusion, vegetated ecosystems can naturally filter MPs from land-based activities before they reach aquatic environments. Nevertheless, these particles exhibit significant impacts on soil properties and plant growth, posing an emerging threat to terrestrial ecosystems that requires further study. © 2024,\n",
       " Chemical and microlitter (ML) pollution in three Estonian coastal areas (Baltic Sea) was investigated using mussels (Mytilus trossulus). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in mussel tissues were observed in moderate levels with high bioaccumulation factors for the more hydrophilic and low molecular weight PAH (LMW PAH), namely anthracene and fluorene. Tissue concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and cadmium within mussel populations exceeded the Good Environmental Status thresholds by more than 200% and 60%, respectively. Multiple contamination at the Muuga Harbour site by tributyltin, high molecular weight PAH, including the highly toxic benzo[c]fluorene and PBDE, coincided with the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and a lower condition index of the mussels. The metabolization and removal of bioaccumulated LMW PAH, reflected in the dominance of oxy-PAH such as anthracene-9,10-dione, is likely associated with the increased activity of glutathione S-transferase in caged mussels. Only a few microplastic particles were observed among the ML in mussel tissues, with coloured cellulose-based microfibers being the most prevalent. The average concentration of ML in mussels was significantly higher at the harbour area than at other sites. The integrated biomarker response index values allowed for the differentiation of pollution levels across studied locations representing high, intermediate, and low pollution levels within the studied area. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",

       " Microplastics pose a threat to marine environments through their physical presence and as vectors of chemical pollutants. However, the impact of microplastics on the accumulation and human health risk of chemical pollutants in marine organisms remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the microplastics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution in marine organisms from Sanggou Bay and analyzed their correlations. Results showed that microplastic and PAHs concentration ranged from 1.23 ± 0.23 to 5.77 ± 1.10 items/g, from 6.98 ± 0.45 to 15.07 ± 1.25 μg/kg, respectively. The microplastic abundance, particularly of fibers, transparent and color plastic debris, correlates strongly with PAH contents, indicating that microplastics increase the bioaccumulation of PAHs and microplastics with these characteristics have a significant vector effect on PAHs. Although consuming seafood from Sanggou Bay induce no carcinogenic risk from PAHs, the presence of microplastics in organisms can significantly increases incremental lifetime cancer risk of PAHs. Thus, microplastics can serve as transport vectors for PAHs with implications for the potential health risks to human through consumption. This study provides new insight into the risks of microplastics in marine environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The escalating production of Microplastics in marine environments has become a critical environmental issue. This in-depth study examines the worrying issue of microplastic pollution in aquatic environments, revealing notable gaps in the literature and presenting significant research opportunities. Microplastics, derived from the degradation of plastic waste, represent a major challenge for aquatic ecosystems due to their ease of ingestion by wildlife, with common polymers as the main sources. Major pathways of introduction include urban wastewater discharges and the mass disposal of plastic waste. Bioaccumulation, effects on marine ecosystems and identification techniques are areas requiring further exploration. At the same time, the increasing production of microplastics in marine environments is a critical environmental issue. Bibliometric analysis reveals key themes, including sources, production pathways, ecological impacts, and mitigation strategies. This research not only highlights current concerns, but also identifies emerging topics such as advanced monitoring technologies and sustainable production alternatives. Together, these findings offer crucial insights to guide future investigations aimed at mitigating the growing challenges associated with microplastic production in marine ecosystems.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.,\n",
       " Research on riverine microplastics has gradually increased, highlighting an area for further exploration: the lack of extensive, large-scale regional variations analysis due to methodological and spatiotemporal limitations. Herein, we constructed and applied a comprehensive framework for synthesizing and analyzing literature data on riverine microplastics to enable comparative research on the regional variations on a large scale. Research results showed that in 76 rivers primarily located in Asia, Europe, and North America, the microplastic abundance of surface water in Asian rivers was three times higher than that in Euro-America rivers, while sediment in Euro-American rivers was five times more microplastics than Asia rivers, indicating significant regional variations (p < 0.001). Additionally, based on the income levels of countries, rivers in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries had significantly (p < 0.001) higher abundance of microplastics in surface water compared to high-income countries, while the opposite was true for sediment. This phenomenon was preliminarily attributed to varying levels of urbanization across countries. Our proposed framework for synthesizing and analyzing microplastic literature data provides a holistic understanding of microplastic disparities in the environment, and can facilitate broader discussions on management and mitigation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The contamination of marine and freshwater environments by nanoplastics is considered a global threat for aquatic biota. Taking into account the most recent concentration range estimates reported globally and recognizing a knowledge gap in polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) ecotoxicology, the present work investigated the harmful effects of 20 nm and 80 nm PS-NPs, at increasing biological complexity, on the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss RTG-2 and gilthead seabream Sparus aurata SAF-1 cell lines. Twenty nm PS-NPs exerted a greater cytotoxicity than 80 nm ones and SAF-1 were approximately 4-fold more vulnerable to PS-NPs than RTG-2. The engagement of PS-NPs with plasma membranes was accompanied by discernible uptake patterns and morphological alterations along with a nuclear translocation already within a 30-min exposure. Cells were structurally damaged only by the 20 nm PS-NPs in a time-dependent manner as indicated by distinctive features of the execution phase of the apoptotic cell death mechanism such as cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane and DNA fragmentation. At last, functional analyses unveiled marked transcriptional impairment at both sublethal and lethal doses of 20 nm PS-NPs, with the latter impacting the “Steroid biosynthesis”, “TGF-beta signaling pathway”, “ECM-receptor interaction”, “Focal adhesion”, “Regulation of actin cytoskeleton” and “Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” pathways. Overall, a distinct ecotoxicological hazard of PS-NPs at environmentally relevant concentrations was thoroughly characterized on two piscine cell lines. The effects were demonstrated to depend on size, exposure time and model, emphasizing the need for a comparative evaluation of endpoints between freshwater and marine ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study investigates the presence of microplastics (MPs) in seawater, sediments, and organisms along the coastal areas of Da Nang, Vietnam. The results obtained revealed MP concentrations ranging from 111 to 304 MPs/L in seawater and 2267 to 4600 MPs/kg in sediment. In organisms such as oysters, mussels, crabs, snails, and fish, MP levels ranged from 1.8 to 17.3 MPs/g (wet weight). Fiber MPs were found to be predominant across seawater, sediment, and organisms. The study identified eight, ten, and eleven types of MPs in seawater, sediment, and organisms, respectively, with Nylon, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and Ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) being the most prevalent. Notably, MP concentrations were significantly higher in benthic organisms such as oysters, mussels, and crabs compared to fish (t-test, p < 0.05), suggesting habitat dependency. Similar concentrations, shapes, and types of MPs in seawater, sediments, and organisms demonstrate a tendency for MP accumulation in aquatic organisms within the marine environment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The pollution of deep-sea microplastics has received increasing attention. As a special ecosystem in the deep sea, the cold seep area is of great significance for studying the distribution of microplastics in the deep sea. In this work, the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in seawater, sediments, and shellfish in the Haima cold seep area and the correlation between the characteristics of microplastics in different media and the type of media were studied. Microplastics were found in all three media. The abundance of microplastics in different samples from the Haima cold seep area ranged 1.8–3.8 items/L for the seawater, 11.47–96.8 items/kg (d.w.) for the surface sediments, and 0–5 items/individual (0–0.714 items/g) for the shellfish. The amount of microplastics ingested by shellfish varied among different species. The microplastics in these three media were mainly fibrous, dark-colored, small-sized rayon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyethylene (PE). In the correlation analysis of microplastic characteristics among the three media, it was found that the characteristics of microplastics in different media in the same area were closely related, and each pair of variables showed a significant positive correlation (P ≤ 0.05). The distinctive geographical conditions would accelerate the interchange of microplastics among various media. Principal component analysis showed that habitat contribute to microplastic feature differences in shellfish. Differences in correlation were observed between the characteristics of shellfish microplastics in different regions and the characteristics of microplastics in surrounding seawater and sediments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The prevalence of microplastic (MP) contamination has become a significant environmental concern due to its pervasive nature and persistent effects. While sediments are considered major repositories for MPs, information on their spatial distribution within these matrices is insufficient. This research examined both the horizontal and vertical presence of MPs in the sediments surrounding Lake Paldang in South Korea, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the samples obtained. The total content of MPs varied from 2.15 to 122.2 particles g−1. The average contents of MPs on surface sediments were 40.47, 34.14, 5.01, and 8.19 particles g−1 in north mainstream (NM), south mainstream (SM), tributary (TB), and Tributary catchment (TC) based on Sonae Island, Gyeongan stream, respectively. The most abundant MP types were polyethylene (PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polypropylene (PP), accounting for more than 70% of the total MPs. The most abundant sizes of MPs were within 45–100 µm. At all sediment depths, polymers were distributed in the order PE, PP, and polyester in NM, SM, and TC, respectively, whereas PTFE mainly occurred in the surface layer. MPs distribution also exhibited seasonal variation as larger inflows and flow rates varied with season. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " A custom-designed, manufacturing process consisting of twin screw blending and spunbond spinning was optimized to achieve 100 nm nanofiber size in nanofibrillated spunbond composite products. Polypropylene (PP) as the matrix and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used as model common thermoplastics to investigate the formation of a nanofibril PET network throughout the PP matrix. The blends were twin-screw compounded, extruded through a spunbonding spinneret, and drawn through a drafter by intensive air flow. The resulting spun microfibers, with sea-island internal morphology were collected on a conveyor belt located underneath the drafter. A variety of samples were collected by changing the blending, spinning and drawing protocols. The inner fibers showed good levels of drawing at high drawing airspeeds of 15.9 m·s−1. Increasing the melt spinning temperature to 270 °C decreased the resistance of PET inner fibers to drawing, resulting in their improved attenuation. Accordingly, nanofibrillated spunbond composite containing PET inner fibers with an average diameter of as low as 84 nm were produced. Significantly improved crystallization kinetics in PP microfibers was obtained due to the nucleating effect of PET nanofibrils with a large interfacial area. Rheological investigations proved a dramatic enhancement in the storage modulus above those of the neat PP and its spherical blends with PET. Moreover, both tensile modulus and tensile strength were also enhanced by 65 % and 27 %, respectively. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics are persistent pollutants discovered and extensively researched in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems but have yet to receive attention in an atmospheric context. Although recent reports stated the presence of microplastics in the air, their global existence and distribution are not critically discussed to date. This review aimed to investigate the current status of research on atmospheric microplastics through bibliometric analysis and by comparing and summarising published research on global distribution. The review also provides a summary of methods that have been used to collect samples, identify microplastics, quantify their occurrence, and determine their transport mechanisms. The bibliometric analysis revealed that atmospheric microplastic studies predominantly originated in China. Clothing, vehicle, and tire materials were the major primary sources while house furniture, construction materials, landfills, urban dust, plastic recycling processes, and agricultural sludge were precursor secondary sources. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate microfibres have most frequently found in indoor and outdoor atmospheres. Level of urbanization and temporal or spatial distributions governs the fate of airborne microplastics, however, the knowledge gap in the retention and circulation of microplastics through the atmosphere is still large. Many challenges and limitations were identified in the methods used, presentation of data, aerodynamic processes facilitating atmospheric transport, and scarcity of research in spatially and temporally diverse contexts. The review concluded that there was a greater need for globalization of research, methods and data standardization, and emphasizes the potential for future research with atmospheric transportation modelling and thermochemical analysis. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in freshwater sediments, raising concern about their potential impacts on ecosystem services. However, the specific impacts of microbiota mediated by MPs in sediment and plastisphere compartments on P availability remain elusive. This investigation conducted a series of microcosm experiments utilizing eutrophic lake sediment amended with fuel-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET), bio-based polylactic acid (PLA) MPs, and a natural cobblestone substrate to unravel their effects. The findings highlighted that MPs induced alterations in bacterial communities in both sediment and plastisphere, consequently modifying P availabilities at the sediment-water interface (SWI). In comparison to non-biodegradable PET, biodegradable PLA MPs presented higher proportions of specific bacteria and functional genes associated with P profiles, such as Firmicutes, Ignavibacteriota, and P mineralizing genes in the sediment and plastisphere. This, in turn, elevated the levels of soluble reactive P in the porewater by 54.19 % (0–1 cm), 55.81 % (1–3 cm), and 18.24 % (3–5 cm), respectively. Additionally, PLA obviously altered P immobilization capacity and bioavailability, increasing the organic P fraction. Whereas, inert cobblestone exhibited negligible influence on P biogeochemical processes during the incubation. Moreover, the biofilm communities and those in the surrounding sediment specifically contributed to the changes in P profiles at the SWI. The functional genes associated with P profiles in the sediment mainly concentrate on P mineralization and P uptake/transport. In the plastisphere, P activation genes are obviously affected under MP exposure. This study fills the knowledge gap concerning the repercussions of MPs on ecosystem services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " We exposed adult individuals of the sentinel mangrove crab Minuca rapax to waterborne microplastics (MP; 53–63 μm polyethylene spheres) in a long-term experiment (56 days). Weassessed 1) MP effects on growth, survival, and food intake. and 2) the MP tissue acumulation and its reduction of body burden through feces and molting. MP exposure did not affect growth and survival. The hepatopancreas accumulated more MP than the gills and muscle. Most of the ingested MP particles were released in the feces and molts, indicating a rapid passage through the digestive tract. MP impaired food intake of M. rapax, with unknown consequences to the local populations. These results provide insights on MP translocation mechanisms, its elimination and toxicity associated with MP. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastic records from lake cores can reconstruct the plastic pollution history. However, the associations between anthropogenic activities and microplastic accumulation are not well understood. Huguangyan Maar Lake (HML) is a deep-enclosed lake without inlets and outlets, where the sedimentary environment is ideal for preserving a stable and historical microplastic record. Microplastic (size: 10-500 μm) characteristics in the HML core were identified using the Laser Direct Infrared Imaging system. The earliest detectable microplastics appeared unit in 1955 (1.1 items g-1). The microplastic abundance ranged from n.d. to 615.2 items g-1 in 1955-2019 with an average of 134.9 items g-1. The abundance declined slightly during the 1970s and then increased rapidly after China’s Reform and Opening Up in 1978. Sixteen polymer types were detectable, with polyethylene and polypropylene dominating, accounting for 23.5 and 23.3% of the total abundance, and the size at 10-100 μm accounted for 80%. Socioeconomic factors dominated the microplastic accumulation based on the random forest modeling, and the contributions of GDP per capita, plastic-related industry yield, and total crop yield were, respectively, 13.9, 35.1, and 9.3% between 1955-2019. The total crop yield contribution further increased by 1.7% after 1978. Coarse sediment particles increased with soil erosion exacerbated microplastics discharging into the sediment. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are greatly released into soils in different ways, specifically through mulching practices in irrigated loess soils in northern Iran as the fertile and susceptible soils to water erosion. This study was conducted to examine the effects of Polyethylene (PE) (a common kind of MPs used in mulching farming in loess soils of north Iran), in a Loess soil under an experimental study. A loess soil was collected from 0- 30 cm surface and incubated at two levels of PE (2.5 and 5 % by weight) in two sizes (1-2 mm and >2mm) for 60 days, at 70% of field capacity moisture and temperature of 25-28 ° C. Soils samples were collected in 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after incubation and different soil chemical, physical, mechanical and biological properties were measured. The results showed that soil pH was significantly (P<0.05) reduced by timing (time after incubation), and application rate of MPs. Inclusion of MPs led to increasing bulk density significantly (P<0.05) and also led to reducing aggregation and mean weight diameter (MWD) compared to control soil. The rate of MWD decreasing varied from 79 % to 87 % in different rates of MPs application. Among the mechanical attributes, liquid limit, plastic limit, and plastic index, all were reduced significantly (P<0.05) after mixing up and incubation with MPs. Reducing aggregation and aeration in treated soils compared to control soils, led to lowering soil microbial respiration, especially with timing. As our results about the effects of MPs in loess soils in a few cases were contrary to other soils studied worldwide, further studies are recommended to perform in loess soils in northern Iran, where receive considerable MPs by farming and open landfill practices in the studied region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in coastal areas, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, remains a pervasive environmental issue. Marine plastic debris provides an artificial surface that rapidly accumulates a dynamic microbial biofilm upon entering the marine ecosystem. Especially the early stages of colonization are critical in shaping the microbial community. This study investigates the early microbial colonization, in less than a week, on five different plastic polymers in Caribbean coastal waters through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We discovered shared bacterial taxa among the various plastic polymers and sampling timepoints, with dominant orders being Flavobacteriales, Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales, and Pseudomonadales. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in community composition between the two sampling points, with polystyrene exhibiting a distinct microbial community on day 6 compared to polyethylene, polypropylene, and nylon. We found the same for polyethylene compared to nylon and polyethylene-terephthalate. Further examination identified 47 genera responsible for these differences, primarily belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota. Our data indicate an influence of both environmentally related stochastic processes and plastic-related specific factors during early colonization. Interestingly, we noticed an increase in the relative abundance of hydrocarbon and potentially plastic-degrading bacteria (PDB) from 12.4 to 34.5 % between the first and sixth day, suggesting their vital role in shaping the epiplastic community. Notably, some identified PDB have been reported to degrade the specific polymers studied, thus the monitored increase in relative abundance supports their role in plastic degradation. However, more research is required to fully understand their functioning and potential role in the epiplastic community. Our study provides insights into the prokaryotic colonization of marine plastics in the Caribbean basin, where to date studies have been limited despite high pollution rates. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics in freshwater ecosystems have gained attention for their potential impact on biodiversity. Rivers are complex and dynamic ecosystems that transport particles and organic matter from the headwaters through watersheds to the ocean. Changes in land use and the presence of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) increase the risk of plastic contamination. Simultaneously, hydromorphological features of the watershed can influence the dispersion and retention of microplastics. This study assesses the impact of urban land uses and river hydromorphology on microplastic abundance and spatial distribution in two watersheds with contrasting land uses. Unexpectedly, our findings show that microplastics were widespread throughout watersheds both in water (3.5 ± 3.3 particles/L) and sediments (56.9 ± 39.9 particles/g). The concentration of microplastics in sediments significantly increased in granulometry ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. Microplastics in running waters are significantly correlated with increasing urban land use coverage. However, the presence and distance of WWTPs did not affect microplastic distribution. In conclusion, contrasting patterns were observed for suspended and sedimented microplastic particles: suspended microplastics were associated with an anthropogenic effect, whereas the concentration of microplastics in sediments was determined by riverbed granulometry. Our results suggest that the interaction of anthropogenic and environmental factors shapes microplastic distribution along the rivers and their subsequent transport toward the coastal ocean. Finally, a review of the current literature reveals the absence of standardization in field and laboratory assessment techniques and measurement units, representing a challenge for intercomparisons of river microplastic studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution constitutes a nuisance to the environment. It negatively affects marine life and pollutes soil and groundwater which can lead to serious health impacts. The aim of this paper is to look at recent advances and prospect of utilizing waste plastic char derived by pyrolysis of waste plastic as adsorbent for removing pollutants from landfill leachates. The impacts of waste plastics on aquatic life, tourism, human health, climate, and soil were reviewed and various strategies for waste plastic management were considered. Different classifications of pyrolysis which include thermal, catalytic and microwave – assisted pyrolysis processes with various heating rates: slow/conventional, fast, and flash pyrolysis were reviewed. Previous works carried out by researchers on synthesis of waste plastic char as adsorbent were critically examined. Furthermore, the prospect of using adsorbent synthesized via pyrolysis of waste plastic for removal of pollutants in landfill leachates was investigated. Recommendations on how to derive optimum benefits from the prospect of utilizing adsorbent derived through pyrolysis of waste plastic for removal of pollutants from landfill leachates are presented. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Cigarette butts (CBs) and Microplastics (MPs) have serious harmful effects on the environment and living organisms despite their small size. This research aims to investigate the abundance and pollution status of CBs and MPs in Tahtalı Dam Basin (West Anatolia, Türkiye) which is the most important drinking and irrigation water resources. Clean Environment Index (CEI) and Cigarette Butt Pollution Index (CBPI) were used to determine pollution degree of the basin. The total number of CBs were 1.478 items, the total number of MPs were 477 items/m2 in the basin. As a result of this study, MP particles weren’t found in Balaban Stream. Highest number of MP particles observed in 100–250 μm (45%) size class. The most abundant MP type and colour were, fragment (54%) and white (42%), respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (50%) was the most abundant type of polymer according to the ATR- FTIR analysis. As a result of the CEI and CBPI, the upstream stations of the stream were classified as “clean” status, while downstream sampling points of the stream and Balaban Lake coasts were classified as “extremely dirty” status. The calculated volumes of MP particulates from mining facility, agricultural and recreational activities indicate that anthropogenic factors are the most important MP source in the Tahtalı Dam Basin.

       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution and seawater acidification have increasingly become huge threats to the ocean ecosystem. Their impacts on microalgae are of great importance, since microalgae are the main primary producers and play a critical role in marine ecosystems. However, the impact of microplastics and acidification on unicellular red algae, which have a unique phycobiliprotein antenna system, remains unclear. Therefore, the impacts of polystyrene-MPs alone and the combined effects of MPs and seawater acidification on the typical unicellular marine red algae Porphyridium purpureum were investigated in the current study. The result showed that, under normal seawater condition, microalgae densities were increased by 17.75–41.67 % compared to the control when microalgae were exposed to small-sized MPs (0.1 μm) at concentrations of 5–100 mg L−1. In addition, the photosystem II and antioxidant enzyme system were not subjected to negative effects. The large-sized MPs (1 μm) boosted microalgae growth at a low concentration of MPs (5 mg L−1). However, it was observed that microalgae growth was significantly inhibited when MPs concentration increased up to 50 and 100 mg L−1, accompanied by the remarkably reduced Fv/Fm value and the elevated levels of SOD, CAT enzymes, phycoerythrin (PE), and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS). Compared to the normal seawater condition, microalgae densities were enhanced by 52.11–332.56 % under seawater acidification, depending on MPs sizes and concentrations, due to the formed CO2-enrichment condition and appropriate pH range. PE content in microalgal cells was significantly enhanced, but SOD and CAT activities as well as EPS content markedly decreased under acidification conditions. Overall, the impacts of seawater acidification were more pronounced than MPs impacts on microalgae growth and physiological responses. These findings will contribute to a substantial understanding of the effects of MPs on marine unicellular red microalgae, especially in future seawater acidification scenarios. © 2024,\n",
       " The expansion of offshore mussel aquaculture is intertwined with the rising demand for mussel grow-out ropes. Currently, these ropes are manufactured using fossil-fuel based or fossil-based plastics. In response to concerns about plastic pollution and sustainable aquaculture practices, biobased materials have emerged as more sustainable alternatives. Yet, the importance of the choice of raw materials, as well as the methods used in their production and sourcing, is key in determining the performance of materials in sea conditions within the context of aquaculture. This study evaluated the functionality of biobased ropes in terms of productivity and durability, comparing them to fossil-based counterparts during a one-year mussel culture in offshore conditions. Across one-year culture, noteworthy mussel losses were observed in the fossil-based (65%) ropes compared to the biobased B1 (53%) and B2 (18%) prototype ropes, B2 and B1 ropes yielding 85% and 23% more mussel (kg/ m rope) than the fossil-based ropes. Moreover, the higher correlations of shell length and body weight over time suggesting that biobased ropes may be more suitable substrates for mussel growth compared to fossil-based ropes. The structural distinction between the round and more uniform fine multifilaments in biobased ropes, as opposed to the clustered structure of flat fibres in fossil-based ropes, may have contributed to a more effective surface area for the initial attachment and growth of seeded mussels, avoiding subsequent losses. The use of biobased ropes contributed positively to the interplay between substrate structure, biofouling, and mussel attachment, which may be used for guiding further designs of aquaculture biobased gears. Despite seasonal variations, the final condition, proximate and fatty acid composition of mussel indicated their marketability and high nutritional quality. Higher shell length and mussel yields observed, indicating a potential for mussels cultivated on biobased ropes, especially in B2, to reach a higher market value. Regarding durability, linear density of biobased ropes remained unaltered after one-year offshore mussel culture. The biobased B2 rope prototype showed the highest ratio between the retention of mechanical properties (Load at Break and elongation) and the total mussel weight held for one year. The findings of this study validate the biobased B2 prototype as the most promising alternative to fossil-based ropes. It significantly boosted production yields of high-quality mussels while maintaining rope durability throughout one year in offshore culture. These results hold promise for reducing the reliance on fossil-based plastic ropes in mussel aquaculture, thereby contributing to decarbonization efforts. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In the recent monitoring guidelines released by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program's Litter and Microplastic Expert Group, Arctic salmonids were recommended as an important species for monitoring plastics in Arctic ecosystems, with an emphasis on aligning microplastic sampling and analysis methods in Arctic fishes. This recommendation was based on the minimal documentation of microplastics in Northern fishes, especially Arctic salmonids. In response, we worked collaboratively with local partners to quantify and characterize microplastics in Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, and their habitats in a commercial fishery near Iqaluktuuttiaq (Cambridge Bay), Nunavut. We sampled Arctic char, surface water, and benthic sediments within their summer foraging habitat at Palik (Byron Bay). We found microplastics in 95 % of char with an average of 26 (SD ± 19) particles per individual. On average, surface water samples had 23 (SD ± 12) particles/L and benthic sediment <1 particles/gww. This is the first documentation of plastic pollution in Arctic char and their coastal habitats. Future work should evaluate seasonal, temporal and spatial trends for long-term monitoring of microplastics in Arctic fishes and their habitats. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are a major concern in marine ecosystem because MPs are persistent and ubiquitous in oceans and are easily consumed by marine biota. Although many studies have reported the toxicity of MPs to marine biota, the toxicity of environmentally relevant types of MPs is little understood. We investigated the toxic effects of fragmented polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MP, one of the most abundant MPs in the ocean, on the marine rotifer Brachionus koreanus at the individual and molecular level. No significant rotifer mortality was observed after exposure to PET MPs for 24 and 48 h. The ingestion and egestion assays showed that rotifers readily ingested PET MPs in the absence of food but not when food was supplied; thus, there were also no chronic effects of PET MPs. In contrast, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and glutathione S-transferase activity in rotifers were significantly increased by PET MPs. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that genes and metabolites related to energy metabolism and immune processes were significantly affected by PET MPs in a concentration-dependent manner. Although acute toxicity of PET MPs was not observed, PET MPs are potentially toxic to the antioxidant system, immune system, and energy metabolism in rotifers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Evidence of microplastics has been found in a variety of marine ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems, animal species, and sometimes even humans. There is a growing consensus that plastics and microplastics pose a threat to human health and food safety, both in terms of the environment and the food chain. Yet, there is currently no technically viable option for addressing the problem of microplastics in the environment. Understanding people's preferences is therefore critical for minimizing plastics and microplastics contamination. This study employed the ordered logistic regression model to examine the people's readiness to restrict microplastic pollutions and its influencing elements, as well as their attitudes, perceptions and behaviors concerning plastics and microplastics. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at random, resulting in a total of 465 acceptable questionnaires. The findings expose a concerning lack of awareness about microplastics, as only 22% of respondents possessed prior knowledge, and a notable 66% remained uninformed about microplastics pollution. The desire to minimize microplastics emission was substantially influenced by a variety of factors, including family size, occupation, gender, familiarity with plastics and microplastics related to the health concerns and the environment. Gender differences become evident, with women exhibiting greater willingness than men to mitigate microplastics emission, and environmental practitioners displaying heightened motivation. Familiarity with plastics and microplastics particles enhanced the possibility that respondents would take action to reduce microplastics pollution. The study concludes by offering a number of policy reforms and legislative changes that would limit microplastics contamination during the plastic production and recycling processes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The health risks associated with combined exposure to microplastics (MPs) and cyanobacteria toxins have gained increasing attention due to the large-scale prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms and accumulation of MPs in aquatic environments. Therefore, we explored the cardiovascular toxic effects of microcystin-LR (MC-LR, 1, 10, 100 μg/L) in the presence of 5 μm polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs, 100 μg/L) and 80 nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, 100 μg/L) in zebrafish models. Embryos were exposed to certain PS-MPs and PS-NPs conditions in water between 3 h post-fertilization (hpf) and 168 hpf. Compared to MC-LR alone, a significant decrease in heart rate was observed as well as notable pericardial edema in the MC-LR + PS-MPs/NPs groups. At the same time, sinus venosus and bulbus arteriosus (SV-BA) distances were significantly increased. Furthermore, the addition of PS-MPs/NPs caused thrombosis in the caudal vein and more severe vascular damage in zebrafish larvae compared to MC-LR alone. Our findings revealed that combined exposure to PS-NPs and MC-LR could significantly decreased the expression of genes associated with cardiovascular development (myh6, nkx2.5, tnnt2a, and vegfaa), ATPase (atp1a3b, atp1b2b, atp2a1l, atp2b1a, and atp2b4), and the calcium channel (cacna1ab and ryr2a) compared to exposure to MC-LR alone. In addition, co-exposure with PS-MPs/NPs exacerbated the MC-LR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as the ROS-stimulated apoptosis and heightened inflammation. We also discovered that astaxanthin (ASTA) treatment partially attenuated these cardiovascular toxic effects. Our findings confirm that exposure to MC-LR and PS-MPs/NPs affects cardiovascular development through calcium signaling interference and ROS-induced cardiovascular cell apoptosis. This study highlights the potential environmental risks of the co-existence of MC-LR and PS-MPs/NPs for fetal health, particularly cardiovascular development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in the marine realm is a severe environmental problem. Nevertheless, plastic may also serve as a potential carbon and energy source for microbes, yet the contribution of marine microbes, especially marine fungi to plastic degradation is not well constrained. We isolated the fungus Parengyodontium album from floating plastic debris in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and measured fungal-mediated mineralization rates (conversion to CO2) of polyethylene (PE) by applying stable isotope probing assays with 13C-PE over 9 days of incubation. When the PE was pretreated with UV light, the biodegradation rate of the initially added PE was 0.044 %/day. Furthermore, we traced the incorporation of PE-derived 13C carbon into P. album biomass using nanoSIMS and fatty acid analysis. Despite the high mineralization rate of the UV-treated 13C-PE, incorporation of PE-derived 13C into fungal cells was minor, and 13C incorporation was not detectable for the non-treated PE. Together, our results reveal the potential of P. album to degrade PE in the marine environment and to mineralize it to CO2. However, the initial photodegradation of PE is crucial for P. album to metabolize the PE-derived carbon. © 2024,\n",
       " The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reshaped global environmental dynamics, with coastal and marine ecosystems among the most affected areas. This adjustment period has also seen a surge in tourist activities in these regions, necessitating advanced strategies for marine debris management (MDM). Our study introduces an enhanced approach to MDM in the post-pandemic era, integrating essential attributes such as asset facilities, 3R flexibility (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), responsive organizational structures, education on the impact of marine debris, and agency motivation within an adaptive capacity framework. By evaluating marginal willingness to participate (MWTP) across three hypothetical scenarios, our research highlights the comprehensive adaptation of the MDM scenario as the most effective, evidenced by the highest MWTP. This indicates a pronounced community readiness to engage in an integrated MDM approach, crucial in increasing tourist visits and challenging existing MDM frameworks. Our findings illustrate the necessity of an integrated approach to bolster MDM effectiveness in managing the heightened debris load from the post-pandemic resurgence of tourism. The incremental increase in MWTP across scenarios suggests that embracing more inclusive and unified strategies can significantly enhance community participation and the efficacy of MDM practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MP) have repeatedly been found in commercially cultured species of bivalves. There are concerns regarding the amount of MP released into the environment by aquaculture activities, and questions regarding possible higher MP loads in farm-grown shellfish compared to levels in shellfish collected from recreational beds. To explore this concept, seawater, aquaculture gear, and eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were sampled from an aquaculture site in Niantic Bay, CT, USA, and a 2-week transplantation experiment was performed in which oysters were transplanted between the aquaculture site and a plastic-free cage off the dock at the University of Connecticut-Avery Point campus. The digestive gland-stomach complex (gut) was dissected from the oysters and MP were extracted from the adjacent seawater and oyster gut samples using previously validated extraction methods. Extensive quality assurance and control measures were taken to reduce MP contamination. Particles in all samples were isolated, imaged under a stereomicroscope, and characterized (size, shape, polymer) using ImageJ software and micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Water samples contained 0–0.3 MP/L and oyster gut samples contained 0–1.3 MP/g wet weight indicating very low concentrations of MP at the farm (0–2 MP/individual) or away from the farm (0–3 MP/individual). Aquaculture gear in this area is not contributing to MP ingestion in farmed oysters or elevated MP levels in the surrounding water. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics（MPs）are ubiquitous in the marine environment and have become an emerging pollutant that is attracting great attention. To reveal the pollution characteristics of MPs in surface seawater of coastal waters in Guangdong Province，nine bays（estuaries）were selected from Jiangmen to Shantou. The distribution and compositional characteristics of MPs were investigated through field sampling，oxidation digestion，and visual and compositional identification，and their potential sources were analyzed. The ecological risks were assessed by combining the pollution load index and the polymer risk index. The results showed that MPs were detected in all 30 surface seawater samples from the coastal waters of Guangdong Province，with an abundance range of 70-920 n·m−3 and an average abundance of（295.3 ± 175.3）n·m−3. The highest MPs abundance was found in the Pearl River estuary，and the lowest abundance was found in Shenquan bay. The distribution patterns were mainly influenced by human activities and ocean currents. The dominant polymer types included polypropylene（31.2%），phenol resin（16.0%），polyethylene terephthalate（15.3%），and polyethylene（10.9%）. The main shape，color，and size categories of MPs were fiber（57.5%），transparent（72.0%），and 0.5-1 mm（32.8%），respectively. The possible sources of MPs mainly included aquaculture，fishing，navigation，tourism，municipal sewage discharge，and ocean current transportation. The model assessment results showed that the pollution load risk of MPs was relatively low，but the polymer risk was at a medium-high level. This study provides a data basis for the action plan of plastic pollution control in Guangdong Province and supports the prevention and control of marine MPs pollution. © 2024 Science Press.

       " Micro/nano-plastics, as emerging persistent pollutant, are frequently detected in aquatic environments together with other environmental pollutants. Microalgae are the major primary producers and bear an important responsibility for maintaining the balance of aquatic ecosystems. Numerous studies have been conducted on the influence of micro/nano-plastics on the growth, photosynthesis, oxidative stress, gene expression and metabolites of microalgae in laboratory studies. However, it is difficult to comprehensively evaluate the toxic effects of micro/nano-plastics on microalgae due to different experimental designs. Moreover, there is a lack of effective analysis of the aforementioned multi-omics data and reports on shared biological patterns. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to compare the acute, chronic, pulsed, and combined effect of micro/nano-plastics on microalgae and explore hidden rules in the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between them. Results showed that the effect of micro/nano-plastics on microalgae was related to exposure mode, exposure duration, exposure size, concentration, and type of micro/nano-plastics. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of poisoning and detoxification between micro/nano-plastics and microalgae was found. The inhibitory mechanism of micro/nano-plastics on algal growth was due to the micro/nano-plastics affected the photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome pathways of algal cells. This brought the disruption of the functions of chloroplasts, mitochondria, and ribosome, as well as impacted on energy metabolism and translation pathways, eventually leading to impairment of cell function. Besides, algae resisted this inhibitory effect by regulating the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism and purine metabolism pathways, thereby increasing the chlorophyll synthesis, inhibiting the increase of reactive oxygen species, delaying the process of lipid peroxidation, balancing the osmotic pressure of cell membrane. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Jakarta Metropolitan is known as the most populated and busiest city in Indonesia and among the top urban areas in the world with a common problem of solid and liquid waste. The present study aimed to assess the occurrence of microplastic (MP) pollution in sediment from the downstream rivers and coastal water of Jakarta Bay and estimate the potential risk to the ecosystem. Two composite sediment samples (river and coastal) were collected from the Jakarta Bay estuary. Distribution of sediment size showed that the medium size (100–500 µm) was the most dominant in river and coastal samples. Our finding demonstrated the highest MP concentration reported from the estuary ecosystem, i.e., 1184–1337 particles/100 g of river sediment and 804–1055 particles/100 g of coastal sediment. Classification based on size category revealed that the medium size (100–500 µm) was the most dominant MP in river sediment, while the smaller one (50–100 µm) was the most dominant MP in the coastal sediment. The present study indicates that terrestrial origin contributes to the MP pollution of Jakarta Bay. Polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were the most dominant polymers in the river and coastal sediments. The risk assessment of MP pollution in Jakarta Bay estuary potentially exhibits a very high risk to the ecosystem, primarily related to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyurethane (PU) polymers and the MP sizes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The contamination of microplastics in terrestrial geoenvironment (CMTG) is widespread and severe and has, received considerable attention. However, studies on CMTG are in their initial stages. The literature on CMTG published in the past decade was analyzed through bibliometric analysis, such as the annual publications, countries with the highest contributions, prolific authors, and author keywords. The sources, compositions, migrations and environmental impacts of CMTG are summarized, and possible future directions are proposed. This study analyzed the annual publications, countries with the highest contributions, prolific authors, and author keywords related to microplastics. The results demonstrated that 15,306 articles were published between 2014 and 2023. China is the leading country in terms of the total number of publications. The main sources of CMTG include landfills, agricultural non-point sources, sewage treatment systems and transportation systems. The composition of the CMTG exhibits significantly temporal and spatial variability from different sources. The migration paths of the CMTG were within the soil, groundwater seepage and wind transportation of suspended particles. Microplastics increase soil cohesion, decrease porosity, reduce pore scale, decrease air circulation, and increase water retention capacity, and the exudation of highly water-soluble additives in microplastics can cause secondary contamination of geological entities. Microplastics have an adverse effect on plant growth, animal digestion, microbial activity, energy and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and respiratory diseases in humans. It is recommended to develop more efficient and convenient quantitative testing methods for microplastics, formulate globally harmonized testing and evaluation standards, include microplastic testing in testing programs for contaminated soils, and develop efficient methods for the remediation of microplastic contaminated geological bodies. © 2024,\n",
       " The debate surrounding “source” and “sink” of microplastics (MPs) in coastal water has persisted for decades. While the transportation of MPs is influenced by surface runoff and currents, the precise transport patterns remain inadequately defined. In this study, the typical coastal habitat – marine ranching in Haizhou Bay (Jiangsu Province, China) were selected as a case study to assess the ecological risk of MPs. An enhanced framework was employed to assess the entire community characteristics of MPs in various environmental compartments, including surface water (SW), middle water (MW), bottom water (BW), sea bottom sediment (SS), and intertidal sediment (IS). The results of the assessment showed a low risk in the water column and a high risk in the sediment. PERMANOVA based on size and polymer of MPs revealed significant differences between IS and other compartments (SW, MW, BW, and SS) (P < 0.001). The co–occurrence network analysis for MP size indicated that most sites occupied central positions, while the analysis for MP polymer suggested that sites near the marine ranching area held more central positions, with sites in MW, BW, and SS being somewhat related to IS. Generalized additive model (GAM) demonstrated that MP concentration in the water correlated with Chla and nutrients, whereas MPs in sediment exhibited greater susceptibility to dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity. We believe that except for the natural sedimentation and re–suspension of MPs in the vertical direction, MPs in bottom water may migrate to the surface water due to upwelling mediated by artificial reefs. Additionally, under the combined influence of surface runoff, currents, and tides, MPs may migrate horizontally, primarily occurring between middle and bottom water and sediments. The study recommends limiting and reducing wastewater and sewage discharge, as well as regulating fishing and aquaculture activities to control the sources and sinks of MPs in coastal water. Moreover, it advocates the implementation and strengthening of marine monitoring activities to gain a better understanding of the factors driving MP pollution in marine ranching area. © 2024,\n",
       " Despite a recent ambitious plan to improve waste management in Thailand, few studies have monitored the impact of these policies on beached marine litter. Here, we assessed weekly the amounts and composition of stranded macro-litter (≥2.5 cm) on five beaches from an uninhabited island in Thailand during one year. A total of 24,407 items (391.86 kg) yielded a mean abundance of 3.18 ± 11.39 items m−2 (52.75 ± 204.68 g m−2), with plastic being the most abundant marine litter (48% of the total number). The overall Clean Coast Index (30.1) classified the beaches as ‘extremely dirty’, with a Plastic Abundance Index of 9.8 (‘very high abundance’ of plastics). When assessing the seasonal rates of accumulation, we found a higher flux pre-monsoon (0.05 items m−2 d−1; 0.66 g m−2 d−1) than post-monsoon (0.01 items m−2 d−1; 0.35 g m−2 d−1). Using modeling of the local hydrodynamic conditions, we explored the potential sources of the pollution, and surprisingly found that the closest river appeared not to be the source. Our results denote that the distribution and typology of marine litter were representatives of household and fishing activities, which in turn highlights the need for better regional litter management measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Due to rapid urbanization, there have been continuous environmental threats from different pollutants, especially from microplastics. Plastic products rapidly proliferate significantly contributing to the occurrence of micro-plastics, which poses a significant environmental risk. These microplastics originated from diverse sources and are characterized by their persistent and widespread occurrence; human health and the entire ecosystem are adversely affected by them. The removal of microplastics not only requires innovative technologies but also efficient materials capable of effectively eliminating them from our environment. The progress made so far has highlighted the advantages of utilizing the dimensional and structural properties of nanomaterials to increase the effectiveness of existing methods for micro-plastic treatment, aiming for a more sustainable approach to their removal. In the current review, we demonstrate a thorough overview of the sources, occurrences, and potential harmful effects of microplastics, followed by a further discussion of promising technologies used for their removal. An in-depth examination of both advantages and a few limitations of all these given technologies, including physical, chemical, and biological approaches, has been discussed. Additionally, the review explores the use of nanomaterials as an effective means to overcome obstacles and improve the efficiency of microplastic elimination methods. n conclusion, this review addresses, current challenges in this field and outlines the future perspectives for further research in this domain. © 2023,\n",
       " Stormwater is widely recognized as a pathway for transporting pollutants, including microplastics, from sources in urban environments to receiving waters. Gully pots are often where urban runoff drains into the piped network; they typically include a trap where sediments accumulate. The aim of this work was to contribute to a better understanding of the fate of microplastics as they enter into the urban drainage system, and the role of gully pots in trapping microplastics. Sediment samples collected from 29 gully pots were analysed for non-carbon-black and carbon-black (e.g. tire wear particles) microplastics larger than 40 μm using μ-FTIR and ATR-FTIR, respectively. Commonly found polymers in descending order were PP > EPDM > EVA > PS > SBR, PP was most common both by mass and by number of microplastics. The total concentration of carbon black and non-carbon black microplastics ranged from 709 to 10 600 items/100 g dry matter (DM), (median: 2960 items/100 g). Estimated mass of non-carbon black microplastics ranged from 0.19 to 490 mg/100 g, (median: 3.66 mg/100 g). In total 21 different types of microplastics were detected, the majority of these (13) were carbon black and eight non-carbon black polymer types. By number and the carbon black particles accounted for up to 68% of the microplastics (average 30%), this stress the importance of using analytical methods enabling the detection of both carbon-black and non-carbon black microplastics. Furthermore, the results indicate that gully pots can act as temporary sinks for microplastics, mainly for microplastics larger than 125 μm. The amount of microplastics found in gully pots, together with the very large number of gully pots sited in urban areas, indicates that gully pots can potentially trap large amounts of microplastics, and thus if gully pots are fitted and maintained properly they could significantly contribute to reducing the amount of microplastics reaching receiving waters. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Globally, microplastics have been identified in a diverse range of environments. However, the extent of microplastic pollution in South Africa's context is largely lacking. In this study, an investigation of microplastic pollution was conducted across the Durban Bay harbour located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Microplastic evaluation was performed both on surface water and sediment samples, collected from various spots across the harbour. Microplastics were extracted and analysed for their characteristics using visual identification on stereomicroscopes, and chemical characterisation using Raman-microscopy. Microplastics were detected in all samples, with abundances of up to 80.72 MP m−3 in surface water samples, and 1.76 MP g−1 in sediments. Fibres and fragments were the most observed morphologies in both surface water and sediment samples. In this case, the detected fibres comprised up to 75.68% in surface waters, and 45.54% in sediments, while fragments reached 19.84% in surface waters, and 41.07% in sediment samples. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyester were the most dominant polymers observed in the investigated samples. In general, higher microplastic abundances were found in the study sites located near the river inflows and stormwater drains, with anthropogenic activities such as shipping bays. Overall, the microplastic abundance in Durban Bay was comparable with the levels found in other studies within South Africa and across the globe. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution constitutes a substantially detrimental type of environmental contamination and poses threats to human health. Among the sources of airborne and marine microplastics, evidence indicates that non-exhaust emissions resulting from tire abrasion and other organic materials have emerged as a notable contributor. However, the mechanistic understanding of abrasion emission of organic materials has remained elusive. To fill the gap, we here develop a multi-scale abrasion mechanics model using the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Macroscopically, material wear and tear can be viewed as a process of macro-crack propagation associated with the fatigue fracture. Microscopically, we consider the effect of microcracks propagating under cyclic loading on the material modulus and energy release rate during fatigue fracture. This framework leads to an evaluation of the effective energy release rate for the abrasion-induced emission of particulate matter, thus leading to a calculation of the concentration of the emitted particulate matter with varied sizes. The theory is validated by corresponding experiments and high consistency is exhibited between the theoretical and experimental results. This research constructs a quantitative relationship between fracture mechanics and abrasion emissions. This research not only paves the way for a mechanistic understanding of particulate matter pollution from a solid mechanics perspective but also offers rational guidance for modern society to alleviate airborne particulate matter and marine microplastic abrasion emissions. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), recognized as an emerging global environmental concern, have been extensively detected worldwide, with specific attention directed towards the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and East China Sea (ECS) regions. Despite their critical research significance, there remains a knowledge gap concerning the distribution of MPs in the benthic layer within this area, particularly regarding interactions governing their occurrence. Here we illuminate the distribution of MPs within the benthic layer and unravel the intricate interplay between bottom water and sediment in the YRE and ECS. We find that MPs are notably more abundant in bottom water, ranging from 8 to 175 times higher than in surface water. These MPs predominantly consist of polyester fibers, exhibit a size range between 0.5 and 5.0 mm, and display distinct coloration. Co-occurrence network analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis confirm a robust correlation between MPs in bottom water and sediment, signifying the pivotal role of bottom water in mediating the distribution and transportation of MPs within the benthic layer. Furthermore, a positive correlation between MPs in sediment and bottom water turbidity underscores the impact of surface sediment resuspension and upwelling on MPs distribution. This study clarifies the intricate interactions within the benthic layer and highlights the crucial role of bottom water as a mediator in the vertical distribution of MPs, advancing our understanding of the “source-to-sink” transport processes governing MPs within water-sediment systems. © 2023 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic contamination in agricultural soil is an emerging problem worldwide as it contaminates the food chain. Therefore, this research investigated the distribution of microplastics (MPs) in agricultural soils without mulch at various depths (0–5, 5–10, and 10–15 cm) across different zones: rural, local market, industrial, coastal, and research areas. The detection of MP types and morphology was conducted using FTIR and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Eight types of MPs were identified, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl fluoride (PVF), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), with concentrations ranging from 0.6 ± 0.21 to 3.71 ± 2.36 MPs/g of soil. The study found no significant trends in MP concentration, with ranges of 0–2.1 ± 0.38, 0–2.87 ± 0.55, and 0–2.0 ± 0.34 MPs/g of soil at depths of 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, and 10–15 cm, respectively. The highest MP quantity was recorded at 8.67 in coastal area, while the lowest was 6.44 in the local market area. Various MP shapes, e.g., fiber, film, pellet, fragment, and irregular, were observed across all layers. PCA suggested irrigation and organic manure as potential sources of MPs. The estimated concentrations of MPs possessed low non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to the farming community of Bangladesh. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pose significant risks to marine ecosystems and human health, necessitating accurate predictions of their distributions in aquatic environments for effective risk mitigation. However, understanding MP transport dynamics is challenging because of the inadequate representation of MP characteristics such as size, shape, and density in numerical models. Further, the accuracy of the MP vertical profiles in existing models has not been thoroughly validated. Thus, we developed an MP transport model within the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model framework (FVCOM-MP) by integrating MP characteristics. We validated FVCOM-MP against experimental and analytical data, focusing on various MP transport modes and transitions. FVCOM-MP successfully replicates MP profiles in different transport modes, including the bedload, surface load, suspended load, and mixed load modes. Additionally, we introduce phase diagrams for classifying MP transport modes based on particle characteristics, enhancing our understanding of MP dynamics in aquatic systems. The transport modes for a number of real-world MP particles, including fishing line, plastic bag/bottle fragments, synthetic fibers, tire wear particles, polyvinyl chloride and expanded polystyrene pellets, were analyzed with these phase diagrams. © 2024,\n",
       " Rivers have been recognized as the primary conveyors of microplastics to the oceans, and seaward transport flux of riverine microplastics is an issue of global attention. However, there is a significant discrepancy in how microplastic concentration is expressed in field occurrence investigations (number concentration) and in mass flux (mass concentration). Of urgent need is to establish efficient conversion models to correlate these two important paradigms. Here, we first established an abundant environmental microplastic dataset and then employed a deep neural residual network (ResNet50) to successfully separate microplastics into fiber, fragment, and pellet shapes with 92.67% accuracy. We also used the circularity (C) parameter to represent the surface shape alteration of pellet-shaped microplastics, which always have a more uneven surface than other shapes. Furthermore, we added thickness information to two-dimensional images, which has been ignored by most prior research because labor-intensive processes were required. Eventually, a set of accurate models for microplastic mass conversion was developed, with absolute estimation errors of 7.1, 3.1, 0.2, and 0.9% for pellet (0.50 ≤ C < 0.75), pellet (0.75 ≤ C ≤ 1.00), fiber, and fragment microplastics, respectively; environmental samples have validated that this set is significantly faster (saves ∼2 h/100 MPs) and less biased (7-fold lower estimation errors) compared to previous empirical models. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " The widespread presence of micro-sized plastic pollution has raised concerns due to their unique physical and toxic properties. Each year, water bodies carry millions of tons of plastic into the ocean. The inherent characteristics (such as size, shape, and density) of microplastics (MPs), along with flow factors like speed, depth, and pressure, significantly influence how MPs are transported and deposited. Therefore, this research aimed to gather experimental data on the transport and deposition of MPs to serve as a benchmark for numerical modeling. To achieve this goal, various test scenarios were set up in a straight channel flume to investigate different flow velocities, channel dimensions, and particle shapes. It was observed that cylindrical particles with the same density and similar size were more likely to become trapped compared to spherical particles. This study represents progress towards validating numerical models concerning the transport and deposition of microplastics. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Halogenated organic contaminants, such as chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl/Br-PAHs), are some of the most important emerging environmental pollutants. However, empirical data on Cl/Br-PAHs in estuarine and marine ecosystems are limited, rendering assessments of Cl/Br-PAH contamination in estuarine and offshore environments uncertain. Here the occurrence, sources, and ecological risks of 7 Cl-PAHs and 18 Br-PAHs were determined in surface sediments of the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), a highly urbanized and industrialized area, and its adjacent marine area. The concentrations of Cl-PAHs ranged from 4.50 to 18.38 ng g−1 (average 7.19 ng g−1), while those of Br-PAHs ranged from 4.80 to 61.18 ng g−1 (average 14.11 ng g−1). The dominant Cl-PAH and Br-PAH in surface sediment were 9-chlorofluorene (17.79%) and 9-bromofluorene (58.49%), respectively. The distributions and compositions of Cl/Br-PAHs in the surface sediments varied considerably due to complex hydrodynamic and depositional conditions in the YRE and its adjacent marine area, as well as differences in physicochemical properties of different Cl/Br-PAHs. Positive matrix factorization revealed that the primary sources of Cl/Br-PAHs in the study area were e-waste dismantling (33.6%), waste incineration (23.2%), and metal smelting (11.0%). According to the risk quotient, the Cl/Br-PAHs in sediments posed no toxic risk to aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Petroleum-based microplastic particles (MPs) are carriers of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, influencing the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance. This research characterized MP and natural organic particle (NOP) bacterial communities and resistomes in the Tyrrhenian Sea, a region impacted by plastic pollution and climate change. MP and NOP bacterial communities were similar but different from the free-living planktonic communities. Likewise, MP and NOP ARG abundances were similar but different (higher) from the planktonic communities. MP and NOP metagenome-assembled genomes contained ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements and exhibited co-occurrence with metal resistance genes. Overall, these findings show that MPs and NOPs harbor potential pathogenic and antimicrobial resistant bacteria, which can aid in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Further, petroleum-based MPs do not represent novel ecological niches for allochthonous bacteria; rather, they synergize with NOPs, collectively facilitating the spread of antimicrobial resistance in marine ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a worldwide problem especially in the marine environment. Plastic items once fragmented into microplastics (MPs), can be captured by different marine species. Benthic filter feeders like sponges and polychaetas, due to their trophic strategy, are highly exposed to MPs pollution. Herein a simple but effective method to digest the fan worm Sabella spallanzanii and the calcareous sponge Paraleucilla magna is presented: a solution with KOH and H2O2 was able to remove quantitatively (more than 98 %) the organic matter in 3 h while an acid treatment dissolved most of spicules and chaetes in less than 30 min. MPs were easily identified both microscopically and spectroscopically on filters. Quantification in animals collected from the same environment showed that, on average, sponges accumulate fewer MPs than polychaetes (66 ± 31 and 117 ± 46 particles/g dry weight, respectively). The plastic recovery of the method was validated using three different approaches (spiking of standard PS microspheres, of common-use plastic objects, and of microplastics already weathered in marine environment). This procedure can make it easier and cost-effective to process biota in monitoring studies, providing information about bioindicator/bioremediation species. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Anthropogenic debris is a global threat that impacts threatened species through various lethal and sub-lethal consequences, as well as overall ecosystem health. This study used a database of over 24,000 beach surveys of marine debris collated by the Australian Marine Debris Initiative from 2012 to 2021, with two key objectives: (1) identify variables that most influence the occurrence of debris hotspots on a continental scale and (2) use these findings to identify likely hotspots of interaction between threatened species and marine debris. The number of particles found in each beach survey was modelled alongside fifteen biological, social, and physical spatial variables including land use, physical oceanography, population, rainfall, distance to waste facilities, ports, and mangroves to identify the significant drivers of debris deposition. The model of best fit for predicting debris particle abundance was calculated using a generalized additive model. Overall, debris was more abundant at sites near catchments with high annual rainfall (mm), intensive land use (km2), and that were nearer to ports (km) and mangroves (km). These results support previous studies which state that mangroves are a significant sink for marine debris, and that large ports and urbanized catchments are significant sources for marine debris. We illustrate the applicability of these models by quantifying significant overlap between debris hotspots and the distributions for four internationally listed threatened species that exhibit debris interactions; green turtle (26,868 km2), dugong (16,164 km2), Australian sea lion (2903 km2) and Flesh-footed Shearwater (2413 km2). This equates to less than 1% (Flesh-footed Shearwater, Australian sea lion), over 2% (green sea turtle) and over 5% (dugong) of their habitat being identified as areas of high risk for marine debris interactions. The results of this study hold practical value, informing decision-making processes, managing debris pollution at continental scales, as well as identifying gaps in species monitoring. © 2024 The Authors.

       " The increasing prevalence of microplastics (MP) in urban environments has raised concerns over their negative effects on ecosystems and human health. Stormwater runoff, and road dust and sediment, act as major vectors of these pollutants into natural water bodies. Sustainable urban drainage systems, such as permeable pavements, are considered as potential tools to retain particulate pollutants. This research evaluates at laboratory scale the efficiency of permeable interlocking concrete pavements (PICP) and porous concrete pavements (PCP) for controlling microplastics, including tire wear particles (TWP) which constitute a large fraction of microplastics in urban environments, simulating surface pollution accumulation and Mediterranean rainfall conditions. Microplastic levels in road dust and sediments and stormwater runoff inputs were 4762 ± 974 MP/kg (dry weight) and 23.90 ± 17.40 MP/L. In infiltrated effluents, microplastic levels ranged from 2.20 ± 0.61 to 5.17 ± 1.05 MP/L; while tire wear particle levels ranged between 0.28 ± 0.28 and 3.30 ± 0.89 TWP/L. Distribution of microplastics within the layers of PICP and PCP were also studied and quantified. Microplastics tend to accumulate on the pavements surface and in geotextile layers, allowing microplastic retention efficiencies from 89 % to 99.6 %. Small sized (< 0.1 mm) fragment shaped microplastics are the most common in effluent samples. The results indicate that permeable pavements are a powerful tool to capture microplastics and tire wear particles, especially by surface and geotextile layers. The study aims to shed light on the complex mobilisation mechanisms of microplastics, providing valuable insights for addressing the growing environmental concern of microplastic pollution in urban areas. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics are ubiquitous in marine environments and can be incorporated into biological aggregates including marine snows and faecal pellets. These aggregates are suspected to be a major removal mechanism for microplastics from the surface ocean, transporting them to deeper levels and the seafloor as they sink and remineralise. However, simple budget calculations, observations, and model parameter testing suggest that aggregation might also lead to retention of microplastics in the upper ocean, sustaining contamination in biologically-productive environments. The ability of the biological microplastic sink to reduce water column contamination has relevance to the setting of ocean plastics pollution reduction targets, as are currently under negotiation by the International Negotiating Committee of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA). Here we apply eight idealised global pollution reduction trajectories, from 1%-100% per year, starting from the year 2026 and ending in the year 2100 to an Earth System Climate Model with a representation of ocean microplastics and their aggregation in biological particles. We find that the global ocean microplastic inventory and surface concentrations stabilize within this century for reduction rates exceeding 5% per year but the inventory does not substantially decrease under any trajectory. Furthermore, microplastics are retained by marine biology in the surface ocean, where concentrations stabilise to a non-zero value over decades. Lastly we find that irrespective of scenario, contamination of deeper ocean layers continues to increase for the duration of our simulations via the export of microplastics by biological aggregates. These results suggest that ambitious targets for pollution reduction exceeding 5% per year will be required to progress the resolution of the UNEA to ‘end plastic pollution’ in this century, and that ongoing microplastic contamination of the marine food web may be unavoidable. © 2024 The Author(s).

       " Micro-sized particles of synthetic polymers (microplastics) are found in all parts of marine ecosystems. This fact requires intensive study of the degree of danger of such particles to the life activity of hydrobionts and needs additional research. It is evident that hydrobionts in the marine environment are exposed to microplastics modified by biotic and abiotic degradation. To assess the toxic potential of aging microplastic, comparative studies were conducted on the response of cytochemical and genotoxic markers in hemocytes of the mussel Mytilus trossulus (Gould, 1850) after exposure to pristine and photodegraded (UV irradiation) polystyrene microparticles (µPS). The results of cytochemical tests showed that UV-irradiated µPS strongly reduced metabolism and destabilized lysosome membranes compared to pristine µPS. Using a Comet assay, it was shown that the nuclear DNA of mussel hemocytes showed high sensitivity to exposure to both types of plastics. However, the level of DNA damage was significantly higher in mussels exposed to aging µPS. It is suggested that the mechanism of increased toxicity of photo-oxidized µPS is based on free-radical reactions induced by the UV irradiation of polymers. The risks of toxic effects will be determined by the level of physicochemical degradation of the polymer, which can significantly affect the mechanisms of toxicity. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " In Nigeria, limited research has been conducted on Microplastics (MPs) in inland rivers, necessitating a comprehensive assessment to understand the extent of contamination. This study aimed to assess the abundance, distribution, and composition of MPs in fishes, sediment, and water from inland rivers across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. Samples were collected from selected rivers in each geopolitical zone (Rivers Yauri, Benue, Argungu, Jamare, Ogun, Ethiope and Orashi). MPs were isolated using a combination of filtration, density separation, and visual identification. MPs abundance, distribution, shapes, colors, and chemical composition were determined using microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The study presents the first report of MPs in six in land rivers in Nigeria and found that MPs were present in all the fishes, sediments and river waters studied across all the rivers. The abundance and composition of MPs varied among the different sample types, with fibers being the most abundant shape in both water and fish samples. PET, PP, and PE were the most prevalent types of plastics found in fish samples, while PE/PA/Nylon, PVA, and PVC were predominant in water samples. PA/Nylon, PUR, PVC, and PET were the most common in sediment samples. Source analysis by Principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) indicated that the presence of MPs was mainly influenced by local anthropogenic activities. However, estimated daily intakes are generally low, indicating that daily consumption of the samples is not likely to be harmful. The widespread presence of MPs in inland rivers across Nigeria highlights the urgent need for effective waste management strategies and environmental conservation efforts to mitigate plastic pollution. © 2024 The Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology/Korea Society for Environmental Analysis.,\n",
       " The intensification of microplastics (MPs) pollution has emerged as a formidable environmental challenge, with profound global implications. The pervasive presence of MPs across a multitude of environmental mediums, such as the atmosphere, soil, and oceans, extends to commonplace items, culminating in widespread human ingestion and accumulation via channels like food, water, and air. In the domestic realm, kitchens have become significant epicenters for MPs pollution. A plethora of kitchen utensils, encompassing coated non-stick pans, plastic cutting boards, and disposable utensils, are known to release substantial quantities of MPs particles in everyday use, which can then be ingested alongside food. This paper conducts a thorough examination of contemporary research addressing the release of MPs from kitchen utensils during usage and focuses on the health risks associated with MPs ingestion, as well as the myriad factors influencing the release of MPs in kitchen utensils. Leveraging the insights derived from this analysis, this paper proposes a series of strategic recommendations and measures targeted at mitigating the production of MPs in kitchen settings. These initiatives are designed not solely to diminish the release of MPs but also to enhance public awareness regarding this pressing environmental concern. By adopting more informed practices in kitchens, we can significantly contribute to the reduction of the environmental burden of MPs pollution, thus safeguarding both human health and the ecological system. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and concentrated brine are widely present in the coastal area due to accelerated human activities. However, the changes in the adsorption behavior of microplastics for different pollutants under high salinity conditions and their effects on the single/complex behavior of aquatic organisms are not yet clear. In this work, polystyrene (PS) and polyamide (PA) microplastics were selected to study their effect on the adsorption behavior of three typical water pollutants (Pb2+, 4-chlorophenol, and levofloxacin) at high salinity. Furthermore, the individual and combined toxic effects of MPs and high salinity on Synechococcus were primarily explored. Activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, concentrations of reduced glutathione and chlorophyll-a were employed as toxic indicators. Our results showed that salinity significantly changes the adsorption behavior of the three pollutants onto MPs and alters the toxic effect of MPs. Under the condition of 6% salinity and 10 mg/L MPs, PS-MPs did not significantly affect the cellular metabolism and photosynthetic efficiency of Synechococcus, while PA-MPs showed an evident synergistic effect with the high salinity. Copresence of high salinity with MPs reduced the individual toxic effect of PS-MPs and PA-MPs. This study shows that high salinity seawater can significantly alter the adsorption behavior of microplastics to other pollutants and their toxic effects on organisms. The impact of high-salinity brine on the marine ecology should be considered before construction of desalination projects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution poses an escalating concern, particularly in coastal lagoons rich in biodiversity. This study delved into the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in Magallana gigas (formerly Crassostrea gigas) from the Orbetello and Varano coastal lagoons (Italy), also investigating the response of these filter-feeding organisms to various colors (P = pink; B = blue; W = white) of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) MP fragments. Oysters were exposed for 7 days under controlled conditions. Subsequently, the oysters underwent analysis for both MP presence and biochemical markers of oxidative stress. Diverse ingestion rates of HDPE were noted among oysters from the two lagoons, eliciting antioxidant responses and modifying baseline activity. The two-way ANOVA revealed the significant effects of treatment (control; HDPE_B; HDPE_P; HDPE_W), site, and the interaction between treatment and site on all biomarkers. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a divergent effect of HDPE color on biomarkers. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the influence of MP color, dose-dependent effects, and the long-term impacts of exposure. Comprehending these intricacies is imperative for devising effective strategies to mitigate plastic pollution and safeguard marine health. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " This Feature Article reports general and more specific aspects about microplastic (MP) contamination in continental and marine waters as well as in terrestrial environment. It describes a critical vision of the analytical methods commonly used for MP characterization and determination, including recommendations on green analytical chemistry (GAC) protocols. Insights into MPs as sorption materials and carriers for a variety of emerging contaminants like pharmaceuticals and pesticides are highlighted. Risks to biota living in aquatic and terrestrial environments and human-health-related effects with specific examples of surface and groundwater used for drinking water sources near contaminated sites like landfills are summarized. Lastly, sustainable solutions for how to improve the analysis and comparison of MP detection at the global level is given, including the need for standardized analytical protocols as well as the performance of additional interlaboratory exercises. Additional recommendations include a global database on MP levels made available to all authors to better compare their data qualitatively with that previously published.

       " Micro/nanoplastics in aquatic environments is a noteworthy environmental problem. Zooplankton, an important biological group in aquatic ecosystems, readily absorb micro/nanoplastics and produce a range of toxic endpoints due to their small size. This review summarises relevant studies on the effects of micro/nanoplastics on zooplankton, including combined effects with conventional pollutants. Frequently reported adverse effects include acute/chronic lethal effects, oxidative stress, gene expression, energetic homeostasis, and growth and reproduction. Obstruction by plastic entanglement and blockage is the physical mechanism. Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are molecular mechanisms. Properties of micro/nanoplastics, octanol/water partition coefficients of conventional pollutants, species and intestinal environments are important factors influencing single and combined toxicity. Selecting a wider range of micro/nanoplastics, focusing on the aging process and conducting field studies, adopting diversified zooplankton models, and further advancing the study of mechanisms are the outstanding prospects for deeper understanding of impacts of micro/nanoplastics on aquatic ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) in natural waters are heterogeneously mixed with other natural particles including algal cells and suspended sediments. An easy-to-use and rapid method for directly measuring and distinguishing MPs from other naturally present colloids in the environment would expedite analytical workflows. Here, we established a database of MP scattering and fluorescence properties, either alone or in mixtures with natural particles, by stain-free flow cytometry. The resulting high-dimensional data were analyzed using machine learning approaches, either unsupervised (e.g., viSNE) or supervised (e.g., random forest algorithms). We assessed our approach in identifying and quantifying model MPs of diverse sizes, morphologies, and polymer compositions in various suspensions including phototrophic microorganisms, suspended biofilms, mineral particles, and sediment. We could precisely quantify MPs in microbial phototrophs and natural sediments with high organic carbon by both machine learning models (identification accuracies over 93%), although it was not possible to distinguish between different MP sizes or polymer compositions. By testing the resulting method in environmental samples through spiking MPs into freshwater samples, we further highlight the applicability of the method to be used as a rapid screening tool for MPs. Collectively, this workflow can be easily applied to a diverse set of samples to assess the presence of MPs in a time-efficient manner. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Despite the Gulf of Mexico having one of the world’s highest microplastic concentrations, there is a paucity of information regarding the impact of microplastic pollution on its coastal systems. Using a Lagrangian particle-tracking model coupled with a validated 3D hydrodynamic model, we examined the retention and transport pathway of microplastic particles released from major rivers and bayous in Texas and Louisiana to the Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis was placed on retention time within estuaries and connectivity of particles along the coastline past the initial release location. Magnitude of river inflow has significant impacts on how long particles are retained in estuaries, with high flows (within Galveston Bay and eastward) flushing particles out in less than a year while low flows (west of Galveston Bay) often have the majority of particles still retained after the two-year simulation. Single, high flow events are found to decrease the retention time, highlighting the potential of storms to flush microplastics out of estuaries and into the Gulf. Seasonality of shelf current impacts where along the coast microplastics travel and other estuaries they enter. Settling behavior of particles results in increased retention time within estuaries but a comparable impact on coastal areas. © 2024 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society,\n",
       " The presence of nanoplastics posed a potential threat to coastal saline-alkaline wetlands where nitrogen (N) fertilizer is being implemented as an important ecological restoration measure. Notwithstanding, the effects of N inputs on plant community in polypropylene-nanoplastics (PP-NPs) coexistence environments are largely unknown. To address this, we investigated the effects of PP-NPs addition alone or combined N supply on community aboveground biomass, morphological traits, diversity, composition, niche differentiation, interspecific interactions, and assembly. Our results showed that the PP-NPs addition alone reduced community aboveground biomass and morphological traits. However, the addition of high concentration (0.5%) PP-NPs alone favored community α-diversity and reduced community stability, which could be weakened through combined N supply. Overall, the effect of PP-NPs addition alone on plant community composition was greater than that of combined N supply. We also demonstrated PP-NPs addition alone and combined N supply reduced the niche breadth of the plant community and affected the niche overlap of dominant species. In the assembly of plant communities, stochastic processes played a dominant role. We conclude that N fertilization can amend the terrestrial nanoplastics pollution, thus mitigating the effects of PP-NPs on the plant community. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Marine floating debris, particularly chemically stable plastics, poses a significant global environmental concern. These materials, due to their prevalence and durability, linger on the ocean surface for extended durations, inflicting considerable harm on marine ecosystems, life, and the food chain. The traditional methodology for investigating marine floating debris mainly uses field observations, which are time-consuming, laborious, and constrained in observational scope. Consequently, there is an urgent need for more effective methodologies, such as remote sensing, to monitor marine floating debris, which will be of great significance for enhancing the management of their pollution. In this study, we employ controlled experiments and theoretical model simulations to investigate the spectral characteristics of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(λ)) of two common types of floating plastic debris, specifically polyvinyl chloride (PVC) buoys and polypropylene (PP) bottles. Our analysis reveals distinct Rrs(λ) spectral characteristics for each type of plastic debris, differing significantly from that of the background water. Furthermore, both PVC buoys and PP bottles exhibit a similar absorption valley in the short-wave infrared region, with its depth increasing alongside the plastic coverage. Based on these findings, we develop a novel floating plastic index (FPI) and a corresponding retrieval model for estimating the coverage of floating plastic debris. Validation with simulated data and measurements from control experiments shows good performance of the retrieval model with high inversion accuracy, demonstrated by the values of the coefficient of determination, mean percentage error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error of 0.97, -0.3%, 17.5%, and 3.98%, respectively, for the experimentally measured dataset. Our research provides a theoretical and methodological foundation for remote sensing retrieval of the coverages of floating PVC and PP plastics, as well as offers valuable insights for the analysis of other floating debris types in future studies. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as an atmospheric pollutant. Here, we present a method of estimating MP resuspension with mineral dust in bare soil based on reported MP mass in soils, their enrichment in suspended dust relative to soil, and a mineral dust resuspension scheme. Using the estimated resuspensions, we simulate the global atmospheric MP transport and deposition using the dispersion model FLEXPART for two particle shape scenarios, spheres, and fibers. We estimate the uncertainties using a Monte Carlo technique that varies input data parameters within their reported ranges. The total MP resuspensions are estimated at about 104 (48-110) tonnes yr-1. We find that bare soils in West Asia and North Africa are the main source regions. FLEXPART results show that fibers have higher concentrations in the atmosphere and are dispersed more widely than spheres. Annually, 75 (43-83) tonnes of microfibers are deposited on land and 29 (18-33) tonnes in the oceans. Resuspended MPs can even reach remote regions, such as the Arctic. The results suggest that areas with bare soils can be an important MP source; however, further research on the factors that affect resuspension is needed. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Plastic pollution poses significant challenges in South Asia, exacerbated by rapid urbanization, population growth, and socio-economic disparities. Despite huge efforts being made to address plastic pollution within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, particularly SDG 12 and SDG 14, progress in the region remains slow and uneven. This article critically examines the complexities of the plastic paradox, and discusses both the challenges and opportunities it presents for sustainable development in South Asia, which remains underexplored. We emphasize the need for robust regulatory measures, region-specific technological solutions, and enhanced collaboration to mitigate plastic pollution and advance the SDGs. © 2024 American Chemical Society,\n",
       " Marine microdebris (MD) seem to be widespread in benthic invertebrates, even in the most remote areas of the planet such as Antarctica, although the information available is still very scarce. Here we provide a detailed quantification and characterization of the MD found on three common bivalve species (Aequiyoldia eightsii, Thracia cf. meridionalis, and Cyclocardia astartoides) inhabiting shallow areas in Johnsons’ Bay, Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) as a snapshot of the MD present. On average, these bivalves contained 0.71 ± 0.89 items per individual and 1.49 ± 2.35 items per gram, being comparable to the few previous existing studies in other Antarctic areas. Nearly half of the organisms analysed here (45.6 %), contained at least one item. No significant differences were found in the three bivalve species. As far as we know, this is the first study to analyse and compare MD in three bivalve species in the Antarctic Peninsula. Although our results indicate bivalves are as not as polluted as in other areas of the planet, this is remarkable since this is considered one of the last pristine areas of the world. Our results point to local activities as the main source of MD pollution in Livingston Island, although global pollution cannot be discarded. We believe this research provides a useful baseline for future studies and will contribute to develop policies and strategies to preserve Antarctic marine ecosystems from MD pollution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In the last years biodegradable polymers (BPs) were largely used as real opportunity to solve plastic pollution. Otherwise, their wide use in commercial products, such as packaging sector, is causing a new pollution alarm, mainly because few data reported about their behaviour in the environment and toxicity on marine organisms. Our previous results showed that embryos of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lmk) exposed to poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) showed delay of their development and morphological malformations, also affecting at the molecular levels the expression of several genes involved in different functional responses. In the present work for the first time, we tested the effects of five microplastics (MPs) obtained from BPs such as PBS, poly(butylene succinate), PBSA, poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate), PCL, PHB and PLA, upon grazing activity of the sea urchin revealed by: i. histological analysis seeing at the gonadic tissues; ii. morphological analysis of the deriving embryos; iii. molecular analyses on these embryos to detect variations of the gene expression of eighty-seven genes involved in stress response, detoxification, skeletogenesis, differentiation and development. All these results will help in understanding how MP accumulated inside various organs in the adult sea urchins, and more in general in marine invertebrates, could represent risks for the marine environment. © 2024,\n",
       " Microorganisms quickly colonise microplastics entering the ocean, forming a biofilm that, if ingested, is consumed with the microplastics. Past research often neglects to expose fish to biofouled microplastics, opting only for clean microplastics despite the low likelihood that fish will encounter clean microplastics. Here, we investigate the physiological impacts of biofouled polyethylene microplastic (300–335 μm) exposure in juvenile fish. Intermittent flow respirometry, antioxidant enzyme activity, and lipid peroxidation were investigated after fish were exposed to clean, biofouled, or no microplastic beads. Fish exposed to biofouled microplastics had a wider aerobic scope than those exposed to clean microplastics while antioxidant enzyme and lipid peroxidation levels were higher in clean microplastics. Clean microplastic exposure indicated higher fitness costs, potentially due to a nutritional advantage of the biofilm or varying bioavailability. These findings highlight the importance of replicating natural factors in exposure experiments when predicting the impacts of increasing pollutants in marine systems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In recent years, microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a significant environmental pollutant, garnering substantial attention for their migration and transformation behaviors in natural environments. MPs frequently infiltrate natural porous media such as soil, sediment, and rock through various pathways, posing potential threats to ecological systems and human health. Consequently, the migration and adsorption mechanisms applied to MPs in porous media have been extensively studied. This paper aims to elucidate the migration mechanisms of MPs in porous media and their influencing factors through a systematic review. The review encompasses the characteristics of MPs, the physical properties of porous media, and hydrodynamic factors. Additionally, the paper further clarifies the adsorption mechanisms of MPs in porous media to provide theoretical support for understanding their environmental behavior and fate. Furthermore, the current mainstream detection techniques for MPs are reviewed, with an analysis of the advantages, disadvantages, and applications of each technique. Finally, the paper identifies the limitations and shortcomings of current research and envisions future research directions. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Concerns regarding microplastic (MP) contamination in aquatic ecosystems and its impact on seafood require a better understanding of human dietary MP exposure including extensive monitoring. While conventional techniques for MP analysis like infrared or Raman microspectroscopy provide detailed particle information, they are limited by low sample throughput, particularly when dealing with high particle numbers in seafood due to matrix-related residues. Consequently, more rapid techniques need to be developed to meet the requirements of large-scale monitoring. This study focused on semi-automated fluorescence imaging analysis after Nile red staining for rapid MP screening in seafood. By implementing RGB-based fluorescence threshold values, the need for high operator expertise to prevent misclassification was addressed. Food-relevant MP was identified with over 95% probability and differentiated from natural polymers with a 1% error rate. Comparison with laser direct infrared imaging (LDIR), a state-of-the-art method for rapid MP analysis, showed similar particle counts, indicating plausible results. However, highly variable recovery rates attributed to inhomogeneous particle spiking experiments highlight the need for future development of certified reference material including sample preparation. The proposed method demonstrated suitability of high throughput analysis for seafood samples, requiring 0.02–0.06 h/cm2 filter surface compared to 4.5–14.7 h/cm with LDIR analysis. Overall, the method holds promise as a screening tool for more accurate yet resource-intensive MP analysis methods such as spectroscopic or thermoanalytical techniques.

       " Microorganisms, including potential pathogens, can colonise plastic surfaces in aquatic environments. This study investigates the colonisation of plastic pellets by Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a proxy for faecal pathogens in aquatic environments. Plastic pellets from a polluted beach were placed in seawater aquaria spiked with E. coli. Diverse bacteria, primarily from the Proteobacteria phylum, rapidly colonised the pellets within 24 h, with notable species known for plastic or hydrocarbon degradation. Over 26 days, biofilms formed on the plastic surfaces, reaching bacterial populations of up to 6.8·105 gene copies (gc) of the 16S rRNA mm−2. E. coli, was detected in the pellets for up to 7 days using culture methods, exhibiting varying attachment densities regardless of source or environmental factors. The study highlights plastic biofilms as reservoirs for E. coli, contributing to the survival and persistence of faecal bacteria in aquatic systems. These findings deepen our understanding of the risks associated with plastic pollution in marine settings, offering insights into the behaviour of faecal indicators and their implications for water quality assessments, while providing valuable information on potential pathogen dissemination within plastic-associated microbial communities. © 2024 The Author(s).

       " Microplastics could be ingested by many organisms, including zooplankton, involving bioaccumulation and biomagnification mechanisms a cross food webs. The information about microplastic ingestion by zooplankton keeps increasing worldwide. However, it is still limited for particle sizes under 300 μm (small microplastics, SMPs) and in areas such as Southeast Asia, which is considered one of the hotspots for plastic debris. This study aimed to characterize the size, shape, and polymer types of the SMPs ingested by the copepod Centropages furcatus in Si Chang Island (upper Gulf of Thailand). The study spans offshore and coastal waters, with data collected across wet, intermediate, and dry seasons. Using a semi-automated technique for micro-FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) scanning spectroscopy for particle analysis, we found ingested SMPs in all samples. A total of 750 individuals of the calanoid Centropages furcatus were analyzed, finding 309 plastic particles and an average ingestion value of 0.41 ± 0.13 particles ind−1, one of the highest recorded values. All the particles were fragments, with a predominant size under 50 μm, and polymer types as Polypropylene (PP, 71 %), followed by Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM, 16 %) and Polyethylene (PE, 7 %). Up to 470.2 particles m−3 were estimated to be retained by this calanoid species and potentially available for trophic transfer. The effect of rainfall on SMPs ingestion was inconclusive, with a non-significant observed tendency to higher ingestion values near the coastal area than offshore area, suggesting a decrease in particle exposure due to the runoff effect. Nevertheless, future studies should increase the frequency of surveys to arrive at better conclusions. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastic pollution has spread through all parts of the marine environment, representing a significant threat to species and ecosystems. This study investigates the role of copepods as widespread microplastic reservoirs in the marine environment, by performing, a systematic review, meta-analysis, and semiquantitative analysis of scientific articles focusing on the interaction between copepods and microplastics under field conditions. Our findings indicate that despite uniformly low ingestion of microplastics across different marine layers and geographical areas, with a slight uptake in neustonic copepods, copepods might constitute one of the largest marine microplastic reservoirs. This phenomenon is attributed more to their vast abundance than to average microplastic ingestion values. In this article, a framework for data analysis and reporting is proposed to facilitate future large-scale evaluations and modelling of their extent and impact on plastic and carbon cycles. These insights place copepods at the forefront of the marine plastic cycle, possibly affecting plastic distribution, and bioavailability, thereby opening new pathways for understanding the complex dynamics of microplastics in marine ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) can enter the atmosphere via sea spray aerosols (SSAs), but the effects of plastic characteristics on the aerosolization process are unclear. Furthermore, the importance of the transport of MNPs via these SSAs as a possible new exposure route for human health remains unknown. The aim of this study was two-fold: (1) to examine if a selection of factors affects aerosolization processes of MNPs, and (2) to estimate human exposure to MNPs via aerosols inhalation. A laboratory-based bubble bursting mechanism, simulating the aerosolization process at sea, was used to investigate the influence of MNP as well as seawater characteristics. To determine the potential human exposure to microplastics via inhalation of SSAs, the results of the laboratory experiments were extrapolated to the field based on sea surface microplastic concentrations and the volume of inhaled aerosols. Enrichment seemed to be influenced by MNP size, concentration and polymer type. With higher enrichment for smaller particles and denser polymers. Experiments with different concentrations showed a larger range of variability but nonetheless lower concentrations seemed to result in higher enrichment, presumably due to lower aggregation. In addition to the MNP characteristics, the type of seawater used seemed to influence the aerosolization process. Our human exposure estimate to microplastic via inhalation of sea spray aerosols shows that in comparison with reported inhaled concentrations in urban and indoor environments, this exposure route seems negligible for microplastics. Following the business-as-usual scenario on plastic production, the daily plastic inhalation in coastal areas in 2100 is estimated to increase but remain far below 1 particle per day. This study shows that aerosolization of MNPs is a new plastic transport pathway to be considered, but in terms of human exposure it seems negligible compared to other more important sources of MNPs, based on current reported environmental concentrations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study provides new insights onto spatial and temporal trends of seafloor macro-litter in the abyssal seafloor of Sardinian channel, in central western Mediterranean (Italy). Trawl surveys were conducted at depths between 884 and 1528 m, thus focusing on one of the least investigated marine environments. None of the considered sites was litter free, with plastics being numerically dominant (57% of items), followed by metal (11%) and glass (16%). Recorded densities and weight ranged between 49.9 and 499 items km−2 and 1.4 and 1052 kg km−2. In the most contaminated sites, the weight of the litter collected in nets represented up to nine times the biomass of benthic megafauna, and, overall, in 60% of hauls macro-litter mass outweighed the biomass collected. Moreover, we report that megafauna was observed to be more abundant in sites where macro-litter presence was more severe. More studies are needed to elucidate the nature of this correlation, with biota being more abundant in hotspots of accumulation of seafloor macro-litter. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Coastal ecosystems have ecological importance worldwide and require control and prevention measures to mitigate human pollution. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review to provide a comprehensive overview of the global issue of coastal plastic pollution. 689 articles were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 31 were considered for quantitative analysis. There was an exponential increase in articles addressing coastal plastic pollution over the past 50 years. Studies were mainly carried out on beaches, and plastic bottles were the most found item, followed by cigarette butts. Polyethylene was the predominant plastic polymer, and white microplastic fragments stood out. China published most articles on the topic and Brazil had the highest number of sites sampled.

       " Microplastics (MPs) are emerging contaminants of increasing concern as they may cause adverse effects and carry other contaminants, which may potentially compromise human health. Despite occurring in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, the knowledge about MP presence in different aquaculture systems and their potential impact on seafood products is still limited. This study aimed to determine the levels of MPs in water, feed, and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) from three relevant aquaculture systems and estimate human exposure to MPs and metals through seabass consumption. The recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) had the highest MP occurrence in water and feed. MP levels in seabass followed the aquaculture system's levels in water and feed, with RAS-farmed fish presenting the highest MP load, both in the fish gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and muscle, followed by pond-, and cage-farmed fish. MPs' characteristics across aquaculture systems and fish samples remained consistent, with the predominant recovered particles falling within the MP size range. The particles were visually characterized and chemically identified by micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (μFTIR). Most of these particles were fibres composed of man-made cellulose and PET. MP levels in GIT were significantly higher than in muscle for pond- and RAS-farmed fish, MPs' bioconcentration factors >1 indicated bioconcentration in farmed seabass. Metal concentrations in fish muscle were below permissible limits, posing low intake risks for consumers according to the available health-based guidance values and estimated dietary scenarios. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Few methods exist detailing the extraction of microplastics from organic matrices. A validated method for the successful extraction of microplastics from solid biowastes including biosolids, compost, and soil for spectroscopic analysis by micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (µ-FTIR) was developed. Solid dry biowastes were first digested with a wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) with iron (II) solution and 30% hydrogen peroxide followed by sequential density separations with ultra-pure water and 1.8 g cm−3 NaI in an optimised sediment-microplastic isolation (SMI) unit. The average recoveries for spiked microplastics were 92, 95 and 98% for bagged compost, biosolids, and soil, respectively. This method ensures a high microplastic recovery by first chemically disintegrating biowaste aggregates without employing destructive methods like milling and allows for successful density separations where the settled fraction is isolated off from the supernatant, allowing thorough rinsing of the equipment and thus a greater transferal of particles into the vacuum filtering device. Minimal processing steps reduce the instance of introducing contamination and particle loss. • Digestion as a first step to disintegrate aggregates to release entrapped microplastics • Density separation with SMI unit with the method adapted for biowastes • Minimal steps to reduce contamination and particle loss © 2024,\n",
       " The properties of microplastics determine their settling velocities and affect the fates and migration pathways of microplastics. This paper has simulated the settling velocities of film–shaped microplastics, which are present in natural aquatic environments. The numerical results provided more data to fit the terminal settling velocities of film–shaped microplastics. Comparison between the particle definition and the equivalent spherical diameter confirmed that the particle definition is more suitable for film–shaped microplastics. In the transitional flow regime, CD decreases linearly with Re. As Re further increases, CD gradually converges at approximately 1.20. By integrating the experimental and simulated data, a new explicit formula for predicting the settling velocity of film–shaped microplastics has been presented with the optimal shape parameter f. The presented formula achieves better performance (MAPE = 6.6 %, RMSE = 16.8 %, and R2 = 0.99) than the existing formulas for settling velocity for film–shaped microplastics, closely rivaling that of the ensemble learning algorithm. © 2024,\n",
       " Remote islands are disproportionately affected by plastic pollution, often originating from elsewhere, so it is important to understand its origins, to stop debris entering the ocean at their source. We investigated the origins of beached plastic drink bottles in the Chagos Archipelago, a large remote Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Indian Ocean. We recorded the brands, countries of manufacture, types of drink, and ages of plastic bottles and their lids. The prevalent type of drink was water, with items mostly manufactured in Indonesia, China, and the Maldives. The main brands were Danone and the Coca-Cola Company. We deduced that 10 % of the items originated from ships passing the archipelago, including all the items manufactured in China. The identification of the brands creating plastic pollution in remote MPAs with high biodiversity supports extended producer responsibility, one of the proposed policy development areas of the Global Plastics Treaty. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution is widely spread in oceans, freshwater, and terrestrial environments but MPs in mountainous headwater ecosystem are rarely reported. This study focuses on the headwater of Yangtze tributaries of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region. Five streams at elevations of 900 to 3300 m were selected to investigate the distribution of MPs in water and sediments across altitudes. MPs were found in all water and sediment samples from top stream zone nearly in absence of anthropogenic activity, low anthropogenic zone, and high anthropogenic zone, increased from 12–54, 81–185 to 334–847 items/L, and 2–35, 26–84 to 124–428 items/kg, respectively. This elevation-dependent MP distribution indicated that as elevation decreased, anthropogenic activities intensified and increased MPs input and their abundance, size, and diversity. Notably, hydraulic projects, such as damming, were identified as potential barriers to the migration of MPs downstream. Microbiome analyses revealed the presence of bacterial genes associated with plastic biodegradation in all sediment samples. The study indicates that Shangri-la mountainous streams have been polluted with MPs for years with potential risk of generation of nano-sized particles via natural fragmentation and biodegradation, and thus raises concern on MPs pollution in headwaters streams in mountainous regions. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic debris in the ocean releases chemical compounds that can be toxic to marine fauna. It was recently found that some marine bacteria can degrade such leachates, but information on the diversity of these bacteria is mostly lacking. In this study, we analysed the bacterial diversity growing on leachates from new low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a mix of naturally weathered plastic, collected from beach sand. We used a combination of Catalysed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH), BioOrthogonal Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT), and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyse bacterioplankton-groups specific activity responses and the identity of the responsive taxa to plastic leachates produced under irradiated and non-irradiated conditions. We found that some generalist taxa responded to all leachates, most of them belonging to the Alteromonadales, Oceanospirillales, Nitrosococcales, Rhodobacterales, and Sphingomonadales orders. However, there were also non-generalist taxa responding to specific irradiated and non-irradiated leachates. Our results provide information about bacterial taxa that could be potentially used to degrade the chemicals released during plastic degradation into seawater contributing to its bioremediation. © 2024 The Author(s).

       " In recent years, plastic pollution in the environment has also increased due to the increasing production and consumption of plastics worldwide. The presence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment from different sources is observed almost everywhere, especially in aquatic environments. A standard method for sampling, identification, and quantification of MPs in wastewater has not yet been established. In this study, it was aimed to determine the MPs and their characteristics in the effluent of an advanced biological domestic wastewater treatment plant. The seasonal changes of MPs in a year were revealed. Pre-treatments suitable for the studied wastewater were developed for visual determination of MPs. Fibers are the dominant type of MPs, with numbers ranging between 32.0 and 95.5 particle/L. MPs in five different polymer structures were determined by FTIR analysis. These are Polyethylene, Polypropylene, Polyester, Polyurethane and Polyethylene terephthalate. The results were evaluated according to QA/QC and determined to meet the standards. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " A comprehensive analysis of municipal solid plastic waste (MSPW) management while emphasizing plastic pollution severity in coastal cities around the world is mandatory to alleviate the augmenting plastic waste footprint in nature. Thus, decision-makers’ persuasion for numerous management solutions of MSPW flow-control can be met through meditative systematic strategies at the regional level. To forecast solutions focused on systematic policies, an agent-based system dynamics (ASD) model has been developed and simulated from 2023 to 2040 while considering significant knit parameters for MSPW management of Khulna City in Bangladesh. Baseline simulation results show that per-capita plastic waste generation will increase to 11.6 kg by 2040 from 8.92 kg in 2023. Eventually, the landfilled quantity of plastic waste has accumulated to 70,000 tons within 18 years. Moreover, the riverine discharge has increased to 834 tons in 2040 from a baseline quantity of 512 tons in 2023. So the plastic waste footprint index (PWFI) value rises to 24 by 2040. Furthermore, the absence of technological initiatives is responsible for the logarithmic rise of non-recyclable plastic waste to 1.35*1000=1350 tons. Finally, two consecutive policy scenarios with baseline factors such as controlled riverine discharge, increased collection and separation of plastic waste, expansion of recycle business, and locally achievable plastic conversion technologies have been simulated. Therefore, policy 2, with 69% conversion, 80% source separation, and 50% riverine discharge reduction of MSPW, has been found adequate from a sustainability perspective with the lowest PWFI ranges of 3.97 to 1.07 alongside a per-capita MSPW generation of 7.63 to 10 kg from 2023 till 2040.

       " This overview presents comparison of common microtechnofossils with other geochemical markers that may have the great potential to be the anthropogenic signatures for recent and future sediment strata. The novel man-made products encompass spherical and spheroidal fly-ash particulates, microplastics, synthetic crystals, and more recently examined glass microspheres. Due to their low specific gravity and small size varying from a tiny fraction of millimeter to approximately 5 mm, microtechnofossils may be transported over a long distance from their primary or secondary sources by water and wind. Of these technogenic materials, among the most resistant to physical and chemical degradation are glass microbeads, and additionally synthetic crystals and some types of fly-ash particulates derived mostly from coal/oil combustion, metal ore smelting operations and cement/lime manufacturing. Nonetheless, synthetic glass microspheres have found exponentially growing applications as reflective ingredients in traffic-related paints and building facades, as well as in a variety of applications mostly as low-density fillers of many materials. In contrast to anthropogenic fly-ash and microplastic particles, glass microspheres resemble in many respects common detrital quartz grains. Moreover, like quartz, they are resistant to depositional and diagenetic processes, which is a prerequisite for future geologic archives preserving anthropogenic signals. These and other characteristics make glass microspheres a more widely used product in various fields thus assigning them to a new emerging and globally spreading chronostratigraphic marker of human-impacted sediments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The ecological health of freshwater rivers is deteriorating globally due to careless human activities, for instance, the emission of plastic garbage into the river. The current research was the first assessment of microplastics (MPs) pollution in water, sediment, and representative organisms (fish, crustacean, and bivalve) from the Surma River. Water, sediment, and organisms were sampled from six river sites (Site 1: Charkhai; Site 2: Golapganj; Site 3: Alampur; Site 4: Kazir Bazar; Site 5: Kanishail and Site 6: Lamakazi), and major water quality parameters were recorded during sampling. Thereafter, MPs in water, sediment, and organism samples were extracted, and then microscopically examined to categorize selected MPs types. The abundance of MPs, as well as size, and color distribution, were estimated. Polymer types were analyzed by ATR-FTIR, the color loss of MPs was recorded, the Pollution Load Index (PLI) was calculated, and the relationship between MPs and water quality parameters was analyzed. Sites 4 and 5 had comparatively poorer water quality than other sites. Microplastic fibers, fragments, and microbeads were consistently observed in water, sediment, and organisms. A substantial range of MPs in water, sediment, and organisms (37.33–686.67 items/L, 0.89–15.12 items/g, and 0.66–48.93 items/g, respectively) was recorded. There was a diverse color range, and MPs of <200 μm were prevalent in sampling areas. Six polymer types were identified by ATR-FTIR, namely Polyethylene (PE), Polyamide (PA), Polypropylene (PP), Cellulose acetate (CA), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and Polystyrene (PS), where PE (41%) was recognized as highly abundant. The highest PLI was documented in Site 4 followed by Site 5 both in water and sediment. Likewise, Sites 4 and 5 were substantially different from other study areas according to PCA. Overall, the pervasiveness of MPs was evident in the Surma River, which requires further attention and prompt actions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Human activity has led to microplastic contamination throughout the marine environment. As a result of widespread contamination, microplastics are ingested by many species of wildlife, including fish, cephalopods, and shellfish. Taiwan is surrounded by oceans that offer a rich range of seafood. Taiwanese residents can easily acquire seafood as a source of dietary protein. A recent research project by Greenpeace shows that the Taiwanese eat 16,000 microplastic particles per year. There is concern regarding microplastic physical and chemical toxicity, which poses potential health risks to the local community via food chains. Thus, monitoring microplastic contamination in seafood is imperative to provide helpful information for the government and local communities. Efforts should be taken to reduce microplastic pollution at the source to minimize potential effects on ecological and health safety. This review article emphasizes the urgent need for further research on microplastic pollution in Taiwan, highlights the potential challenges to mitigate this emerging environmental threat, and analyzes food safety hazards as well as microplastic contamination in seafood. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has caused severe concern due to its harmful effect on human beings and ecosystems. Existing MP removal methods face many obstacles, such as high cost, high energy consumption, low efficiency, release of toxic chemicals, etc. Thus, it is crucial to find appropriate and sustainable methods to replace common MP removal approaches. Bio-electrochemical system (BES) is a sustainable clean energy technology that has been successfully applied to wastewater treatment, seawater desalination, metal removal, energy production, biosensors, etc. However, research reports on BES technology to eliminate MP pollution are limited. This paper reviews the mechanism, hazards, and common treatment methods of MP removal and discusses the application of BES systems to improve MP removal efficiency and sustainability. Firstly, the characteristics and limitations of common MP removal techniques are systematically summarized. Then, the potential application of BES technology in MP removal is explored. Furthermore, the feasibility and stability of the potential BES MP removal application are critically evalauted while recommendations for further research are proposed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic biofilms are novel vectors for the transport and spread of pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria. With the increasing use of bio-based plastics, there is an urgent need to investigate the microbial colonization characteristics of these materials in seawater, particularly in comparison with conventional petroleum-based plastics. Furthermore, the effect of co-occurring contaminants, such as heavy metals, on the formation of microplastic biofilms and bacterial communities remains unclear. In this study, we compared the biofilm bacterial community structure of petroleum-based polyethylene (PE) and bio-based polylactic acid (PLA) in seawater under the influence of zinc ions (Zn2+). Our findings indicate that the biofilm on PLA microplastics in the late stage was impeded by the formation of a mildly acidic microenvironment resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester group on PLA. The PE surface had higher bacterial abundance and diversity, with a more intricate symbiotic pattern. The bacterial structures on the two types of microplastics were different; PE was more conducive to the colonization of anaerobic bacteria, whereas PLA was more favorable for the colonization of aerobic and acid-tolerant species. Furthermore, Zn increased the proportion of the dominant genera that could utilize microplastics as a carbon source, such as Alcanivorax and Nitratireductor. PLA had a greater propensity to harbor and disseminate pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria, and Zn promoted the enrichment and spread of harmful bacteria such as, Pseudomonas and Clostridioides. Therefore, further research is essential to fully understand the potential environmental effects of bio-based microplastics and the role of heavy metals in the dynamics of bacterial colonization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) conduces massive environmental accumulation due to its high production and recalcitrance to environment. In this study, We successfully enriched and isolated two strains, Nitratireductor sp. Z-1 and Gordonia sp. Z-2, from coastal plastic debris capable of degrading LDPE film. After a 30-day incubation at 30 ℃, strains Z-1 and Z-2 decreased the weight of branched-LDPE (BLDPE) film by 2.59 % and 10.27 % respectively. Furthermore, high temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) analysis revealed molecular weight reductions of 7.69 % (Z-1) and 23.22 % (Z-2) in the BLDPE film. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image showed the presence of microbial colonization and perforations on the film's surface. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated novel functional groups, such as carbonyl and carbon-carbon double bonds in LDPE films. During LDPE degradation, both strains produced extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). GC-MS analysis revealed the degradation products included short-chain alkanes, alkanols, fatty acids, and esters. Genomic analysis identified numerous extracellular enzymes potentially involved in LDPE chain scission. A model was proposed suggesting a coordinated role between ROS and extracellular enzymes in the biodegradation of LDPE. This indicates strains Z-1 and Z-2 can degrade LDPE, providing a basis for deeper exploration of biodegradation mechanisms. © 2024,\n",
       " This study investigates the occurrence and characteristics of macroplastic and polymer microparticles in the Urias coastal lagoon’s beach sediments, in northwest Mexico. Coastal lagoons, productive and vulnerable ecosystems, are impacted significantly by anthropogenic activities, leadings to their pollution by various contaminants, including plastics. Our research involved sampling sediments from four sites within the lagoon that were influenced by different human activities such as fishing, aquaculture, thermoelectric power plant operations, industrial operations, and domestic wastewater discharge. Our methodology included collecting macroplastics and beach sediment samples, followed by laboratory analyses to identify the plastic debris’ size, shape, color, and chemical composition. The results indicated a notable presence of macroplastic items (144), predominantly bags, styrofoam, and caps made of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The polymer microparticles were mainly fibers, with cotton and polyester as the most common polymers, suggesting a significant contribution from clothing-related waste. The dominant colors of the microparticles were blue and transparent. High densities were observed in areas with slower water exchange. Our findings highlight the urgent need for better waste management practices to mitigate plastic pollution in coastal lagoons, preserving their ecological and economic functions. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " We assessed microplastic (μP) pollution in water and sediment samples during the dry and rainy season (October/2018 and March/2019, respectively) from the Guarapiranga Reservoir in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, Brazil, which provides drinking water for up to 5.2 million people. The concentration of mPs varied spatially and seasonally, with the higher concentrations observed near the urbanized areas and during the dry season. Water column concentrations ranged from 150 to 3100 particles/m3 and 0.07–25.05 mm3 plastic/m3 water during the dry season, and 70–7900 particles/m3 and 0.06–4.57 mm3 plastic/m3 water during the rainy season. Sediment samples were collected only during the rainy season, with concentrations ranging from 210 to 22,999 particles/kg dry weight and 0.15–111.46 mm3/kg dry weight. The particle size distribution exhibited seasonal variation, with μPs >1 mm predominating during the dry season, constituting 60–75% of all particles. In terms of quantity, fibers accounted for the majority of microplastics, comprising 55–95% during the dry season and 70–92% during the rainy season. However, when considering particle volume, irregular particles dominated in some samples, accounting for up to 95% of the total amount. The predominant colors of microplastics were white/crystal, black, and blue, with the main compositions identified as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), suggesting the influence of untreated domestic sewage discharge. Additionally, some additives were detected, including the pigments Fast RED ITR and phthalocyanine blue. The management of reservoir water levels appears to influence the quantity of μPs in the water column. As the water level increases up to 90% of the reservoir capacity during the rainy season, the amount of μPs in the water decreases, despite the higher influx of particles resulting from surface runoff caused by rainy conditions. This suggests a “dilution” effect combined to the polymictic mixing hydrodynamics. Our results may contribute to the creation and improvement of monitoring programs regarding mP pollution and to the adoption of specific public policies, which are still lacking in legislation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " The increase of micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) in aquatic environments has become a significant concern due to their potential toxicological effects on ecosystems, food web dynamics, and human health. These plastic particles emerge from a range of sources, such as the breakdown of larger plastic waste, consumer products, and industrial outputs. This review provides a detailed report of the transmission and dangers of MNPs in aquatic ecosystems, environmental behavior, and interactions within aquatic food webs, emphasizing their toxic impact on marine life. It explores the relationship between particle size and toxicity, their distribution in different tissues, and the process of trophic transfer through the food web. MNPs, once consumed, can be found in various organs, including the digestive system, gills, and liver. Their consumption by lower trophic level organisms facilitates their progression up the food chain, potentially leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification, thereby posing substantial risks to the health, reproduction, and behavior of aquatic species. This work also explores how MNPs, through their persistence and bioaccumulation, pose risks to aquatic biodiversity and disrupt trophic relationships. The review also addresses the implications of MNPs for human health, particularly through the consumption of contaminated seafood, highlighting the direct and indirect pathways through which humans are exposed to these pollutants. Furthermore, the review highlights the recommendations for future research directions, emphasizing the integration of ecological, toxicological, and human health studies to inform risk assessments and develop mitigation strategies to address the global challenge of plastic pollution in aquatic environments. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The prevalence of plastics in the oceans has significantly intensified microplastic pollution, contributing to broader marine secondary pollution issues. This paper examines how plastic structure affects the aging characteristics of plastics and the release of metal ions, to better understand this secondary source of marine pollution. This study simulate the photoaging of plastics in natural environments, focusing on aliphatic and aromatic polymers. The results showed that the photodegradation degree was higher for aliphatic than aromatic polymers. All polymers contained thirteen detectable metals, with their release increasing over time due to photoaging, The release dynamics of these metal ions correlated more strongly with the level of polymer degradation rather than with the polymer structure itself, adhering to a second-order kinetic model driven by surface and intraparticle diffusion processes. The results will help control and treat marine plastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution endangers both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Their spread across the food chain also endangers human health. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be viewed as the final barrier between microplastics and the environment. In addition, it is well-known that water mites are abundant parasites in aquatic ecosystems, and nearly all insect orders with aquatic stages are considered potential hosts for at least one water mite species. However, no studies have been conducted to test the direct and indirect effects of parasites on population dynamics in freshwater ecosystems or the role of predators in shaping the behavior and life histories of aquatic organisms. Thus, this work aimed to study the seasonal abundance, distribution, composition, and risk assessment of MPs in surface water, aquatic insects (Coroxide and Notonectidae), and for the first time, water mites (Hydrachnidiae), as well as the effect of water mites’ parasitism on the number of MPs ingested by aquatic insects in two of the most polluted wastewater sites (S1 and S2) in Sohag Governorate, Egypt. The two wastewater sites receive different wastewater inputs (domestic and industrial). The results showed that the MPs abundance in surface water was higher in S2 than in S1 during the four seasons of the year, where the microplastic abundance in surface water was 2.05 ± 0.79 and 3.01 ± 0.9 particles/L in S1 and S2, respectively. Also, MPs were significantly higher in S2 in two insect taxa (Corixidae and Notonectidae) that are known to be infected by water mites. In contrast, the number of MPs was lower in S1, where water mites were absent. In addition, our results showed that adult water mites accumulated MPs. Overall, the 500–2000 µm size range was the most prevalent for both wastewater sites. Fibers were the most common MP morphotype discovered, followed by fragments. The dominant colors of MP were blue, red, and black. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy revealed the existence of three distinct polymers, namely polyester (PES), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of water mites’ parasitism on the number of MPs ingested by aquatic organisms. However, Further research is needed to confirm our suggestion. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics are a growing concern in mangrove ecosystems; however, their effects on archaeal communities and related ecological processes remain unclear. We conducted in situ biofilm-enrichment experiments to investigate the ecological influence of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene microplastics on archaeal communities in the sediments of mangrove ecosystems. The archaeal community present on microplastics was distinct from that of the surrounding sediments at an early stage but became increasingly similar over time. Bathyarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Asgardaeota were the most abundant phyla. Methanolobus, an archaeal biomarker, was enriched in PE biofilms, and significantly controlled by homogeneous selection in the plastisphere, indicating an increased potential risk of methane emission. The dominant archaeal assembly process in the sediments was deterministic (58.85%−70.47%), while that of the PE biofilm changed from stochastic to deterministic during the experiment. The network of PE plastispheres showed less complexity and competitive links, and higher modularity and stability than that of sediments. Functional prediction showed an increase in aerobic ammonia oxidation during the experiment, whereas methanogenesis and chemoheterotrophy were significantly higher in the plastisphere. This study provides novel insights into the impact of microplastic pollution on archaeal communities and their mediating ecological functions in mangrove ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Purpose: Marine plastic pollution (MPP) is increasing in recent times because of the high usage of plastic products. Green consumption behaviour (GCB) gaining attention as effective approach to achieving sustainable source reduction of plastic pollution, which negatively affects both human pollution and marine biodiversity and ecosystem. Although, Higher Education (HE) students are key stakeholders in addressing environmental issues, including MPP, there is limited empirical research in Ghana on factors influencing HE students’ GCB. This study, in an endeavour to bridge the gap, used the revised theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework to investigate the factors influencing higher-education students’ green consumption behaviour in the Ghanaian context. Specifically, the purpose of the study is to examine the interplay of consumer novelty seeking (CNS), environmental concern (EC), perceived behavioural control and social influence on green consumption behaviour among higher-education students in Ghana. The study also explored the moderating role of gender in the relationship between CNS and green consumption behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: This study used quantitative approach to obtain data from a sample of 233 students at the University of Cape Coast and used the partial least squares structural equation modelling approach for the data analysis. Findings: The findings provide valuable insights, highlighting the important role of CNS and ECs in driving higher education students’ green consumption behaviour in Ghana. This study also found a revealing role for gender as a moderator in the relationship between CNS and green consumption behaviour, with females exhibiting a more pronounced response to CNS in influencing green consumption behaviour. On the contrary, the authors found a non-significant impact of perceived behavioural control and social influence. Research limitations/implications: Although this study presents results that provide valuable insights for policy and practical implications, it has some limitations worth mentioning for future research directions. Firstly, the participants sampled for this study comprised only higher education students from the University of Cape Coast in Ghana, which may limit the applicability of the findings to other student populations at various universities in Ghana and beyond. Moreover, the exclusion of non-students who are considered as “Generation Z” (i.e. born within 1995–2010) may narrow the scope of generalisability in the context of young consumers’ green consumption behaviour in Ghana. To enhance the generalisability of future studies, it is recommended that the scope of this study be extended. Furthermore, it should be noted that this study primarily measured higher education students’ green consumption behaviour based on self-reported data. Therefore, future research could adopt alternative approaches, such as non-self-reported measures or experimental data so to reduce the complexities and the gap that may exist between attitudes and behaviour. Practical implications: These results provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators and environmental advocates to develop targeted initiatives that resonate with Ghanaian higher education students to foster green consumption practices and contribute to global efforts against marine plastic pollution. Originality/value: The novelty of this study lies in the decision to propose a TPB model by including variables like CNS and EC that are believed to positively shape attitudes towards green consumption behaviour. The rationale for examining these variables is grounded in the belief that they are appropriate factors that may predict students’ green consumer behaviour, which may serve as a potential solution to marine plastic pollution. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.,\n",
       " This study presents the most extensive investigation of microplastic (MP) contents in sediment from the Elbe River. We employed electrostatic separation (ES) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to overcome limitations of sample throughput and time-consuming analysis. In total 43 sediment samples were collected using a Van-Veen grab. Subsequently, coarse materials (d10 > 100 μm) and fine materials (d10 ≤ 100 μm) were enriched using ES and density separation. DSC was utilized for MP identification and quantification, based on the phase-transition signals of eight different polymers. MP presence was detected in 25 samples, with successful quantification in 12 samples. The MP content in coarse material samples from shoreline areas ranged from 0.52 to 1.30 mg/kg, while in fine material samples from harbor basins, it ranged from 5.0 to 44.6 mg/kg. The most prevalent polymers identified were LD-PE, HD-PE, PP, and PCL. These findings confirmed the suitability of DSC for analyzing MP in complex environmental samples. MP hotspots were identified in harbor basins, where natural sedimentation processes and increased anthropogenic activities contribute to MP accumulation. Additionally, industrial sewage potentially contributed to MP content in sediment samples. The highest pollution levels were observed in the middle Elbe, between the confluences of Mulde and Havel. Lowest MP contents were found in the lower Elbe, potentially influenced by tides. Future studies should focus on holistic investigations of selected river sections, encompassing sediment, water, and biota samples, rather than the entire catchment area. This approach would facilitate the generation of spatiotemporal data on MP distribution in freshwater streams. In addition, more research is needed to explore potential interactions between different MP and sediment types during DSC measurements. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " We investigated the occurrence of microplastics (MPs), a burgeoning environmental pollutant, in three drinking water supplying reservoirs situated in Ranchi, India.Through comprehensive water and sediment samples analysis, the study attempted to evaluate spatial distribution, conduct morphological examinations, perform polymeric analysis, and conduct source apportionment to pinpoint significant contributors. Morphological examinations were conducted utilizing a stereomicroscope equipped with a fluorescence adapter, while polymeric composition analysis was done on FTIR. Additionally, various indices, such as the MP Diversity Index and Pollution Load Index, were calculated alongside other statistical analyses. The findings revealed the omnipresence of MP particles- fragments, films, fibers, and foams—in all 180 water samples (total count: 3699—6873) and 144 sediment samples (total count: 1038—5166) at notably high concentrations. Eight polymer types could be identified from the FTIR analysis, with PET and HDPE dominance. ANOVA analysis indicated significant sediment differences among the reservoirs, although regression analysis did not show substantial particle settling from surface water to sediment. The MP Pollution Load Index classified two reservoirs as high-risk (Hazard level II). Finally, a source apportionment study based on the potential source items, their categories, relative score, and individual contributory score suggested single-use plastic items and household plastic items to be the major contributor to the MP contamination in these reservoirs.This source apportionment-driven model holds promise for addressing MP contamination in lakes and reservoirs worldwide, facilitating the identification of major contributing factors and informing stakeholders to develop policies in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6 and SDG 14) for clean water systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic contaminants that have been found in marine ecosystems. This review aims to explore the sources and mechanisms of PAHs and MPs mixed contamination in marine environments. Understanding the released sources of PAHs and MPs is crucial for proposing appropriate regulations on the release of these contaminants. Additionally, the mechanisms of co-occurrence and the role of MPs in distributing PAHs in marine ecosystems were investigated in detail. Moreover, the chemical affinity between PAHs and MPs was proposed, highlighting the potential mechanisms that lead to their persistence in marine ecosystems. Moreover, we delve into the various factors influencing the co-occurrence, chemical affinity, and distribution of mixed contaminants in marine ecosystems. These factors, including environmental characteristics, MPs properties, PAHs molecular weight and hydrophobicity, and microbial interactions, were critically examined. The co-contamination raises concerns about the potential synergistic effects on their degradation and toxicity. Interesting, few studies have reported the enhanced photodegradation and biodegradation of contaminants under mixed contamination compared to their individual remediation. However, currently, the remediation strategies reported for PAHs and MPs mixed contamination are scarce and limited. While there have been some initiatives to remove PAHs and MPs individually, there is a lack of research specifically targeting the removal of mixed contaminants. This deficiency highlights the need for further investigation and the development of effective remediation approaches for the efficient remediation of PAHs and MPs from marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastics are non-biodegradable products that cause serious environmental and fiscal problems. When plastic debris is not repurposed, it ends up in dumps, and the ocean refuses areas or is burned, creating various environmental issues. If pollution from incineration plants is managed, the plant becomes so costly that not all nations can afford it. To increase the resilience of roadways, plastic refuse is now used in their building alongside bitumen.

       " The ubiquitous presence of micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) in the environment poses high potential risks to living organisms and ecosystems. Wetlands are important sinks for MNPs, which can impact the ecological and environmental functions of wetland systems. However, the responses of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetlands to MNPs have rarely been evaluated. A multilevel meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of MNPs on GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions from wetlands. The results showed that the presence of MNPs generally led to increases in GHG emissions from wetlands, especially N2O emissions. MNP type and exposure dose were the decisive factors influencing wetland GHG emissions, with CO2 and N2O emissions stimulated by biodegradable MNPs made of polylactic acid and by a high MNP dose of 1–2%, while polystyrene reduced CO2 and N2O emissions, and a low MNP dose of less than 0.5% increased CH4 emissions. CO2 emissions from the sediment of coastal wetlands were more sensitive to MNP pollution, while CH4 emissions from the sediment of freshwater wetlands were significantly increased by MNP pollution. Furthermore, microbial diversity and the number of carbon–nitrogen cycling functional genes associated with GHG emissions in wetlands were increased by MNPs. More research on the effect of MNPs on GHG emissions from wetlands over a longer time is needed, especially in real wetland ecosystems with aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Tire wear particles (TWP) stand out as a major contributor to microplastic pollution, yet their environmental impact remains inadequately understood. This study delves into the cocktail effects of TWP leachates, employing molecular, cellular, and organismal assessments on diverse biological models. Extracted in artificial seawater and analyzed for metals and organic compounds, TWP leachates revealed the presence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and 4-tert-octylphenol. Exposure to TWP leachates (1.5 to 1000 mg peq L−1) inhibited algae growth and induced zebrafish embryotoxicity, pigment alterations, and behavioral changes. Cell painting uncovered pro-apoptotic changes, while mechanism-specific gene-reporter assays highlighted endocrine-disrupting potential, particularly antiandrogenic effects. Although heavy metals like zinc have been suggested as major players in TWP leachate toxicity, this study emphasizes water-leachable organic compounds as the primary causative agents of observed acute toxicity. The findings underscore the need to reduce TWP pollution in aquatic systems and enhance regulations governing highly toxic tire additives. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The issue of plastic pollution has dramatically intensified in the recent years. Our study investigates extensive plastic contamination of a sandy beach on a small Adriatic island. The beach was sampled on three occasions, in 2013, 2020 and 2022, using 1 m2 quadrats placed along the lower and upper strandlines, resulting in average litter concentrations of 385 ± 106, 1095 ± 522 and 129 ± 37 item m−2, respectively. The lower size limit of collected litter was 1 mm, thus including large microplastics. Plastic fragments (49–74 %) and plastic pellets (15 %–37 %) were predominant litter categories. The proportion of fragments is significantly higher during the tourist season with a more intensive cleaning regime (April–October), as opposed to the off-season (November–March). Fisheries and aquaculture litter was identified as a relevant source of pollution. More research is needed in the future into the microplastics smaller than 1 mm. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Low-cost and scalable technologies that allow people to measure microplastics in their local environment could facilitate a greater understanding of the global problem of marine microplastic pollution. A typical way to measure marine microplastic pollution involves imaging filtered seawater samples stained with a fluorescent dye to aid in the detection of microplastics. Although traditional fluorescence microscopy allows these particles to be manually counted and detected, this is a resource- and labour-intensive task. Here, we describe a novel, low-cost microscope for automated scanning and detection of microplastics in filtered seawater samples - the EnderScope. This microscope is based on the mechanics of a low-cost 3D printer (Creality Ender 3). The hotend of the printer is replaced with an optics module, allowing for the reliable and calibrated motion system of the 3D printer to be used for automated scanning over a large area (>20 × 20 cm). The EnderScope is capable of both reflected light and fluorescence imaging. In both configurations, we aimed to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible, for example, by using low-cost LEDs for illumination and lighting gels as emission filters. We believe this tool is a cost-effective solution for microplastic measurement.

       " Due to the potential impacts of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) on algal growth and thereby affect the climate-relevant substances, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), we studied the polystyrene (PS) MPs and NPs of 1 μm and 80 nm impacts on the growth, chlorophyll content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzyme activity, and DMS/DMSP production in Emiliania huxleyi. E. huxleyi is a prominent oceanic alga that plays a key role in DMS and DMSP production. The results revealed that high concentrations of MPs and NPs inhibited the growth, carotenoid (Car), and Chl a concentrations of E. huxleyi. However, short-time exposure to low concentrations of PS MPs and NPs stimulated the growth of E. huxleyi. Furthermore, high concentrations of MPs and NPs resulted in an increase in the superoxide anion radical (O2.–) production rate and a decrease in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared with the low concentrations. Exposure to MPs and NPs at 5 mg L−1 induced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as a response to scavenging ROS. High concentrations of MPs and NPs significantly inhibited the production of DMSP and DMS. The findings of this study support the potential ecotoxicological impacts of MPs and NPs on algal growth, antioxidant system, and dimethylated sulfur compounds production, which maybe potentially impact the global climate. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution of the ocean is a top environmental concern. Biodegradable plastics present a potential “solution” in combating the accumulation of plastic pollution, and their production is currently increasing. While these polymers will contribute to the future plastic marine debris budget, very little is known still about the behavior of biodegradable plastics in different natural environments. In this study, we molecularly profiled entire microbial communities on laboratory confirmed biodegradable polybutylene sebacate-co-terephthalate (PBSeT) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) films, and non-biodegradable conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films that were incubated in situ in three different coastal environments in the Mediterranean Sea. Samples from a pelagic, benthic, and eulittoral habitat were taken at five timepoints during an incubation period of 22 months. We assessed the presence of potential biodegrading bacterial and fungal taxa and contrasted them against previously published in situ disintegration data of these polymers. Scanning electron microscopy imaging complemented our molecular data. Putative plastic degraders occurred in all environments, but there was no obvious “core” of shared plastic-specific microbes. While communities varied between polymers, the habitat predominantly selected for the underlying communities. Observed disintegration patterns did not necessarily match community patterns of putative plastic degraders. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Marine ecological environmental management constitutes a fundamental pillar in the establishment of a comprehensive worldwide marine governance framework. Employing bibliometric methodologies, this article systematically explores and explicates the developmental history and prevailing focal points of research pertaining to marine ecological environmental governance spanning the period from 1990 to 2022. The findings of this study unveil an exponential surge in the publication of relevant literature since 2013. Notably, the majority of these research has been disseminated through high-impact journals such as Ecological Indicators, Science of the Total Environment and Marine Pollution Bulletin. Throughout the past three decades, the global pursuit of marine ecological environmental governance has evolved from an initial emphasis on pollution sources to the protection of ecosystems, subsequently including global environmental concerns, thus embracing problem-oriented and comprehensive solutions. The results of this study demonstrate that the present focal points predominantly revolve around the implications of microplastic pollution on marine sediments, the mechanisms underlying the restoration of marine ecosystems in nature reserves, as well as the analysis of factors driving environmental changes and the formulation of corresponding response strategies. Finally, this article proffers a number of recommendations and perspectives for future research in global marine ecological environmental governance. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " 3,3′,4,4′,5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) is the most toxic congener of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL PCBs), while nanoplastics (NPs) have recently emerged as significant marine pollutants, both posing threats to aquatic organisms and human health. They coexist in the environment, but their comprehensive toxicological effects remain unclear. In this study, zebrafish embryos were simultaneously exposed to PCB126 and 80-nanometer nanoplastyrene (NPS). Researchers utilized fluorescence microscopy, qPCR, histopathological examination, and transcriptomic sequencing to investigate the developmental toxicity of different concentrations of PCB126 and NPS individually or in combination on zebrafish embryos and larvae. Results indicate that the chorion significantly impedes the accumulation of NPS (p < 0.05). It is noteworthy that this barrier effect diminishes upon simultaneous exposure to PCB126. In this experiment, the semi-lethal concentration of PCB126 for larvae was determined to be 6.33 μg/L. Exposure to PCB126 induces various deformities, primarily mediated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Similarly, exposure to NPS also activates AHR, leading to developmental impairments. Furthermore, transcriptomic sequencing revealed similar effects of PCB126 and NPS on the gene expression trends in zebrafish larvae, but combined exposure to both exacerbates the risk of cancer and induces more severe cardiac toxicity. At this level, co-exposure to PCB126 and NPS adversely affects the development of zebrafish larvae. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the in vivo accumulation of DL polychlorinated biphenyls and microplastics in actual aquatic environments and their impact on fish development. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have been widely documented in marine biota, with a notable presence in bivalve species. This study examines microplastic (MP) contamination in oysters across a subtropical estuarine system, revealing widespread and highly variable levels of contamination. Our results indicate a general trend of higher contamination in areas with greater anthropogenic impact, and unexpectedly high values in remote Marine Protected Areas, suggesting alternative sources of MPs. We observed a 94.31 % frequency of occurrence and an average contamination level of 8.16 ± 6.39 MP.ind1, 1.06 ± 1.28 MP.g-1ww, and 7.54 ± 6.55 MP.g-1dw. Transparent fibers, predominantly composed of polyester and polyethylene from likely textile origins, were the most common. The findings underscore the significance of MP pollution in marine environments, even in protected zones. For enhanced spatial assessment and consistent data comparison, we recommend that future studies include MP quantities in terms of dry weight (MP.g-1dw) and biometric data such as size and weight. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Environmental pollution caused by the excessive use of plastics has resulted in the inflow of microplastics into the human body. However, the effects of microplastics on the human gut microbiota still need to be better understood. To determine whether plastic-degrading bacteria exist in the human gut, we collected the feces of six human individuals, did enrichment cultures and screened for bacterial species with a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or polypropylene (PP)-degrading activity using a micro-spray method. We successfully isolated four bacterial species with an LDPE-degrading activity and three with a PP-degrading activity. Notably, all bacterial species identified with an LDPE or PP-degrading activity were opportunistic pathogens. We analyzed the microbial degradation of the LDPE or PP surface using scanning electron microscopy and confirmed that each bacterial species caused the physical changes. Chemical structural changes were further investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy, confirming the oxidation of the LDPE or PP surface with the formation of carbonyl groups (C=O), ester groups (C[sbnd]O), and hydroxyl groups (-OH) by each bacterial species. Finally, high temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) analysis showed that these bacterial species performed to a limited extent depolymerization. These results indicate that, as a single species, these opportunistic pathogens in the human gut have a complete set of enzymes and other components required to initiate the oxidation of the carbon chains of LDPE or PP and to degrade them. Furthermore, these findings suggest that these bacterial species can potentially biodegrade and metabolize microplastics in the human gut. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marine litter poses a significant environmental challenge in the Saronikos Gulf, Greece. Employing an integrated approach, data from both beach and underwater sites were analyzed. The average litter density on beaches was 2.61 items m−2, with plastic being the most common material, notably small polystyrene fragments and cigarette butts. The western part of the Gulf exhibited higher litter density, mainly due to surface circulation patterns. Most beaches fell short of meeting Good Environmental Status criteria for marine litter. Higher litter densities were observed in autumn. Benthic litter density decreased with depth, being 23 times higher in shallower waters, with plastic being the predominant type. This extensive study offers crucial insights into the pollution status and litter distribution in the Saronikos Gulf, contributing significantly to the global understanding of marine litter distribution on coastal ecosystems. Such information is crucial for raising awareness, informing policy decisions, and driving environmental actions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In this study, the accumulation rate of plastic litter was investigated by sampling quadrats placed on the North Island of Qilianyu, and the composition was analyzed and identified to determine its source. The results showed that the annual average accumulation rate of plastic litter on North Island was 0.64 ± 0.32 pieces·m−2·month−1, with a mass accumulation rate of 11.30 ± 7.73 g·m−2·month−1. The accumulation rate of plastic litter was mainly influenced by wind speed and direction, with higher accumulation rates occurring during the southwest monsoon season and tropical cyclones. ATR-FTIR analysis indicated that polyethylene (44 %) and polypropylene (41 %) were the most abundant types of polymers. This study reveals the current status of plastic litter pollution in green turtle nesting grounds on North Island in Qilianyu, which can be used as a reference for management strategies that mitigate plastic litter pollution. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic materials are used in various domains, such as constructions, textile, or medical applications, due to their durability and versatility. Despite plastics contribution to human wellbeing, these materials can also have a negative impact on ecosystems, leading to water pollution and loss of aquatic life. However, no study has been made, so far, to determine the impact of plastic products on natural particle size distribution in water systems. The aim of this study is to evaluate if plastic affects aquatic particulate matter of different size ranges, from 0.3 to 16 000 nm. Three types of plastics (polystyrene [PS], polypropylene [PP], and low-density polyethylene [LDPE]) have been added to lake water samples and incubated for nine months at room temperature. Results show that the average particle size increases toward the end of the experiment indicating that small particles (<1200 nm) adhere to plastic surfaces, while medium and large particles sediment in the water sample. Also, substances migrating from plastic may alter the aggregating properties of particles. However, the influence may be less substantial in the environment, as plastic types and concentrations differ. Moreover, more studies are needed to establish additional implications in relation to bacterial communities, transport of pollutants, or chemical composition. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.,\n",
       " The microbial degradation of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) resins in rivers and lakes has emerged as a crucial issue in the management of microplastics. This study revealed that as the flow rate decreased longitudinally, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), heavy fraction of organic carbon (HFOC), and small-size microplastics (< 1 mm) gradually accumulated in the deep and downstream estuarine sediments. Based on their surface morphology and carbonyl index, these sediments were identified as the potential hot zone for PE/PP degradation. Within the identified hot zone, concentrations of PE/PP-degrading genes, enzymes, and bacteria were significantly elevated compared to other zones, exhibiting strong intercorrelations. Analysis of niche differences revealed that the accumulation of NH4+-N and HFOC in the hot zone facilitated the synergistic coexistence of key bacteria responsible for PE/PP degradation within biofilms. The findings of this study offer a novel insight and comprehensive understanding of the distribution characteristics and synergistic degradation potential of PE/PP in natural freshwater environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Urban clusters are recognized as hotspots of microplastic pollution, and the associated urban rivers convey microplastics into the global oceans. Despite this knowledge, the relative contributions of various sources to the annual microplastic emissions from urban catchments remain scarcely quantified. Here, we quantified microplastic emissions from a riverine urban catchment in Japan. The total microplastics (size range: 10–5000 μm) released from the catchment amounted to 269.1 tons/annum, of which 78.1% is contributed by surface runoff and other uncontrolled emissions (UCE), and 21.1% emerges from the regulated wastewater (controlled emissions; CE), implying that approximately one-fifth is intercepted and removed by the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This further indicated higher microplastic pollution by unmanaged surface runoff compared to untreated wastewater. In the dry season, WWTPs contributed significantly to the reduction of total microplastic emissions (95%) compared to wet periods (8%). On an annual scale, the treated effluent occupies only 0.1% of the total microplastics released to the river network (212.4 tons/annum), while the remaining portion is dominated by UCE, i.e., primarily surface runoff emissions (98.9%), and trivially by the background microplastic inputs that are potentially derived through atmospheric depositions in dry days (1.0%). It was shown that moderate and heavy rainfall events which occur during 18% of the year (within the context of Japan), leading to 95% of the annual microplastic emissions, are crucial for pollution control of urban rivers. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that surface area-normalized microplastic emissions from an urban catchment (∼0.8 tons/km2/annum) is globally relevant, especially for planning microplastic interventions for developed cities. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " After describing how the marine environment is tottering in the face of the triple environmental crisis, this article explores the limited governance progressions at the global and regional levels in addressing the threats of pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss in the especially vulnerable Arctic. For pollution, key limitations include slow and arduous processes to add chemicals for control under the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions and reliance at the regional level on a fragmented array of pollution studies and projects but without specific region-wide legally binding pollution standards. For climate change, the world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature targets which is especially problematic for the Arctic cryosphere while the Arctic Council has largely been limited to providing general statements of concern and aspirational calls for enhanced climate mitigation and adaptation actions. For marine biodiversity losses, a pan-Arctic network of marine protected areas has yet to be developed and various implementation challenges surround the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean including the need to ensure adequate financial, human resource and technical support. The paper concludes by highlighting some promising future governance directions. They include: the conclusion of a global treaty on plastic pollution; implementation of a new Global Framework on Chemicals - For a Planet Free of Harm from Chemicals and Waste; expected further clarifications from international tribunals on State responsibilities to address climate change; and regional implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the new agreement under the UN Convention on Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.  © 2024 - The authors.

       " Microplastic has emerged as a global threat owing to its chronic ubiquity and persistence. Microplastics’ small size expedites their ingestion at each trophic level causing biomagnification and bioaccumulation, which has raised public concerns. The present study isolated, quantified and characterized the abundance, shape, size, color, and chemical composition of the microplastics from water and sediments of the Hirakud Reservoir through a scanning electron microscope and FTIR. The ecological risk associated with the microplastics was assessed using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method to derive the Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) value and risk quotient (RQ). The abundance of microplastics in the surface water and sediments of the Hirakud Reservoir was estimated at 82–89 particles/L and 159–163 particles/kg, respectively. Fiber-shaped microplastics dominated both surface water (46.21%) and sediment samples (44.86%). Small-sized microplastics (53–300 μm) prevailed in all samples. Color delineation exhibited an abundance of transparent microplastics. Chemical characterization indicated the dominance of polypropylene (38%), followed by high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polystyrene. The calculated PNEC value was 3,954 particles/m3, and the RQ was estimated to be 0.02073–0.04122 indicating negligible ecological risk to freshwater species in all the sampling sites. © 2024 The Authors.,\n",

       " Detection of small plastic particles in environmental water samples has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. A multitude of techniques, such as variants of Raman spectroscopy, have been employed to facilitate their analysis in such complex sample matrices. However, these studies are often conducted for a limited number of plastic types in matrices with relatively little additional materials. Thus, much remains unknown about what parameters influence the detection limits of Raman spectroscopy for more environmentally relevant samples. To address this, this study utilizes Raman spectroscopy to detect six plastic particle types; 161 and 33 nm polystyrene, < 450 nm and 36 nm poly(ethylene terephthalate), 121 nm polypropylene, and 126 nm polyethylene; spiked into artificial saltwater, artificial freshwater, North Sea, Thames River, and Elbe River water. Overall, factors such as plastic particle properties, water matrix composition, and experimental setup were shown to influence the final limits of detection. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastics are offering a new niche for microorganisms colonizing their surface, the so-called “plastisphere,” in which diversity and community structure remain to be characterized and compared across ocean pelagic regions. Here, we compared the bacterial diversity of microorganisms living on plastic marine debris (PMD) and the surrounding free-living (FL) and organic particle-attached (PA) lifestyles sampled during the Tara expeditions in two of the most plastic polluted zones in the world ocean, i.e., the North Pacific gyre and the Mediterranean Sea. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis confirmed that PMD are a new anthropogenic ocean habitat for marine microbes at the ocean-basin-scale, with clear niche partitioning compared to FL and PA lifestyles. At an ocean-basin-scale, the composition of the plastisphere communities was mainly driven by environmental selection, rather than polymer types or dispersal effect. A plastisphere “core microbiome” could be identified, mainly dominated by Rhodobacteraceae and Cyanobacteria. Predicted functions indicated the dominance of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms on PMD that open new questions on the role of the plastisphere in a large number of important ecological processes in the marine ecosystem.

       " Microplastics pose significant challenges on a global scale. In Ghana, these tiny pollutants infiltrate diverse ecosystems such as coastal areas, rivers, lakes, and forests, vital to the nation's economy and social well-being. This review examines the current depth of knowledge in research and the escalating concern of microplastics, identifying significant gaps in research and understanding. The findings highlight the limited understanding of the extent and distribution of microplastic pollution across different environmental compartments, primarily focusing on coastal environments. Additionally, detection and quantification techniques for microplastics face several complexities and limitations in the Ghanaian context due to constraints such as infrastructure, resources, and expertise. Despite some research efforts, particularly along the coastline, there is still a distinct lack of attention in various regions and ecosystems within Ghana. This imbalance in research focus hinders the understanding and effective mitigation of microplastics in the country. This therefore necessitates the implementation of systematic policy frameworks, emphasizing the importance of recycling and upcycling as effective strategies to address the challenges of microplastics in Ghana with more targeted research and public engagement. This review serves as a call to action for a strategic approach to research and policy-making on microplastic research and pollution in Ghana. © 2024,\n",
       " The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented plastic pollution from single-used personal protective equipment (PPE), especially face masks, in coastal and marine environments. The secondary pollutants, microplastics from face masks (mask MP), rise concern about their detrimental effects on marine organisms, terrestrial organisms and even human. Using a mouse model, oral exposure to mask MP at two doses, 0.1 and 1 mg MP/day for 21 days, caused no change in animal locomotion, total weight, or sperm counts, but caused damage to sperm motility with increased curvilinear velocity (VCL). The high-dose mask MP exposure caused a significant decrease in linearity (LIN) of sperm motility. Further testicular transcriptomic analysis revealed perturbed pathways related to spermatogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolism and energy production. Collectively, our findings substantiate that microplastics from face masks yield adverse effects on mammalian reproductive capacity, highlighting the need for improved plastic waste management and development of environmentally friendly materials. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution of the ocean is a major environmental threat. In this context, a better understanding of the microorganisms able to colonize and potentially degrade these pollutants is of interest. This study explores the colonization and biodegradation potential of fungal communities on foamed polystyrene and alternatives biodegradable plastics immersed in a marina environment over time, using the Brest marina (France) as a model site. The methodology involved a combination of high-throughput 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to investigate fungal taxa associated with plastics compared to the surrounding seawater, and a culture-dependent approach to isolate environmentally relevant fungi to further assess their capabilities to utilize polymers as carbon sources. Metabarcoding results highlighted the significant diversity of fungal communities associated with both foamed polystyrene and biodegradable plastics, revealing a dynamic colonization process influenced by the type of polymer and immersion time. Notably, the research suggests a potential for certain fungal species to utilize polymers as a carbon source, emphasizing the need for further exploration of fungal biodegradation potential and mechanisms. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Cigarette butts (CBs) are non-biodegradable harmful residues of synthetic origin and are widespread in marine environments around the world. Although environmental factors are often primarily responsible for the fragmentation of microplastics in the marine environment, biotic factors have recently been shown to be equally important in plastic debris. This study evaluates the role of the Hediste diversicolor polychaete in the fragmentation of CBs in the marine environment. Polychaetes were exposed to three concentrations of CB (0 (as the control), 0.25, and 1 butt L−1) at two different temperatures (15 °C and 23 °C) for 28 days. At each temperature, aquaria without polychaetes were used to study the effect of the burrowing activity of the polychaete on CB fragmentation. Toxicants analysed from exposed sediments increased their concentration in a dose-dependent manner to the CB concentration at a temperature of 15 °C but not at 23 °C. CBs did not directly decrease Hediste survival, but prolonged elevated temperatures increased the polychaetes’ susceptibility. The negative effects of CBs on burial success and burrowing behaviour could not be offset by the reduced start time caused by elevated temperatures. Regardless of temperature, both the weight loss and physical fragmentation of CBs buried in polychaete-contaminated sediments were significantly higher than those without Hediste, with no differences between the two concentrations tested. FTIR-ATR analysis used to evaluate CB degradation in relation to cellulose acetate decomposition showed a greater degradation of this compound in treatments with Hediste than in those without polychaetes (~2.75 times), but these differences were not significant. This study is a promising initial step for future research, as any factor that facilitates the fragmentation of this prevalent and hazardous waste must be carefully studied to extract the maximum benefit to help to reduce CBs in the marine environment. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Seaweed, a diverse and abundant marine resource, holds promise as a renewable feedstock for bioplastics due to its polysaccharide-rich composition. This review explores different methods for extracting and processing seaweed polysaccharides, focusing on the production of alginate plastic materials. Seaweed emerges as a promising solution, due to its abundance, minimal environmental impact, and diverse industrial applications, such as feed and food, plant and soil nutrition, nutraceutical hydrocolloids, personal care, and bioplastics. Various manufacturing techniques, such as solvent casting, injection moulding, and extrusion, are discussed for producing seaweed-based bioplastics. Alginate, obtained mainly from brown seaweed, is particularly known for its gel-forming properties and presents versatile applications in many sectors (food, pharmaceutical, agriculture). This review further examines the current state of the bioplastics market, highlighting the growing demand for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics.

       " Research on the occurrence of microplastics in invertebrates of the Thoothukudi region is limited. Capitellids are non-selective suspension feeders and are usually used as bioindicator of water pollution. Hence, an investigation was carried out to identify the microplastic occurrence in the capitellids (Capitella capitata) (Fabricius, 1780) collected from the Vellapatti and Spic Nagar sites of the Thoothukudi region. Result from this investigation showed the occurrence of 0.21 ± 0.17 items/indiv and a mean abundance of 13.33% in Thoothukudi coast. The mean microplastic abundance in the capitellids was significantly higher in the Spic Nagar (0.26 ± 0.19 MPs/indiv), probably due to the dumping of plastic waste, fishing and recreational activities. However, no significant difference was observed between seasons. Only fragments (Vellapatti 66.66% and Spic Nagar 33.33%) and fibre-shaped microplastics (Vellapatti 50% and Spic Nagar 50%) were identified. The size and colour of the microplastics dominant in both sites were 1–2 mm (Vellapatti 77.77% and Spic Nagar 75%) and blue (Vellapatti 88.88% and Spic Nagar 87.5%), respectively. The results of Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis revealed the presence of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) polymers in the capitellids. PE polymer is one of the most common sources of microplastics contamination globally and it is also frequently found in the coastal waters of Thoothukudi. This accounted for the high occurrence of PE polymers in the capitellids with the occurrence rate of 77% in Vellapatti and 58.52% in Spic Nagar. The present study provides baseline data on the occurrence, characterization (shapes, sizes and colours) and qualitative analysis of the microplastics in the capitellids, and their presence was influenced by their non-selective feeding habits. Further, future studies have to be conducted to identify the levels of microplastics in different polychaetes and other invertebrates to better understand the effects of microplastic pollution in invertebrate communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " The complex aquatic system of dam reservoirs is known to trap emerging pollutants as microplastics (MPs) in sediments and water column. Considering the knowledge gaps in this type of environment, we investigated the amount and distribution of MPs in the surface water layer, as well as in the surface and deep sediments of the Siriu Reservoir in the Buzău River system, which is located in the southern area of the Eastern Carpathians, Romania. There was a discrepancy between MP abundancy in both water and sediment samples collected near the reservoir (5.3 MPs/m3, 315.5 MPs/kg) and at several kilometers downstream of the dam (1.4 MPs/m3, 132.5 MPs/kg). The chronological accumulation of MPs in the lacustrine sediments was determined by analyzing 5 cm intervals of a 50 cm length core extracted from the reservoir bed. By comparing the concentration of MPs identified in each interval with the solid debit volumes registered in the last decade, we found that flood events could be traced easily due to abundant MP accumulation. Morphologically, the particles were observed mainly as fibers and fragments. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-iR) investigations identified most of the MPs as polypropylene (28%), polyethylene (26%), and polyethylene terephthalate (19%). © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " The omnipresence of microplastic pollution in the environment has become a main challenge in recent years. One of the primary concerns is the ecotoxicological impact of microplastics on marine ecosystems, as well as the potential risk to humans related to the accumulation of microplastics in the body. Although it has not yet been scientifically proven, their presence in drinking water is a main concern. Studies have shown various strategies and new material development approaches for effectively removing microplastics. Recently, nanocellulose has emerged as a promising bionanomaterial for wastewater treatment. The purpose of this review is to introduce the potential of nanocellulose for microplastic removal. This study consists of three main points: the synthesis method of nanocellulose, the fundamentals of nanocellulose, and the use of these materials for capturing and removing microplastics. In addition, the potential of nanocellulose for antifouling has also been demonstrated. We also provide information regarding the source, fate, and transportation of microplastics in the environment and how to detect them to obtain a better understanding of how microplastics behave and ultimately end up in drinking water systems. Furthermore, we also discuss major challenges and future perspectives concerning the applications of nanocellulose-based materials in microplastic removal. Overall, nanocellulose is a versatile material and further research should be carried out to explore nanocellulose potential to meet the specific requirements for microplastic removal. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Concerns over worldwide plastic pollution have led to the development of biodegradable polyester materials with excellent physical and chemical properties through the copolymerization of poly(butylene oxalate) (PBOx). As a result, poly(butylene oxalate-co-terephthalate)s (PBOTs) with varying compositions, were prepared by incorporating aromatic units. Studies have indicated that PBOT-47 (with a 47% molar terephthalate), exhibits exceptional mechanical properties. With an elongation at break of 1160% and a tensile strength that remains above 30 MPa, similar to or even better than those of the commercial biodegradable plastic poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) PBAT-47 (47% molar terephthalate). Moreover, the permeability coefficients of PBAT-47 for H2O, CO2 and O2 were 5.8, 50.6 and 5.6 times higher than that of PBOT-47, revealing the superior barrier properties of PBOT. Through experimental research and theoretical simulation, the mechanism of the copolymer hydrolysis was elucidated.

Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICWs) are potentially well suited to provide a cost-effective mitigation solution at small WWTPs where conventional treatment is prohibitively expensive. This study aimed to assess the microplastic and anthropogenic fibre retention efficiency of two ICWs (Northrepps and Ingoldisthorpe) in Norfolk (UK) over a 12-month period (2022–2023). Analysing a total of 54 water and 23 sediment samples, the findings revealed that Northrepps ICW received on average 349,920 (± 763,776) anthropogenic fibres day−1, with a retention rate of 99.3%. No seasonal variation was observed in retention efficiency. Ingoldisthorpe ICW intermittently received anthropogenic fibres in low concentrations, with an average of 9504 (± 19,872) day−1 and a retention rate of 100%. Microplastics and anthropogenic fibres were prevalent in sediment samples of the first cell of Northrepps ICW, averaging 10,090 items kg−1 dry sediment, while none were found at concentrations above the limit of detection in the second or third cell. Of the 369 fibres analysed by ATR-FTIR, 55% were plastic (dominated by polyester). Of the 140 suspected microplastic fragments analysed by ATR-FTIR, 73% were confidently identified as plastic (mostly polystyrene, polyethylene, or polypropylene). This study demonstrates how ICWs can effectively retain sewage effluent derived microplastics and anthropogenic fibres. However, the accumulation of plastic waste in ICWs may complicate long term management and their cost-effectiveness. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a significant collection of plastic introduced by human activities, provides an ideal environment to study bacterial lifestyles on plastic substrates. We proposed that bacteria colonizing the floating plastic debris would develop strategies to deal with the ultraviolet-exposed substrate, such as the production of antioxidant pigments. We observed a variety of pigmentation in 67 strains that were directly cultivated from plastic pieces sampled from the Garbage Patch. The genomic analysis of four representative strains, each distinct in taxonomy, revealed multiple pathways for carotenoid production. These pathways include those that produce less common carotenoids and a cluster of photosynthetic genes. This cluster appears to originate from a potentially new species of the Rhodobacteraceae family. This represents the first report of an aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacterium from plastic biofilms. Spectral analysis showed that the bacteria actively produce carotenoids, such as beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin, and bacteriochlorophyll a. Furthermore, we discovered that the genetic ability to synthesize carotenoids is more common in plastic biofilms than in the surrounding water communities. Our findings suggest that plastic biofilms could be an overlooked source of bacteria-produced carotenoids, including rare forms. It also suggests that photoreactive molecules might play a crucial role in bacterial biofilm communities in surface water. © 2024 The Authors.

       " The occurrence of microplastics in aquatic environments has attracted increasing interest from both the public and scientists, especially their migration behaviors. Although several environmental behaviors of microplastics have been studied, the issue of microplastic suspension and deposition in lake sediment–water systems remains to be elucidated. In this study, we built an indoor sediment–water system with input and output rivers that simulated the actual situations in lakes, and aimed to explore the suspension and deposition behavior of microplastics using eight group experiments. The abundance of microplastics in overlying water and sediments in different periods was analyzed, and the characteristics of hydrodynamic disturbance on microplastic suspension and deposition were identified. Importantly, the exchange of microplastics in sediments and water under dynamic flow conditions was assessed. The results showed that the middle-scale experiment designed in this study effectively simulated the dynamic transport process of microplastics in lakes, and the hydrodynamic force had a significant impact on the suspension and deposition behaviors of microplastics. The average abundance of polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide microplastics was 1.07, 0.60 and 0.83 particles/L in overlying water during the suspension experiments, respectively. This showed a pattern of first rising and then falling with the extension of suspension time. Even in the environment with the maximum input water volume (8000 ml/min) in this study, only microplastics at a depth of 0 to 2 cm from the sediment were suspended. The average abundance of microplastics was 313.02 particles/kg during the deposition experiments, which gradually increased with the extension of deposition time in sediments. Finally, microplastic sizes in water of the suspension experiments and in sediments of the deposition experiments were concentrated in the range of 500 to 1500 μm and 300 to 1000 μm, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have been recognized globally as a new environmental pollutant and can be transported in water environments all over the world. Diatoms contribute about 20% of marine primary productivity and play an important role in global carbon sequestration, climate regulation, and the biogeochemical cycling of biogenic elements. Understanding the impact of MPs on the primary biomass productivity of phytoplankton is crucial for assessing ecosystem resilience and maintaining essential ecosystem services. Here the relationships between phytoplankton physiological indicators and trace metal uptake were investigated to delineate how polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) affect the primary biomass productivity and alter the dynamics of trace metal sinks in marine ecosystems. We innovatively proposed that the influence of MPs on phytoplankton was not only shading effects on algae and causing oxidative damage, but also limiting the accumulation of trace metals in algae. The accumulation of Mn, Fe and Ni in algae is positively correlated with the content of chlorophyll a (Mn: r = 0.824; Fe: r = 0.697; Ni: r = 0.822), photosynthetic activity (Mn: r = 0.631; Fe: r = 0.467; Ni: r = 0.816) and β-carotene (Mn: r = 0.773; Fe: r = 0.307; Ni: r = 0.786), but negatively correlated with superoxide dismutase activity (Mn: r = −0.714; Fe: r = −0.730; Ni: r = −0.908). This provides a new perspective to reveal the influence mechanisms of MPs on primary biomass and trace metal sinks. © 2024,\n",
       " Mismanaged and excessive waste has adverse effects on natural environments, economies, and human health. To address these waste issues, the Sustainability with Awareness and Prevention Solutions Program was developed and implemented in communities along the Mississippi Gulf Coast (USA) with the aim to provide the knowledge and actions needed to reduce or eliminate mismanaged and excessive waste. The program uses four educational modules focused on (1) microplastics in the watershed, (2) food waste, (3) single-use plastics, and (4) involvement in community prevention and removal programs. The program curriculum was written to meet education standards in Mississippi for 5th grade gifted, 6–8th grades, and 9–12th grades, and can be easily adapted to other states’ curriculums. The program provides material incentives to participants so knowledge learned can immediately be translated to behavior change. The program is continually being developed to find the best methods to implement behavior change at multiple scales. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " The marine ecosystem is severely threatened by microplastics. The entire marine environment of the Black Sea is contaminated with both macro- and microplastics but the contamination of the water column with this pollutant has received less attention. This study aims to obtain data on the microplastic abundance, and vertical and temporal distribution of the microplastics in the water column of Hamsilos Bay which is a natural protected area, and an important area for fishery and tourism on the Sinop coast in the Black Sea. This study was carried out for 12 months in 7 stations. Microplastic abundance varied among 5.58 ± 6.12–8.12 ± 9.17 pieces/m3 in and 1.74 ± 0.80–21.07 ± 3.84 pieces/m3 in stations. The dominant microplastics were fibre by shape (73.92%), 1–2 mm (28.35%) by size class, and blue (37.98%) by colour. The synthetic polymers in the examined microplastic samples of this study were PET (47%), PE (34%), HDPE (10%), PVC (7%) and PS (2%). The results of this study show that the coastal area is widely contaminated with microplastics. Microplastic pollution is an increasingly significant environmental issue that poses a threat to the Black Sea which is particularly vulnerable to microplastic pollution. The region is an important ecological hotspot in the Black Sea and this study can provide valuable insights into the extent of microplastic pollution and will contribute to the literature on the evaluation of microplastic pollution in marine ecosystems. These types of investigations; efforts to address the environmental challenges facing the Black Sea, including the development of programs to reduce pollution, increase sustainability, and support the protection of the region's natural resources, are crucial to its continuity. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The accumulation of microplastics in reservoirs due to river damming has drawn considerable attention due to their potential impacts on elemental biogeochemical cycling at the watershed scale. However, the effects of plastisphere communities on the sulfur cycle in the large deep-water reservoir remain poorly understood. Here, we collected microplastics and their surrounding environmental samples in the water and sediment ecosystems of Xiaowan Reservoir and found a significant spatiotemporal pattern of microplastics and sulfur distribution in this Reservoir. Based on the microbial analysis, plastic-degrading taxa (e.g., Ralstonia, Rhodococcus) involved in the sulfur cycle were enriched in the plastisphere of water and sediment, respectively. Typical thiosulfate oxidizing bacteria Limnobacter acted as keystone species in the plastisphere microbial network. Sulfate, oxidation reduction potential and organic matter drove the variations of the plastisphere. Environmental filtration significantly affected the plastisphere communities, and the deterministic process dominated the community assembly. Furthermore, predicted functional profiles related to sulfur cycling, compound degradation and membrane transport were significantly enriched in the plastisphere. Overall, our results suggest microplastics as a new microbial niche exert different effects in water and sediment environments, and provide insights into the potential impacts of the plastisphere on the sulfur biogeochemical cycle in the reservoir ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Community-based marine debris removal efforts on the Hawaiian Islands of Kaua'i and Hawai'i, spanning 2013–2022, provided large datasets and documented remarkable variations in annual amounts of debris, mainly from abandoned, lost and derelict fishing gear. To test the hypothesis that the influx of marine debris on Hawaiian shores is determined by the proximity of the North Pacific garbage patch, whose pattern changes under the control of large-scale ocean dynamics, we compared these observational data with the output of an oceanographic drift model. The high correlations between the total mass of debris collected and the model, ranging between r = 0.81 and r = 0.84, validate the attribution of the strong interannual signal to significant migrations of the garbage patch reproduced in the model experiments. Synchronous variations in marine debris fluxes on the two islands, separated by >500 km, confirm the large scale of the interannual changes in the North Pacific marine debris system. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " The pollution of antibiotics and microplastics in mariculture environments has elicited widespread concern due to their potential threats to health of aquatic organisms and stability and function of marine ecosystems. However, the toxicological outcomes of the combined exposure of antibiotics and microplastics on fish are still unclear. In this work, two kinds of veterinary antibiotics commonly used in marine culture environment were selected to explore the effects of their combined exposure with polyamide microplastics on the growth performance and nutritional quality of Sebastes schlegelii. The results showed that, compared with the unexposed group, the individual exposure of antibiotic and microplastic significantly reduced the weight gain rate (194.3- 200.4%) and specific growth rate (211.4- 218.1%) of the juvenile fish. Compared with the unexposed group, the weight gain rate and specific growth rate of juveniles were significantly reduced by 272.8- 347.5% in the combined exposure, indicated that the combined exposure had a synergistic effect on the growth inhibition of juvenile fish. This study provided basic theoretical data for the risk assessment of antibiotics and microplastics in the marine culture environment. © 2024 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.,\n",
       " Microplastics are well known as contaminants in marine environments. With the development of biofilms, most microplastics will eventually sink and deposit in benthic environment. However, little research has been done on benthic toxic dinoflagellates, and the effects of microplastics on benthic dinoflagellates are unknown. Prorocentrum lima is a cosmopolitan toxic benthic dinoflagellate, which can produce a range of polyether metabolites, such as diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins. In order to explore the impact of microplastics on marine benthic dinoflagellates, in this paper, we studied the effects of polystyrene (PS) on the growth and toxin production of P. lima. The molecular response of P. lima to microplastic stress was analyzed by transcriptomics. We selected 100 nm, 10 μm and 100 μm PS, and set three concentrations of 1 mg L−1, 10 mg L−1 and 100 mg L−1. The results showed that PS exposure had limited effects on cell growth, but increased the OA and extracellular polysaccharide content at high concentrations. After exposure to PS MPs, genes associated with DSP toxins synthesis, carbohydrate synthesis and energy metabolism, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism, were significantly up-regulated. We speculated that after exposure to microplastics, P. lima may increase the synthesis of DSP toxins and extracellular polysaccharides, improve the level of energy metabolism and gene expression of ABC transporter, thereby protecting algal cells from damage. Our findings provide new insights into the effects of microplastics on toxic benthic dinoflagellates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The article focuses on the abundance of microplastics (MPs) in various environmental matrices, such as sediment and water, and their potential impacts. MPs can be considered as plastic particles that are less than 5 mm in dimension. The article presents an overview of the methods used for detecting and quantifying MPs in environmental samples, including spectroscopic techniques, microscopy, and chemical digestion. It also summarizes the current understanding of the distribution and abundance of MPs in various environmental compartments highlighting their importance in different environmental compartments. This article further discusses the potential impacts of MPs on different biota, such as marine organisms and terrestrial animals, and their ability to act as carriers for pollutants and other harmful substances. The review emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the impacts of MPs and to develop effective management strategies to mitigate their environmental effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution has escalated into a critical global issue, with production soaring from 2 million metric tons in 1950 to 400.3 million metric tons in 2022. The packaging industry alone accounts for nearly 44% of this production, predominantly utilizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Alarmingly, over 90% of the approximately 1 million PET bottles sold every minute end up in landfills or oceans, where they can persist for centuries. This highlights the urgent need for sustainable management and recycling solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of PET waste. To better understand PET’s behavior and promote its management within a circular economy, we examined its chemical and physical properties, current strategies in the circular economy, and the most effective recycling methods available today. Advancing PET management within a circular economy framework by closing industrial loops has demonstrated benefits such as reduced landfill waste, minimized energy consumption, and conserved raw resources. To this end, we identified and examined various strategies based on R-imperatives (ranging from 3R to 10R), focusing on the latest approaches aimed at significantly reducing PET waste by 2040. Additionally, a comparison of PET recycling methods (including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary recycling, along with the concepts of “zero-order” and biological recycling techniques) was envisaged. Particular attention was paid to the heterogeneous catalytic glycolysis, which stands out for its rapid reaction time (20–60 min), high monomer yields (>90%), ease of catalyst recovery and reuse, lower costs, and enhanced durability. Accordingly, the use of highly efficient oxide-based catalysts for PET glycolytic degradation is underscored as a promising solution for large-scale industrial applications. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " In this study, microplastic samples from surface seawater of Tokyo Bay were collected, polyethylene (PE) microplastics were used to calculate carbonyl index (CI), and average spectra of PE were analyzed and compared with a previous study applying agitation during chemical treatment. It was found that PE and polypropylene (PP) were the predominant polymer type in the samples. Among PE samples, fragments were the most commonly observed shape, with white being the dominant color. Deviations were found in the average spectra among different shapes and colors when compared to the standard PE spectrum. A comparison of the average spectra between the two datasets suggests that pronounced peaks related to oxidation are most likely resulted from agitation during the chemical treatment. Additionally, it was found a closer spectral resemblance between the sample spectra and the spectrum of standard sample of oxidized PE (PEOx) than with the standard PE spectrum, suggesting that using the oxidized PE as a reference spectrum might be more effective for identification. These findings highlight the complex factors affecting the spectral properties of microplastics and highlight the importance of understanding these variations to enhance the accuracy of microplastic identification workflows and understanding of environmental fate of microplastics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Density separation can isolate microplastics from environmental samples containing sediment. Typically, a solution added to sediment causes microplastics with lower densities to float. The solution of choice can influence the recovery of different particles since denser solutions can separate a greater range of microplastics. The equipment and procedural complexity further influence density separation protocols and microplastic recoveries. Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) is frequently used to isolate high-density polymers from environmental samples yet is rarely validated with simple, well-described protocols. A simple overflow method using ZnCl2 to isolate microplastics from sediment samples is described following a 3-step process: (1. Separation) ZnCl2 (1.7 g cm−3) solution is added to a sediment sample, agitated then settled; (2. Overflows) buoyant particles at the surface of the solution are overflowed twice; (3. Filtration) the overflowed solution is filtered. In a validation experiment with polyamide, rubber, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate/polyester, the mean recovery using this overflow method was 96 % ± 0.6 (standard error). This overflow density separation method proposes an accessible and reliable protocol to extract medium and high-density microplastics. • Microplastic separation with concentrated ZnCl2 solution • Simple overflow of buoyant particles • Reliable extraction of microplastics © 2024,\n",
       " To date, enumerable fungi have been reported to participate in the biodegradation of several notorious plastic materials following their isolation from soil of plastic-dumping sites, marine water, waste of mulch films, landfills, plant parts and gut of wax moth. The general mechanism begins with formation of hydrophobin and biofilm proceding to secretion of specific plastic degarding enzymes (peroxidase, hydrolase, protease and urease), penetration of three dimensional substrates and mineralization of plastic polymers into harmless products. As a result, several synthetic polymers including polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane and/or bio-degradable plastics have been validated to deteriorate within months through the action of a wide variety of fungal strains predominantly Ascomycota (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium spp.). Understanding the potential and mode of operation of these organisms is thus of prime importance inspiring us to furnish an up to date view on all the presently known fungal strains claimed to mitigate the plastic waste problem. Future research henceforth needs to be directed towards metagenomic approach to distinguish polymer degrading microbial diversity followed by bio-augmentation to build fascinating future of waste disposal. © The Author(s) 2023.,\n",
       " Microplastics (<5 mm in diameter) are ubiquitous in the oceanic environment, yet microplastic accumulation in marine mammals is vastly understudied. In recent years, efforts have been made to document microplastic profiles in odontocetes. The objective of the present study was to describe and quantify microplastics in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of deceased odontocetes that stranded in the southeastern United States. Our study included 24 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), two pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps), one pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), one short-snouted spinner dolphin (Stenella clymene), one Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), and one dwarf sperm whale (Kogia sima) obtained from stranding networks in Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Contents found in the GI tracts, namely, the stomach and portions of the intestinal tract, were subjected to a laboratory procedure to isolate microplastics. The physical characteristics of microparticles were analyzed with a stereomicroscope, and microplastics were classified by polymer type via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. There was an average of 47.6 ± 41.4 microparticles, ranging from 1 to 193 items per stomach. More specifically, there was an average of 5.6 ± 4.7 microplastics per stomach. The predominant morphologies, colors, and polymer types were fibers, white-colored items, and polyester, respectively. This research contributes to the current knowledge of microplastic exposure in top marine mammal predators and sets the stage for further exploration into the associated risks of microplastics in odontocetes within the United States and worldwide.

       " Many Chinese rivers are polluted with multiple pollutants. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the annual inputs of nutrients, macro-and microplastics, and Cryptosporidium (a pathogen) to 395 Chinese rivers from agriculture and urbanization-related sources during 2010–2050 following the storyline of Shared Socio-economic Pathway 3 and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Our model estimates that multiple pollutants in Chinese rivers are projected to increase by 41–88 % between 2010 and 2050. Central, eastern, and southern Chinese sub-basins may be more polluted in the future. In half of the sub-basins, at least two types of pollutants are expected to increase by over 50 % during 2010–2050. By 2050, nutrients and plastics in rivers are projected to increase by 70 % due to urbanization. For nutrients and Cryptosporidium in rivers increases of 49–88 % are projected, due to agricultural activities. In contrast, water is expected to get cleaner in some western sub-basins by 2050 because of fewer human activities. Our insights about multiple pollutants in Chinese rivers could help prioritize water pollution reduction strategies for sub-basins. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics have become a widespread concern within marine environments and are particularly evident in aquaculture regions that are characterized by plastic accumulation. This study employed 16 S rDNA sequencing to investigate the dynamic succession of microbial communities colonizing polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and polyamide (PA) microplastics in seawater, when subjected to varying exposure durations in the Liusha Bay aquaculture region. Results revealed that the composition of microplastics microbial communities varied remarkably across geographical locations and exposure times. With an increase in exposure duration, both the diversity and richness of bacterial communities colonizing microplastics significantly increased, microbial communities show adaptations to the plastisphere. The type of microplastics had a significant effect on the community structure characteristicsof bacteria attached to their surfaces, with inconsistent trends in the relative abundance of different genera on different substrates. Notably, microplastic surfaces harbored a significant abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, exemplified by Erythrobacter. These findings underscore the potential of microplastics as unique microbial niches. Meanwhile, long-term exposure experiments also offer the possibility of screening for plastic-degrading bacteria. In addition, the presence of the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio was detected in all microplastic samples, implying that microplastics could serve as carriers for pathogenic dissemination. This underscores the urgency of addressing the risk posed by the proliferation of harmful bacteria on microplastic surfaces. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of microbial community dynamics on microplastics under diverse conditions. It contributes to the broader comprehension of plastisphere microbial ecosystems in the marine environment, thereby addressing critical environmental implications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), recognized as an emerging environmental menace, have been extensively investigated in both marine and terrestrial fauna. This study is comprehensive to investigate how polystyrene (PS) affects ruminant animals. The experimental design comprised 24 individually housed lambs, divided into a CON group (diet without PS) and three PS-exposed (25 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm) groups, each with six lambs, the exposure of PS was 100 mg/day, and the duration of exposure was 60 days. The study yielded noteworthy results: (ⅰ) PS leads to a decrease in average daily gain along with an increase in feed conversion rate. (ⅱ) PS decreases rumen ammonia nitrogen. The rumen microbiota diversity remains consistent. However, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria increased in the PS-exposed groups, while the relative abundance of Coriobacteriales_incertae_Sedis and Prevotellaceae_YAB2003_group decreased. (ⅲ) PS leads to decrease in hemoglobin, thrombocytocrit, and albumin levels in lamb blood, thus triggering oxidative stress accumulation, along with swelling of the kidneys and liver. (ⅳ) PS inflicts severe damage to jejunum, consequently impacting digestion and absorption. (ⅴ) PS reduces meat quality and the nutritional value. In conclusion, PS-exposure inhibited lambs’ digestive function, adversely affects blood and organs’ health status, reducing average daily gain and negatively influencing meat quality. PS particles of 50–100 μm bring worse damage to lambs. This research aims to fill the knowledge void concerning MPs’ influences on ruminant animals, with a specific focus on the meat quality of fattening lambs. © 2024,\n",
       " Mangroves, a major ecosystem for carbon sequestration, have been recently identified as a microplastic sink, yet the impact of microplastics on the mangrove microbial community is poorly known. Here, we investigated the metabolic activities of mangrove rhizosphere microbiome in the presence of polyethylene, polystyrene, polyamide, and polyvinylchloride, in microcosms, using Biolog™ Ecoplates. Results show that microbial communities in mangrove sediment hold their functional diversity and comprehensive metabolic activity within 56 days of microplastic exposure. However, polyamide and polyvinylchloride microplastics induced a 59.6–66.7% reduction in the rhizosphere microbes’ utilization for their preferred polymer carbon sources. Microbes exposed to polyethylene microplastics showed an activated biotransformation for nitrogen-contained carbon sources.

       " We provide evidence of anthropogenic materials ingestion in seabirds from a remote oceanic area, using regurgitates obtained from black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) chicks from Middleton Island (Gulf of Alaska, USA). By means of GPS tracking of breeding adults, we identified foraging grounds where anthropogenic materials were most likely ingested. They were mainly located within the continental shelf of the Gulf of Alaska and near the Alaskan coastline. Anthropogenic cellulose fibers showed a high prevalence (85 % occurrence), whereas synthetic polymers (in the micro- and mesoplastics dimensional range) were less frequent (20 %). Most fibers (60 %) were blue and we confirmed the presence of indigo-dyed cellulosic fibers, characteristic of denim fabrics. In terms of mass, contamination levels were 0.077 μg g−1 wet weight and 0.009 μg g−1 wet weight for anthropogenic microfibers and synthetic polymers, respectively. These results represent the only recent report of contamination by anthropogenic fibers in seabirds from the Gulf of Alaska. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " People of all ages consume salt every day, but is it really just salt? Plastic nanoparticles [nanoplastics (NPs)] pose an increasing environmental threat and have begun to contaminate everyday salt in consumer goods. Herein, we developed a combined surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) approach that can realize the filtration, enrichment, and detection of NPs in commercial salt. The Au-loaded (50 nm) anodic alumina oxide substrate was used as the SERS substrate to explore the potential types of NP contaminants in salts. SRS was used to conduct imaging and quantify the presence of the NPs. SRS detection was successfully established through standard plastics, and NPs were identified through the match of the hydrocarbon group of the nanoparticles. Simultaneously, the NPs were quantified based on the high spatial resolution and rapid imaging of the SRS imaging platform. NPs in sea salts produced in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and the Atlantic were studied. We estimate that, depending on the location, an average person could be ingesting as many as 6 million NPs per year through the consumption of sea salt alone. The potential health hazards associated with NP ingestion should not be underestimated. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " While global attention has been primarily focused on the occurrence and persistence of microplastics (MP) in urban lakes, relatively little attention has been paid to the problem of MP pollution in rural recreational lakes. This pioneering study aims to shed light on MP size, composition, abundance, spatial distribution, and contributing factors in a rural recreational lake, ‘Nikli Lake’ in Kishoreganj, Bangladesh. Using density separation, MPs were extracted from 30 water and 30 sediment samples taken from ten different locations in the lake. Subsequent characterization was carried out using a combination of techniques, including a stereomicroscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The results showed a significant prevalence of MPs in all samples, with an average amount of 109.667 ± 10.892 pieces/kg3 (dw) in the sediment and 98.167 ± 12.849 pieces/m3 in the water. Small MPs (<0.5 mm), fragments and transparent colored particles formed the majority, accounting for 80.2%, 64.5% and 55.3% in water and 78.9%, 66.4% and 64.3% in sediment, respectively. In line with global trends, polypropylene (PP) (53%) and polyethylene (PE) (43%) emerged as the predominant polymers within the MPs. MP contents in water and sediment showed positive correlations with outflow, while they correlated negatively with inflow and lake depth (p > 0.05). Local activities such as the discharge of domestic sewage, fishing waste and agricultural runoff significantly influence the distribution of polypropylene. Assessment of pollution factor, pollution risk index and pollution load index values at the sampling sites confirmed the presence of MPs, with values above 1. This study is a baseline database that provides a comprehensive understanding of MP pollution in the freshwater ecosystem of Bangladesh, particularly in a rural recreational lake. A crucial next step is to explore ecotoxicological mechanisms, legislative measures and future research challenges triggered by MP pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Anthropogenic pollution poses a threat to marine conservation by causing chronic toxic effects. Seabirds have contact throughout their lives with pollutants like plastic, metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs). We assessed 155 Manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus) stranded along the Brazilian coast, analyzing associations between organic pollutants, plastic ingestion, biomarkers (transcript levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor, cytochrome P450-1A-5 [CYP1A5], UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase [UGT1], estrogen receptor alpha-1 [ESR1], and heat shock protein-70 genes) and enzymes activity (ethoxy-resorufin O-deethylase and glutathione S-transferase [GST]). Plastic debris was found in 29 % of the birds. The transcription of UGT1 and CYP1A5 was significantly associated with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and PCBs levels. ESR1 was associated with HCB and Mirex, and GST was associated with Drins and Mirex. While organic pollutants affected shearwaters more than plastic ingestion, reducing plastic availability remains relevant as xenobiotics are also potentially adsorbed onto plastics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) is a problem that is increasingly of concern to global fisheries resources and the aquatic environment. Nearly 2% of all fishing gear used in marine fisheries is lost to the ocean annually. This has negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, which includes but not limited to ghostfishing mortality to commercial, recreational and protected species, degradation of benthic habitat, and change to the ecosystem. Fishing gear left in the sea can drift ashore affecting recreational use of beaches and shorelines and poses hazards to navigation. Most of the research on ALDFG has been in the marine fisheries of the developed world with very few studies in the inland fisheries, mostly in the developing world of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This paper reviews and synthesizes literature about the status of ALDFG in inland fisheries globally. Only 16 studies, between 1970 to 2023, that referenced ALDFG causes, levels, impacts, and preventive measures were found. Thus, this review highlights that ALDFG in inland fisheries remains a highly understudied area of aquatic plastic pollution. Further studies are recommended to fully understand its status, extent, and potential environmental impacts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence of microplastic (MP) pollution in the global marine environment and these pollutants have been found to contaminate even remote regions, including the Southern Ocean south of the polar front. Previous studies in this region have mostly focused on MPs larger than 300 μm, potentially underestimating the extent of MP pollution. This study is the first to investigate MPs in marine surface waters south of the polar front, with a focus on small MPs 500–11 μm in size. Seventeen surface water samples were collected in the southern Weddell Sea using an in-house-designed sampling system. The analysis of the entire sample using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (μFTIR) with focal plane array (FPA) detection revealed the presence of MPs in all samples, with the vast majority of the MPs detected being smaller than 300 μm (98.3 %). The mean concentration reached 43.5 (± 83.8) MPs m−3, with a wide range from 0.5 to 267.2 MPs m−3. The samples with the highest concentrations differed from the other samples in that they were collected north of the continental slope and the Antarctic Slope Current. Sea ice conditions possibly also influenced these varying concentrations. This study reports high concentrations of MPs compared to other studies in the region. It emphasizes the need to analyze small MPs, down to a size of 11 μm or even smaller, in the Antarctic Treaty Area to gain a more comprehensive understanding of MP pollution and its potential ecological impacts. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Marine pollution by various debris is rising in the context of increasing urbanization, industrialization and worldwide trade. Here, we review marine macro-litter with focus on sources, abundance, distribution, and impact on aquatic wildlife, human health, and the economy. We observe that about 75–80% of marine litter originates from land-based sources, including poorly managed landfills and improper disposal. Macro-litter ingestion by marine life is of growing concern, in particular concerning the presence of plastics and associated pollutants, e.g., bisphenol A and phthalates, in fishes. These pollutants are accumulated and transferred to human via seafood. Marine plastic pollution induces a substantial rise of economic costs due to the decline of ecosystem services. Mitigation of marine plastic pollution should be done by following the ten Rs principles of refuse, rethink, reduce, re-use, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Mangroves are crucial ecosystems that play a role in carbon sequestration, shoreline fortification, and provide habitats for diverse species. In developing nations like India, there is a need for more knowledge on the occurrence and distribution of MPs in mangrove forests under changing seasons. Our investigation aimed to fulfil this research gap by studying the seasonal patterns of microplastic distribution within the sediments of the Kota mangroves in south-western India. The mean (± standard deviation) microplastic abundance was 1418.52 (±1404.34) MPs/kg during the wet season and 1414.32 (±1368.65) MPs/kg during the dry season. A consistent pattern in microplastic categories was observed, with fibres being the predominant shape followed by film, fragment, and foam. Microplastics of size 0.1–0.3mm were dominant in all seasons. Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and Raman Spectroscopy analyses revealed the presence of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy between control and extracted samples revealed adsorption of Cd, Zn, Pb, Fe, and Ni onto the extracted microplastics. The primary contributors to the MP pollution were attributed to fishing related activities, fish meal processing industry, tourism, and local households. This study established a baseline information on the seasonal dynamics governing the distribution of microplastics in sediment of Kota mangroves. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The global plastic production has steadily increased from 1.7 million tons in 1950 to over 400 million tons in 2022, with about 60% of plastic ultimately ending up in landfills and oceans. There is also growing evidence that microplastics exert negative effects on biota and ecosystems. Biodegradable plastics may represent a safe alternative, yet their potential adverse effects have not been comprehensively analyzed. Here, we reviewed biodegradable plastics, with focus on their conversion into microplastics, their interactions with pollutants, and their combined toxicity for aquatic biota. Biodegradable plastics include polylactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, polybutylene succinate, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), and poly(ε-caprolactone). We found that some biobased plastics are hardly biodegradable. Some biobased plastics are compostable but require specific environmental conditions for their biodegradation. Biobased plastics can generate microplastics when released into the environment, which can impact biota. Contrary to the common public belief, biodegradable plastics may not only originate from biosources but can be synthesized from fossil fuels. Microplastics originating from biodegradable plastics can interact with pollutants, adsorbing and transporting these pollutants, resulting in synergistic or antagonistic effects on exposed organisms. Biofilm formation on microplastics impacts their degradation and pollutant interactions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " The accumulation of plastic waste in ocean environments is a critical ecological issue impacting marine wildlife and human health. This study assesses the presence of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish from Al-Hoceima Bay, a key part of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem. Using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, we analyzed 90 individuals from two different species, finding that 33% of the examined fish contained microplastics. Specific occurrences were 26% in mackerel and 40% in gilthead sea bream. These findings highlight significant contamination even in commercial fishing areas, raising urgent questions about the long-term ecological effects and health risks. Therefore, the need for effective plastic waste management policies is critical to protect our marine ecosystems and food safety.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2024.,\n",
       " Micro-nano plastics (MNPs; size <5 mm), ubiquitous and emerging pollutants, accumulated in the natural environment through various sources, and are likely to interact with nutrients, thereby influencing their biogeochemical cycle. Increasing scientific evidences reveal that MNPs can affect nitrogen (N) cycle processes by affecting biotopes and organisms in the environmental matrix and MNPs biofilms, thus plays a crucial role in nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) emission. Yet, the mechanism and key processes behind this have not been systematically reviewed in natural environments. In this review, we systematically summarize the effects of MNPs on N transformation in terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric ecosystems. The effects of MNPs properties on N content, composition, and function of the microbial community, enzyme activity, gene abundance and plant N uptake in different environmental conditions has been briefly discussed. The review highlights the significant potential of MNPs to alter the properties of the environmental matrix, microbes and plant or animal physiology, resulting in changes in N uptake and metabolic efficiency in plants, thereby inhibiting organic nitrogen (ON) formation and reducing N bioavailability, or altering NH3 emissions from animal sources. The faster the decomposition of plastics, the more intense the perturbation of MNPs to organisms in the natural ecosystem. Findings of this provide a more comprehensive analysis and research directions to the environmentalists, policy makers, water resources planners & managers, biologists, and biotechnologists to do integrate approaches to reach the practical engineering solutions which will further diminish the long-term ecological and climatic risks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution has become increasingly serious in recent years. As a common plastic, polyurethane waste cannot be ignored for its environmental pollution. Compared with landfilling, incineration, and various physical or chemical recovery methods, biological treatment is considered as the most environmentally friendly method, and microbial degradation of plastics is currently a research hotspot. In this study, a marine fungus Hortaea werneckii 13 was isolated from the deep-sea sediment of the Pacific Ocean, which can degrade waterborne polyurethane Impranil DLN. ATR-FTIR and GC-MS analysis indicated that the fungus degraded Impranil DLN by breaking the ester bond in the polyol group and the urea bond in the urethane group. In addition, H. werneckii 13 can also utilize solid polyurethane as the sole carbon source for growth and cause significant weight loss and erosion of polyester polyurethane films. The results indicate that the marine fungus H. werneckii 13 poses significant application potential in the biodegradation and harmless treatment of the polyurethane waste. © 2024 Institute of Microbiology, CAS.

       " Till now, microplastics/nano-plastics(M/NPs) have received a lot of attention as emerging contaminant. As a typical but complex porous medium, soil is not only a large reservoir of M/NPs but also a gateway for M/NPs to enter groundwater. Therefore, the review of the factors controlling the transport behavior of M/NPs in porous media can provide important guidance for the risk assessment of M/NPs in soil and groundwater. In this study, the key factors controlling the transport behavior of M/NPs in porous media are systematically divided into three groups: (1) nature of M/NPs affecting M/NPs transport in porous media, (2) nature of flow affecting M/NPs transport in porous media, (3) nature of porous media affecting M/NPs transport. In each group, the specific control factors for M/NPs transport in porous media are discussed in detail. In addition to the above factors, some substances (colloids or pollutants) present in natural porous media (such as soil or sediments) will co-transport with M/NPs and affect its mobility. According to the different properties of co-transported substances, the mechanism of promoting or inhibiting the migration behavior of M/NPs in porous media was discussed. Finally, the limitations and future research directions of M/NPs transport in porous media are pointed out. This review can provide a useful reference for predicting the transport of M/NPs in natural porous media. © 2024,\n",
       " The coexistence of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals in sediments has caused a potential threat to sediment biota. However, differences in the effects of MPs and heavy metals on microbes and plants in sediments under different sediment conditions remain unclear. Hence, we investigated the influence of polyethylene (PE) and polylactic acid (PLA) MPs on microbial community structure, Pb bioavailability, and wheatgrass traits under sequential incubation of sediments (i.e., flood, drainage, and planting stages). Results showed that the sediment enzyme activities presented a dose-dependent effect of MPs. Besides, 10 % PLA MPs significantly increased the F1 fractions in three stages by 11.13 %, 30.10 %, and 17.26 %, respectively, thus resulting in higher Pb mobility and biotoxicity. MPs altered sediment bacterial composition and structures, and bacterial community differences were evident in different incubation stages. Moreover, the co-exposure of PLA MPs and Pb significantly decreased the shoot length and total biomass of wheatgrass and correspondingly activated the antioxidant enzyme activity. Further correlation analysis demonstrated that community structure induced by MPs was mainly driven by sediment enzyme activity. This study contributes to elucidating the combined effects of MPs and heavy metals on sediment ecosystems under different sediment conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics pose a significant environmental threat, with potential implications for toxic chemical release, aquatic life endangerment, and human food chain contamination. In Asia, rapid economic growth coupled with inadequate waste management has escalated plastic pollution in rivers, positioning them as focal points for environmental concern. Despite Asia's rivers being considered the most polluted with plastics globally, scholarly attention to microplastics in the region's freshwater environments is a recent development. This study undertakes a systematic review of 228 scholarly articles to map microplastic hotspots in Asian freshwater systems and synthesize current research trends within the continent. Findings reveal a concentration of research in China and Japan, primarily investigating riverine and surface waters through net-based sampling methods. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) emerge as the predominant microplastic types, frequently observed as fibers or fragments. However, the diversity of sampling methodologies and reporting metrics complicates data synthesis, underscoring the need for standardized analytical frameworks to facilitate comparative analysis. This paper delineates the distribution of microplastic hotspots and outlines the prevailing challenges and prospects in microplastic research within Asian freshwater contexts. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The rise of plastic production has triggered a surge in plastic waste, overwhelming marine ecosystems with microplastics. The effects of climate change, notably changing salinity, have shaped the dynamics of coastal lagoons. Thus, understanding the combined impact of these phenomena on marine organisms becomes increasingly crucial. To address these knowledge gaps, we investigated for the first time the interactive effects of environmental microplastics (EMPs) and increased salinity on the early development of Mytilus galloprovincialis larvae. Morphological assessments using the larval embryotoxicity test revealed larval anomalies and developmental arrests induced by EMPs and increased salinity. Transcriptomic analyses targeting 12 genes involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis, DNA repair, shell formation, and stress proteins were conducted on D-larvae uncovered the potential effects of EMPs on shell biomineralization, highlighting the role of Histidine Rich Glycoproteine (HRG) and tubulin as crucial adaptive mechanisms in Mytilus sp. in response to environmental shifts. Furthermore, we explored oxidative stress and neurotoxicity using biochemical assays. Our findings revealed a potential interaction between EMPs and increased salinity, impacting multiple physiological processes in mussel larvae. Our data contribute to understanding the cumulative effects of emerging anthropogenic pollutants and environmental stressors, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to assessing their impact on marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a growing concern in soil ecosystems worldwide. The accumulation of (micro)plastic debris leads to a unique microenvironment, termed the “plastisphere.” Notably, the dynamics and behaviors of the soil plastisphere diverge from its marine counterpart, where it is initially defined, thereby likely exhibiting an uncharacterized feature in ecological effects and biogeochemistry. The understanding of the soil plastisphere holds significant implications for environmental science and practical applications in pollution management and agricultural practices. Compared with the oceanic plastisphere, research on the soil plastisphere is still in its infancy with limited but significant studies contributing to current knowledge. A recent seminal work by Rillig et al. (Rillig et al., 2023. Nature Reviews Microbiology. doi:10.1038/s41579-023-00967-2) has inspired us and provided comprehensive insights into the characteristics and function of the soil plastisphere. In this commentary, we present core aspects of the soil plastisphere, encompassing its microbial communities, biogeochemical processes, and ecological implications, as well as highlight current methodologies probing this domain. © 2023, Higher Education Press.,\n",
       " Holothuria atra (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) is a type of invertebrate animal that lives on the bottom of the rocky coast and has the potential as a nutritious food raw material for humans and pharmaceutical raw materials. The study aims to determine the microplastic types, microplastic functional groups and simulate the distribution pattern of ingested microplastics in the digestive system of H. atra based on hydrodynamic activity. Microplastic separation was conducted by extraction using the flotation method based on predetermined criteria. Functional group test of microplastic polymers ingested in intestines of sea cucumbers using FT-IR (Frontier Transform Infrared-Spectroscopy) Analysis. Hydrodynamic modeling analysis used secondary data: bathymetric, currents, wind direction, and tidal prediction data. The results of sampling of H. atra sea cucumbers at four observation locations, where ten individual sea cucumbers were taken from each location, showed that microplastic waste exposed in the intestines of sea cucumbers obtained an average value of 14,166 individuals-1, with a particle length range of 0.214–3.978 mm. The highest abundance was from the type of fiber, followed by fragments, pellets, and films. FTIR test results indicate the presence of several functional microplastic groups that are digested in the intestine, including polyamide (PA)/nylon-6, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). The movement of currents carrying microplastic waste particles is dominated to the west and south of Karimunjawa Island, potentially endangering the habitats of sea cucumbers and other animals in the waters of the surrounding small islands. It is recommended that stakeholders establish plastic waste protocols, waste facilities and treatment, and strict supervision of tourists entering the Karimunjawa tourism environment. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,\n",
       " Microplastics can promote microbial colonisation and biofilm growth, thus being referred to as “plastispheres”. The global plastic pollution surge is likely to adversely impact ecology and human health by providing a novel habitat for microbial communities. Even though microplastics in marine environments have been the subject of in-depth research, plastispheres have recently received attention. Thus, the current study investigates the prevalence and distribution of plastispheres along the Maharashtra coast of India, considering their plausible implications for ecology and human health. Microplastics were isolated from sediment and water samples obtained from 10 sampling sites. Subsequently, these microplastic particles were subjected to ATR-FTIR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses to ascertain their chemical composition, surface topography, and presence of attached biofilms. The predominant polymers composing the microplastic particles were polypropylene (42.8%), polyethylene (28.6%), polystyrene (14.3%), and polyvinyl chloride (14.3%). SEM analysis revealed the presence of topographical structures and degradation effects, facilitating microbial attachment on the microplastic surface. About 50% of the microplastic particles tested positive for biofilms, with over 66% of those collected from Girgaon and Malvan beaches exhibiting biofilm presence. These positively screened particles also displayed comparatively rough surface structures, likely enhancing microbial colonisation. Microplastic ageing and polymer type could positively affect microbial colonisation. Diatoms and fungal hyphae exhibit varied interactions with microplastic polymers. Notably, microplastics host various reproductive stages of fungi, as evidenced by filamentous networks, mycelia, and conidiophores. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Hydroxyl radicals (·OH) generated during the flooding-drought transformation process play a vital role in affecting nutrient cycles at riparian zone. However, information on the processes and mechanisms for ·OH formation under the influence of microplastics (MPs) remains unclear. In this study, the effects of MPs on ·OH production from riparian sediments with different biomass [e.g., vegetation lush (VL) and vegetation barren (VB)] were studied. The results showed that presence of MPs inhibited the production of ·OH by 27 % and 7.5 % for VB and VL sediments, respectively. The inhibition was mainly resulted from the MP-induced reduction of the biotic and abiotic mediated Fe redox processes. Spectral analysis revealed that VL sediments contained more high-molecular-weight humic-like substances. Presence of MPs increased the abundances and activities of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria, which were conducive to the changes in humification and polar properties of organic matters. The reduced humic- and fulvic-like substances were accumulated in the flooding period and substantially oxidized during flooding/drought transformation due to the enhanced MP-mediated electron transfer abilities, thus mitigated the MP-induced inhibition effects. Therefore, in order to better understanding the biogeochemical cycling of contaminants as influenced by ·OH and MPs in river ecosystems, humic substances should be considered systematically. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastic sampling strategies for aquatic systems commonly employ small mesh nets to collect suspended microparticles. These methods work well for marine sampling campaigns; however, complex water systems such as freshwater rivers, effluent discharges, and stormwater ponds characterized by high total suspended solids and fast-moving water can cause the nets to clog, rip, or tear. Published in 2020, ASTM D8332 is an alternative approach to sampling complex water systems for microplastics involving pumping large volumes of water across a cascading stack of sieves to collect suspended particles. Here we show that ASTM D8332 can be applied to sample freshwater rivers for microplastic collection. A high throughput sampling prototype developed in this work is capable of pumping 1500 L of river water in 45 min to collect particles as small as 45 µm. The system is lightweight, modular, and easily transportable. It has a discrete power supply, allowing for the collection of microplastics anywhere along the river, including municipal discharges. The design minimizes the amount of plastic in the flow path and provides a practical way to measure field contamination. Finally, we outline lessons learned through extensive field trials and testing using this system sampling the North Saskatchewan River in Edmonton, Alberta. • Existing small mesh nets face limitations in freshwater rivers, encountering clogging and tearing issues from high suspended solids and fast moving water. • Using a standardized method, ASTM D8332 - a pumping-based approach is efficient for microplastic collection in freshwater rivers. • Lightweight, modular, plastic free prototype system pumps 1500 L of river water in 45 min, collecting particles as small as 45 µm.

       " In-situ underwater observation for marine microplastics (MPs) study has long been desired but challenged by the difficulty in achieving continuous MPs enrichment and MPs analysis in underwater environments. Herein, a novel underwater system for in-situ detection of MPs was introduced. An innovative design with a filter mesh flipped 180° driven by a stepper motor was adopted to ensure the self-cleaning of the filter mesh and continuous MPs enrichment, reducing the frequency of manual maintenance required for the system. A special-designed optical detection chamber based on micro-Raman spectroscopy featured a 13 × 10 mm imaging field of view and a 50 µm imaging resolution was developed to gather morphology and composition information of MPs. During sea trials, the system successfully detected polypropylene (PP) microplastic and other suspended substances in seawater including microalgae, organic substances, and sands. This study lays the groundwork for future research into underwater in-situ investigation of marine MPs pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Although the prevalence of microplastics in the atmosphere has recently received considerable attention, there is little information available regarding the distribution of atmospheric microplastics over oceanic regions. In this study, during the summer and autumn months of 2022, we investigated atmospheric microplastics in four marine regions off the eastern coast of mainland China, namely, the southern, middle, and northern regions of the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea. The abundance of atmospheric microplastics in these regions ranged from 1.65 to 16.80 items/100 m3 during summer and from 0.38 to 14.58 items/100 m3 during autumn, although we detected no significant differences in abundance among these regions. Polyamide, chlorinated polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate were identified as the main types of plastic polymer. On the basis of meteorological data and backward trajectory model analyses, we established that the atmospheric microplastics detected during summer were mainly derived from the adjacent marine atmosphere and that over the continental landmass in the vicinity of the sampling area, whereas microplastics detected during autumn appear to have originated mainly from the northeast of China. By influencing the settlement and migration of microplastics, meteorological factors, such as relative humidity and wind speed, were identified as potential factors determining the distribution and characteristics of the detected microplastics. Our findings in this study, revealing the origin and fate of marine atmospheric microplastics, make an important contribution to our current understanding of the distribution and transmission of microplastics within the surveyed region and potentially worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), serving as carriers, possess a mediating effect on altering antibiotics (ATs) migration, yet this novel effect has not received due attention in the vulnerable hyporheic zones where surface water and groundwater converge. This study collected sediment layers from the typical hyporheic zone of the Weihe River, focusing on oxytetracycline (OTC) detected therein, and employed three types of MPs (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to establish various mediated adsorption systems. Through batch equilibrium adsorption experiments, morphological and spectroscopic characterizations combined with the impact of external environmental factors, the changes in OTC adsorption characteristics and the interactions before and after MPs mediation were systematically examined. The results indicate that MPs-mediated adsorption led to the formation of a rough, porous amorphous structure on the sediment surface, with potential internal hydrogen bonds. This exhibited an additional micropore diffusion step that delayed the adsorption kinetics equilibrium time, increased the isothermal maximum adsorption capacity along with desorption hysteresis effects, shifted thermodynamic enthalpy from physically dominated to semi-chemical adsorption participation, and resulted in an increased tendency towards disorder in entropy. The pH, ionic strength, and aging of MPs all affect the charge balance within the adsorption system, while MPs, OTC, and sediments can interact through the negative-charge-assisted hydrogen bond ((−)CAHB). The mediating effect of MPs stems from their role as receptors, facilitating the formation of (−)CAHB and thus crosslinking an amorphous structure available for OTC micropore filling. Compared to PE and PP, PMMA provides receptors through an additional free radical pathway, hence possessing a stronger mediating effect. These findings contribute to reevaluating the environmental fate of ATs and MPs from a new perspective, offering theoretical references for risk assessment and management of emerging pollutants. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are now a growing environmental and public health issue, as they are detected pervasively in freshwater and marine environments, ingested by organisms, and then enter the human body. Industrial development drives this environmental burden caused by MP formation and human uptake by elevating plastic pollution levels and shaping the domestic dietary structure. We map the MP human uptake across 109 global countries on five continents from 1990 to 2018, focusing on the world’s major coastlines that are affected by plastic pollution that affects the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Amid rapid industrial growth, Indonesia tops the global per capita MP dietary intake at 15 g monthly. In Asian, African, and American countries, including China and the United States, airborne and dietary MP uptake increased over 6-fold from 1990 to 2018. Eradicating 90% of global aquatic plastic debris can help decrease MP uptake by more than 48% in Southeast Asian countries that peak MP uptake. To reduce MP uptake and potential public health risks, governments in developing and industrialized countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North and South America should incentivize the removal of free plastic debris from freshwater and saltwater environments through advanced water treatment and effective solid waste management practices. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Industrial mariculture, a vital means of providing high quality protein to humans, is a potential source of microplastics (MPs) which have recently received increasing attention. This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in feed, source water and recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) with long & short operating times as well as in fish from typical industrial mariculture farms in China. Results showed that microplastics occurred in all samples with the average concentration of 3.53 ± 1.39 particles/g, 0.70 ± 0.17 particles/L, 1.53 ± 0.21 particles/L and 2.21 ± 0.62 particles/individual for feed, source water, RAS and fish, respectively. Microplastics were mainly fiber in shape, blue in color and 20–500 μm in size. Compared with short operated RAS, long operating time led to higher microplastic concentration in RAS, especially that of microplastic in 20–500 μm, granular and blue. Regardless of short or long operating time, microplastics in RAS mainly gathered in culture tank, tank before microfilter and fixed-bed biological filter, and the microfilter removed efficiently the microplastic with the shape of film, granule, fragment as well as those with size > 1000 μm. As for the polymer types, polyamide (PA, 71.9 %) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 65.7 %) dominated in feed and source water, respectively, which may be the reason for the high proportion of PA (38.8 % and 26.4 %) and PET (31.8 % and 30.2 %) in RAS and fish. In addition, polypropylene (PP) was also detected in RAS (18.7 %) and fish (22.6 %), indicating that other plastic facilities such as PP brush carrier also made a contribution. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model revealed three sources of MP in RAS, namely plastic facilities, industrial sewage and plastic packaging products. Our results provided a theoretical basis for the management of MP in RAS. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study investigated the photo-oxidative degradation and biodegradation behavior of poly(ether-block-amide) (PEBA) multiblock copolymers with varying amide segments and polyethylene glycol (PEG) contents. The copolymer films were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light in an artificial weathering machine to simulate the photo-oxidative degradation of these polymers in the environment. The biodegradation behavior of both the original and UV-exposed PEBA multiblock copolymer films was studied by immersing them in extracted seawater for 28 d. The degree of biodegradation was evaluated on the basis of the amount of carbon dioxide generated. The changes in the morphology, chemical structure, mechanical properties, molar mass, and microstructure of the PEBA multiblock copolymer films after UV exposure and biodegradation tests were investigated using laser microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile testing, nanoindentation, size-exclusion chromatography, and wide-angle X-ray scattering. The PEBA multiblock copolymer with a higher PEG content exhibited faster photo-oxidative degradation under UV exposure, whereas the nylon-6-segmented PEBA multiblock copolymer demonstrated excellent biodegradability. Furthermore, the biodegradability of the PEBA multiblock copolymers significantly improved after UV exposure. The biodegradability of the PEBA multiblock copolymers was confirmed through field tests conducted in Ainan, Ehime, Japan. It was observed that a nylon-6-segmented PEBA multiblock copolymer containing 56 wt % PEG underwent complete degradation in the marine environment after six months. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of biodegradable polymers to alleviate microplastic pollution in the environment. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " This study investigated the leaching of phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizers from polyvinyl chloride microplastics (MPs) into sediment and their degradation over a 30-d period via abiotic and biotic processes. The results showed that 35–79% of plasticizers were released into the sediment from the MPs and > 99.9% degradation was achieved. Although a significantly higher degradation was found in plasticizer-added microcosms under biotic processes (overall, 94%), there was a noticeable abiotic loss (72%), suggesting that abiotic processes also play a role in plasticizer degradation. Interestingly, when compared with the initial sediment-water partitioning for plasticizers, the partition constants for low-molecular-weight compounds decreased in both microcosms, whereas those for high-molecular-weight compounds increased after abiotic degradation. Furthermore, changes in the bacterial community, abundance of plasticizer-degrading bacterial populations, and functional gene profiles were assessed. In all the microcosms, a decrease in bacterial community diversity and a notable shift in bacterial composition were observed. The enriched potential plasticizer-degrading bacteria were Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Desulfovibrio, Desulfuromonas, Devosia, Gordonia, Mycobacterium, and Sphingomonas, among which Bacillus was recognized as the key plasticizer degrader. Overall, these findings shed light on the factors affecting plasticizer degradation, the microbial communities potentially involved in biodegradation, and the fate of plasticizers in the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " As plastic pollution is increasing rapidly, novel forms of plastic litter have been lately described. One of most recently described type of plastic litter is pyroplastic, i.e. an amorphous matrix derived from the burning of manufactured plastics. We surveyed 12 locations along northern French shores where mussel reefs are a predominant feature. We recorded pyroplastic items at six sites (average weight of 3.34g) mainly made of polyethylene. We then tested the effects of exposure to raw and beached pyroplastic leachates on adaptive behavioural traits of the mussel Mytilus edulis, a key ecosystem engineer. The ability of mussels to move and aggregate were significantly affected by pyroplastic leachates, particularly those from beached pyroplastics. Additionally, the strength of the effects was polymer-dependent, with PE having a more pronounced effects than PP. Our results provide the first evidence that pyroplastics have more severe impacts on living organisms than those triggered by non-burnt plastics. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Despite both microplastics (MPs) and harmful algae blooms (HABs) may pose a severe threat to the immunity of marine bivalves, the toxification mechanism underlying is far from being fully understood. In addition, owing to the prevalence and sudden occurrence characteristics of MPs and HABs, respectively, bivalves with MP-exposure experience may face acute challenge of harmful algae under realistic scenarios. However, little is known about the impacts and underlying mechanisms of MP-exposure experience on the susceptibility of immunity to HABs in bivalve mollusks. Taking polystyrene MPs and diarrhetic shellfish toxin-producing Prorocentrum lima as representatives, the impacts of MP-exposure on immunity vulnerability to HABs were investigated in the thick-shell mussel, Mytilus coruscus. Our results revealed evident immunotoxicity of MPs and P. lima to the mussel, as evidenced by significantly impaired total count, phagocytic activity, and cell viability of haemocytes, which may result from the induction of oxidative stress, aggravation of haemocyte apoptosis, and shortage in cellular energy supply. Moreover, marked disruptions of immunity, antioxidant system, apoptosis regulation, and metabolism upon MPs and P. lima exposure were illustrated by gene expression and comparative metabolomic analyses. Furthermore, the mussels that experienced MP-exposure were shown to be more vulnerable to P. lima, indicated by greater degree of deleterious effects on abovementioned parameters detected. In general, our findings emphasize the threat of MPs and HABs to bivalve species, which deserves close attention and more investigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The recovery phase of mangrove seedlings in coastal wetland ecosystems can be negatively affected by exposure to external pollutants. This study aimed to investigate the impact of microplastics (MPs) influx, specifically polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), on the growth of Aegiceras corniculatum seedlings and their accumulation of heavy metals (HMs). PS and PMMA significantly increased HMs accumulation (up to 21.0–548%), particularly in the roots of seedlings, compared to the control treatment (CK). Additionally, elevated activities of malondialdehyde and catalase enzymes were observed in the leaves of seedlings, while peroxidase enzyme activity decreased. Topological analysis of the root sediment microbiota coexistence network revealed that the modularization data increased from 0.69 (CK treatment) to 1.07 (PS treatment) and 5.11 (PMMA treatment) under the combined stress of MPs and HMs. This suggests that the introduction of MPs intensifies microbial modularization. The primary cause of increased HMs accumulation in plants is the MPs input, which influences the secretion of organic acids by plants and facilitates the shift of HMs in sediment to bioavailable states. Furthermore, changes in microbial clustering may also contribute to the elevated HMs accumulation in plants. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of external pollutants on mangrove seedlings and offers new perspectives for the preservation and restoration of mangrove coastal wetlands. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " One of the main problems of the world's oceans, reported by many scientific studies, is the microplastic pollution. Within the Black Sea, one of the main sources of pollution is the same, which is caused by the diverse anthropogenic activities. The present study demonstrated detailed microplastics contamination of in five fish species important for the commercial fishing (Garfish, Мullet, Knout goby, Pontic shad and Mediterranean horse mackerel). They were collected from the Sozopol area on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. Within each microplastic morphological group, three size classes were recognised: 100–200 µm, 25–100 µm and ≤ 25 µm. Microplastics were found in all studied tissues of the fish, but in varying proportions of pellets, fibres and fragments. Pellets were most frequently isolated, followed by irregularly-shaped fragments and fibres were the least numerous. The bulk of insulated plastics are made of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Our results pointed out serious pollution with plastic particles in the Bulgarian Black Sea aquatory, which, in the future, may seriously affect the health of the fish population and also human health. © Stephany Toschkova et al.,\n",
       " Study region: Indian inland aquatic ecosystems. Study focus: Microplastics (MPs) have been identified as emerging contaminants, potentially impacting public and ecosystem health. This comprehensive review discusses the current state of knowledge on MP contamination and mechanistic process understanding in Indian inland aquatic ecosystems. It highlights knowledge gaps regarding current MP data and discusses methodological differences in MP sampling and sample processing that can lead to contrasting results. New hydrological insight for the region: Most studies reviewed here have provided evidence of MP contamination in water, sediment and certain indicator species of inland aquatic ecosystems at specific locations and times. Significant seasonal variations in MP concentrations have been identified for pre-, during and post-monsoon periods. We found that only a few of the reviewed studies have considered the inherent spatio-temporal variability of MP concentrations, and the intricate interplay with hydrological key parameters has largely been overlooked. However, in order to improve our understanding of how MPs are transported within these aquatic ecosystems (e.g., river networks) and decide on potential pollution mitigation, it is imperative to link data on MP concentration and physico-chemical characteristics with key hydrological information such as flow velocity or discharge. This will provide information on MP loads and help to establish loading functions for these aquatic ecosystems that are needed to better understand the impacts of MP pollution on public and ecosystem health. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Nanoplastics and engineering nanomaterials (ENMs) are contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), increasingly being detected in the marine environment and recognized as a potential threat for marine biota at the global level including in polar areas. Few studies have assessed the impact of these anthropogenic nanoparticles in the microbiome of marine invertebrates, however combined exposure resembling natural scenarios has been overlooked. The present study aimed to evaluate the single and combined effects of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NP) as proxy for nanoplastics and nanoscale titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) on the prokaryotic communities associated with the gill tissue of the Antarctic soft-shell clam Laternula elliptica, a keystone species of marine benthos Wild-caught specimens were exposed to two environmentally relevant concentrations of carboxylated PS NP (PS–COOH NP, ∼62 nm size) and nano-TiO2 (Aeroxide P25, ∼25 nm) as 5 and 50 μg/L either single and combined for 96h in a semi-static condition.Our findings show a shift in microbiome composition in gills of soft-shell clams exposed to PS NP and nano-TiO2 either alone and in combination with a decrease in the relative abundance of OTU1 (Spirochaetaceae). In addition, an increase of gammaproteobacterial OTUs affiliated to MBAE14 and Methylophagaceae (involved in ammonia denitrification and associated with low-quality water), and the OTU Colwellia rossensis (previously recorded in polluted waters) was observed. Our results suggest that nanoplastics and nano-TiO2 alone and in combination induce alterations in microbiome composition by promoting the increase of negative taxa over beneficial ones in the gills of the Antarctic soft-shell clam. An increase of two low abundance OTUs in PS-COOH NPs exposed clams was also observed. A predicted gene function analysis revealed that sugar, lipid, protein and DNA metabolism were the main functions affected by either PS-COOH NP and nano-TiO2 exposure. The molecular functions involved in the altered affiliated OTUs are novel for nano-CEC exposures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Nanoplastics pollution is a growing environmental problem worldwide. Recent research has demonstrated the toxic effects of nanoplastics on various marine organisms. However, the influences of nanoplastics on marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, a critical nitrogen source in the ocean, remained unknown. Here, we report that nanoplastics exposure significantly reduced growth, photosynthetic, and nitrogen fixation rates of Crocosphaera watsonii (a major marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that nanoplastics might harm C. watsonii via downregulation of photosynthetic pathways and DNA damage repair genes, while genes for respiration, cell damage, nitrogen limitation, and iron (and phosphorus) scavenging were upregulated. The number and size of starch grains and electron-dense vacuoles increased significantly after nanoplastics exposure, suggesting that C. watsonii allocated more resources to storage instead of growth under stress. We propose that nanoplastics can damage the cell (e.g., DNA, cell membrane, and membrane-bound transporters), inhibit nitrogen and carbon fixation, and hence lead to nutrient limitation and impaired growth. Our findings suggest the possibility that nanoplastics pollution could reduce the new nitrogen input and hence affect the productivity in the ocean. The impact of nanoplastics on marine nitrogen fixation and productivity should be considered when predicting the ecosystem response and biogeochemical cycling in the changing ocean. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Nowadays microplastics have become a significant environmental concern, impacting both freshwater and marine ecosystems. In response to this issue, extensive research has been conducted to explore methods for separating microplastics from water. One area of investigation involves the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to study hydrocyclones and their intricate flow patterns. In this study, CFD was systematically used to examine various hydrocyclone designs with different geometrical parameters, including the ratios of cylindrical diameter to underflow diameter and overflow diameter, the cone to cylindrical height ratio, and the inlet angle. The efficiency of these hydrocyclones has been evaluated based on key performance metrics, including microplastics recovery percentage, water split percentage, and pressure drop. The results of this study have revealed noteworthy findings. Moreover, statistical analysis, specifically the analysis of variance (ANOVA), was employed to determine the significance of various geometric parameters on microplastics separation within the hydrocyclone. As a result of this comprehensive investigation, an optimized hydrocyclone design was proposed. This optimized hydrocyclone featured an underflow diameter to diameter of the cylindrical ratio of 0.264, an overflow diameter to diameter of the cylindrical ratio of 0.3, a cone to cylindrical height ratio of 13.22:70.78, and a tangential inlet. This configuration achieved a remarkable 76% microplastics recovery, a 52% water split, and a pressure drop of 82,340 Pa. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Information on sedimentary microplastics and phthalates has been restricted to the coastal regions of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Makran. Our basin-wide study monitored their levels, spatial behaviors, and potential risks using GIS-based techniques. Microplastics and phthalates ranged from 5 to 75 particles/kg d.w and 0.004–1.219 μg g−1 d.w, respectively. Microplastics were in the size category of 100 μm to 3 mm, and black microfibers (< 1 mm) and high-density polymers were dominant. The total number of microplastics was between 356.333 × 1012 and 469.075 × 1012 particles in the surface sediments of the studied regions (confidence interval = 99 %). Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and Di-isobutyl phthalate contributed 88 % of detected phthalates. Significant correlations among microplastic abundance, total phthalates, and DEHP were distinguished (p < 0.05). Overall, the findings reiterated the widespread presence of microplastics and a potential link between phthalates and microplastics. Semi-variogram, cluster Voronoi polygons, and Trend analysis identified spatial outliers and major deposition sites of microplastics and phthalates and consequently outlined the localities where upcoming studies should be concentrated. A hotspot of potential risks was marked using Fuzzy logic and GIS-based algorithms in the Sea of Makran, covering an area equal to 342. 99 km2. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Cagarras Islands Archipelago, a no-take MPA in Southeast Brazil, was designated as Natural Monument (MONA Cagarras) and, more recently, recognized as Hope Spot for biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to assess plastic contamination by analyzing marine litter and microplastics in MONA Cagarras and surrounding waters. Marine litter (34.12 kg) was caught by artisanal fishermen in MONA Cagarras proximities, and plastics represented ∼79 %. Personal hygiene items and strains of hair were found, suggesting sewage-derived contamination from Ipanema SSO. Microplastics were detected in MONA Cagarras surface waters. Fragments and black particle were the most frequently found microplastic shape and color, respectively. μ-FTIR analysis identified, in descending order of occurrence, polystyrene-PS, polyethylene-PE, polyvinyl chloride-PVC, polypropylene-P, and polyamide-PA. Our integrated results of macro and microplastic contamination highlight an issue of effective conservation and health of marine biodiversity in MONA Cagarras and surrounding waters and a concern for better management of Brazilian MPAs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Size spectra analysis has been widely used to study pelagic ecosystems worldwide. It has a solid theoretical and empirical basis and can be used to provide useful information on ecosystem structure and trophic efficiency. The objective of this study was to obtain complete Normalized Biovolume Size Spectra (NBSS), including zooplankton, microplastics, and other suspended particles, along an estuary-shelf gradient. Plankton net samples (300 μm mesh) were obtained in the Rio Formoso Estuary, in Tamandaré Bay and on the continental shelf off Tamandaré, Brazil, during two years (from April/2013 to May/2015). Particles were identified by image analysis (ZooScan) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Generally, NBSS slopes were close to −1 (i.e., between −1.09 and −0.85), except for NBSSz (zooplankton only) in the Estuary (−1.59) and in the Bay (−1.44), where the steepest slopes were observed, due to the importance of small-sized zooplankton in these areas. The NBSSz slope was significantly steeper in the Estuary and in the Bay than on the Shelf. The inclusion of particles into the NBSS (NBSSp) turned the slope significantly less steep in the Estuary and in the Bay. Intercepts were significantly higher in the Estuary than in the other areas, after including particles in the analysis (NBSSp), due to the extremely high total volume of biogenic particles in the estuary. The most relevant impacts of microplastics were detected within the larger size classes (> 2.60 mm Feret length, > 0.58 log10 mm3). In the Estuary, large-sized microplastics were similarly important (in terms of volume) as zooplankton. Large-sized polyethylene and polypropylene were more relevant in the Bay, large-sized nylon fibers on the Shelf (in the rainy season). The present study, a pioneering effort towards a synthetic analysis of zooplankton, microplastics, and other particles, highlights the importance of including non-living particles in size-based studies and ecosystem models. © 2024,\n",
       " In excess of 13,000 chemicals are added to plastics (‘additives’) to improve performance, durability, and production of plastic products. They are categorized into numerous chemical classes including flame retardants, light stabilizers, antioxidants, and plasticizers. While research on plastic additives in the marine environment has increased over the past decade, there is a lack of methodological standardization. To direct future measurement of plastic additives, we compiled a first-of-its-kind dataset of literature assessing plastic additives in marine environments, delineated by sample type (plastic debris, seawater, sediment, biota). Using this dataset, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the state of the science. Currently, our dataset includes 217 publications published between 1978 and May 2023. The majority of publications analyzed plastic additives in biota collected from Europe and Asia. Analyses concentrated on plasticizers, brominated flame retardants, and bisphenols. Common sample preparation techniques included Solvent - Agitation extraction for plastic, sediment, and biota samples, and Solid Phase Extraction for seawater samples with dichloromethane and solvent mixtures including dichloromethane as the organic extraction solvent. Finally, most analyses were performed utilizing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. There are a variety of data gaps illuminated by this meta-analysis, most notably the small number of compounds that have been targeted for detection compared to the large number of additives used in plastic production. The provided dataset facilitates future investigation of trends in plastic additive concentration data in the marine environment (allowing for comparison to toxicity thresholds) and acts as a starting point for optimizing and harmonizing plastic additive analytical methods. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The East Pacific (EP) region, especially the central and southern EP, has been fairly less studied than other world's regions with respect to marine litter pollution. This comprehensive literature review (257 peer-reviewed publications) showed that both macrolitter (mostly plastics) and microplastics tend to accumulate on EP shorelines. Moreover, they were also reported in all the other compartments investigated: sea surface, water column, seafloor and ‘others’. Mostly local, land-based sources (e.g., tourism, poor waste management) were identified across the region, especially at continental sites from low and mid latitudes. Some sea-based sources (e.g., fisheries, long-distance drifting) were also identified at high latitudes and on oceanic islands, likely enhanced by the oceanographic dynamics of the EP that affect transport of floating litter. Our results suggest that effective solutions to the problem require local and preventive strategies to significantly reduce the levels of litter along the EP coasts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Freshwater ecosystems are viewed as a key medium for the transport of land-based plastics into oceans. Microplastic (MP) particles in freshwater environments demonstrate high persistence and an extensive range of size and shape distributions, which make their mobility, distribution, and fate vary distinctly depending on the prevailing environmental conditions. The inherent physical properties of different plastic polymers are constantly evolving at different specific reaction rates due to the complex weathering processes in the environment. This continuously alters the underlying mechanisms governing MP dynamics and further complicates their ultimate fate in natural aquatic systems. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the dynamic behaviour of MPs in freshwater ecosystems, focusing on investigating the settling, aggregation, retention, and suspension processes governing their transport from the source to the sink. We provide an in-depth overview of the key theoretical foundations of MP behaviour in ambient flows and the key influential factors (i.e. size, density, shape, composition). Our findings highlight intricate interplays between MP dynamic behaviours and local hydrodynamics and water chemistry, which lead to the continuous evolution of MP physicochemical properties (e.g., size, surface charge) through interactions with suspended solids, organic natural matter, and microorganisms under light and wind exposure. This dynamic poses significant challenges in predicting MP transport processes and ultimate fate. Gap analysis highlights the discrepancy between current models based on controlled laboratory conditions and complex natural environments, signifying the need for investigating MP dynamic behaviour across a wide range of environmental conditions (e.g. simulating complex flow patterns and solution chemistries of real water bodies). Further research is needed to expand field studies to correlate environment hydrodynamics with MP abundance and to conduct mesoscale experiments that accurately reflect the effects of weathering and flow hydrodynamics on MP behaviours. Integrating detailed physical experiments with numerical modelling tools is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the interactions among various MPs and their overall impact on the environment. This facilitates robust and reliable environmental risk assessment for MP control and pollution management. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " The billions of tons of plastic released into the environment mostly fragment into smaller particles that reach rivers and oceans, posing toxicity risks to aquatic organisms. As fish serve as excellent environmental indicator organisms, this study aims to comprehensively review and quantify published data regarding the abundance of microplastics (MPs) ingested by fish through scientometric analysis. Systematic analysis reveals that global aquatic ecosystems are contaminated by MPs, with the characteristics of these contaminants stemming from inadequate disposal management practices. The abundance of MPs was recorded in several fish species, notably Cyprinus carpio in natural environments and Danio rerio in controlled environments. According to the surveyed studies, laboratory experiments do not accurately represent the conditions found in natural environments. The results suggest that, in natural environments, the predominant colors of MPs are blue, black, and red. Fibers emerged as the most prevalent type, with polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) being the most frequently identified chemical compositions. On the other hand, laboratory studies showed that the spheres and fragments ingested were predominantly polystyrene (PS) green, followed by the colors blue and red. This discrepancy complicates drawing accurate conclusions regarding the actual effects of plastic particles on aquatic biota. Given the enduring presence of plastic in the environment, it is imperative to consider and implement environmental monitoring for effective, long-term management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " About 3 billion new tires are produced each year and about 800 million tires become waste annually. Global dependence upon tires produced from natural rubber and petroleum-based compounds represents a persistent and complex environmental problem with only partial and often-times, ineffective solutions. Tire emissions may be in the form of whole tires, tire particles, and chemical compounds, each of which is transported through various atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic routes in the natural and built environments. Production and use of tires generates multiple heavy metals, plastics, PAH's, and other compounds that can be toxic alone or as chemical cocktails. Used tires require storage space, are energy intensive to recycle, and generally have few post-wear uses that are not also potential sources of pollutants (e.g., crumb rubber, pavements, burning). Tire particles emitted during use are a major component of microplastics in urban runoff and a source of unique and highly potent toxic substances. Thus, tires represent a ubiquitous and complex pollutant that requires a comprehensive examination to develop effective management and remediation. We approach the issue of tire pollution holistically by examining the life cycle of tires across production, emissions, recycling, and disposal. In this paper, we synthesize recent research and data about the environmental and human health risks associated with the production, use, and disposal of tires and discuss gaps in our knowledge about fate and transport, as well as the toxicology of tire particles and chemical leachates. We examine potential management and remediation approaches for addressing exposure risks across the life cycle of tires. We consider tires as pollutants across three levels: tires in their whole state, as particulates, and as a mixture of chemical cocktails. Finally, we discuss information gaps in our understanding of tires as a pollutant and outline key questions to improve our knowledge and ability to manage and remediate tire pollution. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics, plastic particles 5 mm or less in size, are abundant in the environment; hence, the exposure of humans to microplastics is a great concern. Usually, the surface of microplastics found in the environment has undergone degradation by external factors such as ultraviolet rays and water waves. One of the characteristics of changes caused by surface degradation of microplastics is the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups. Surface degradation alters the physicochemical properties of plastics, suggesting that the biological effects of environmentally degraded plastics may differ from those of pure plastics. However, the biological effects of plastics introduced with oxygen-containing functional groups through degradation are poorly elucidated owing to the lack of a plastic sample that imitates the degradation state of plastics found in the environment. In this study, we investigated the degradation state of microplastics collected from a beach. Next, we degraded a commercially available polyethylene (PE) particles via vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation and showed that chemical surface state of PE imitates that of microplastics in the environment. We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of degraded PE samples on immune and epithelial cell lines. We found that VUV irradiation was effective in degrading PE within a short period, and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was induced by degraded PE in all cell lines. Our results indicate that the cytotoxic effect of PE on different cell types depends on the degree of microplastic degradation, which contributes to our understanding of the effects of PE microplastics on humans. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastics have formed an indispensable component of virtually every consumer good. However, they have also contributed substantially to contamination of the marine environment. The world lacks a well-meaning effort to curtail plastic waste. The plastic pollution crisis arising from inappropriate disposal or mismanaged plastic wastes has driven strategies to repurpose, reuse, and recycle plastic products. Extensive research is continuing aiming to produce a new generation of plastics that are collectively referred to as bioplastics. Ideally, bioplastics are degraded and utilized by surrounding microorganisms, eliminating them from our environment. However, biodegradable bioplastics are still only a small percentage of the global plastics market, and many bioplastics are not biodegradable. While bioplastics are good for the environment, their position as a singular and credible solution for plastic waste is debated. In addition, there are misunderstandings and misconceptions about their use, leading to lack of consumer awareness and acceptance. Food packaging is currently undergoing rapid change partly due to the commercial manufacturing of bioplastics. In order to better understand the future of bioplastics, this review will assess the drivers, and barriers of bioplastics in the context of food packaging, and the role of bioplastic packaging in the circular economy. The purpose of this review is to provide an industrial and strategic roadmap to guide researchers, plastic experts, policy makers, and regulating bodies in identifying the future development path of bioplastics. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution poses a significant threat to marine ecosystem and seafood safety. However, comprehensive and comparable assessments of MP profiles and their ecological and health in Chinese farming oysters are lacking. This study utilized laser infrared imaging spectrometer (LDIR) to quantify MPs in oysters and its farming seawater at 18 sites along Chinese coastlines. Results revealed a total of 3492 MPs in farmed oysters and seawater, representing 34 MP types, with 20–100 µm MP fragments being the dominant. Polyurethane (PU) emerged as the predominant MP type in oysters, while polysulfones were more commonly detected in seawater. Notably, oysters from the Bohai Sea exhibited a higher abundance of MPs (13.62 ± 2.02 items/g) and estimated daily microplastic intake (EDI, 2.14 ± 0.26 items/g/kg·bw/day), indicating a greater potential health risk in the area. Meanwhile, seawater from the Yellow Sea displayed a higher level (193.0 ± 110.7 items/L), indicating a greater ecological risk in this region. Given the pervasiveness and abundance of PU and its high correlation with other MP types, we proposed PU as a promising indicator for monitoring and assessing the risk MP pollution in mariculture in China. These findings provide valuable insights into the extent and characteristics of MP pollution in farmed oysters and seawater in China. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Although developing countries are huge producers of plastic debris, few studies on MPs in freshwater systems, a major contributor to oceans, have been done. In this investigation, we estimated the abundance, shape, size, and potential sources of MPs in river water and sediments taken from the freshwater of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers in Jamshedpur. Four types of MPs were identified among the analyzed data: fragments, films, foams, and fibers. These MPs were examined using a stereomicroscope and their polymer composition was identified using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The quantitative assessment of our study revealed a mean abundance of MPs 9.55 ± 4.87 items/L (average ± SD, n = 9) in water and 270.88 ± 105.89 items/kg (average ± SD, n = 9) in sediment samples. The morphological distribution of MP particles revealed that fibers account of 44.2 % of MPs particles, followed by film (24.4 %), fragments (20.9 %), and pellets/foam (10.5 %) in water. Fiber accounts 48.3 % of total MPs shape followed by fragments (20.6 %), foam/pellets (16.4 %) and film (14.7 %) in sediments. According to the MP size distribution, 84.9 % of the MPs were between <125 μm and 1000 μm in water, while 94.0 % of the particles were between 125 μm and 5000 μm. The black color MPs accounted for 27. 0 % in water and 20.0 % in sediments, followed by blue (24.0 %), and white (19.0 %) in water and sediments, respectively. The most abundant polymer composition found was 30.0 % and 28.2 % of polyester in water and sediment samples respectively, which was followed by polypropylene 37.7 %, polyvinyl chloride 36.2 %, polyethylene 29.7 %, polystyrene 25.1 %, and polyamide 13.1 % in water and sediments.

       " We evaluate the frequency of flipper amputation and its impact on reproduction in the threatened loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) population of the Eastern Atlantic, through a long-term study on several high-density nesting beaches of Cabo Verde. 5982 adult females were individually identified, tagged and measured, and the presence of limb amputations was recorded. 918 of them had one or multiple amputations of the rear or front flippers. Most of these turtles (n = 778) had partial rather than complete flipper amputations. However, we found no difference in body condition indices (1.2 vs. 1.1), clutch size (82 vs. 83 eggs), or hatching success (79 vs. 80%) between amputated and non-amputated females. While amputations may cause individual mortality or reduced fitness, our results indicate that some amputated turtles successfully nest and survive across multiple nesting seasons. Moreover, the amputations do not appear to be impacting the strong recovery of this population. This study provides evidence of the successful reproductive capacity of amputated loggerhead sea turtles and, by extension, the potential reproductive success of amputees released from recovery centers. © 2023 The Authors.

       " Microplastics, pervasive pollutants in aquatic environments, have been primarily studied for their impact on marine ecosystems. However, their effects on freshwater systems, particularly in forested phytotelmata habitats, remain understudied in Subtropical systems. This research examines the influence of varying microplastic concentrations (0.0, 200, 2,000, 20,000, and 200,000 ppm) on leaf litter breakdown of Inga vera (in bags of 10 and 0.05 mm mesh) and the naturally associated invertebrate community occurring in forested phytotelmata. The study employs an experimental design with microplastic concentration treatments in artificial microcosms (buckets with 800 mL of rainwater) arranged in an area of Atlantic Rain Forest native vegetation of Subtropical systems. The results indicate that elevated concentrations of microplastics may enhance leaf litter breakdown (6–8%), irrespective of the bag mesh, attributed to heightened decomposer activity and biofilm formation. Consequently, this contributes to increased invertebrate richness (33–37%) and greater shredder abundance (21–37%). Indicator analysis revealed that Culicidae, Stratiomyidae, Chironomidae, Empididae, Planorbidae, and Ceratopogonidae were indicative of some microplastic concentrations. These findings underscore the significance of accounting for microplastics when evaluating the taxonomic and trophic characteristics of invertebrate communities, as well as the leaf breakdown process in Subtropical systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The proliferation of plastic pollution, particularly from nurdles (small plastic pellets used in manufacturing), poses significant environmental and ecological risks. Originating with the invention of Bakelite in 1907 and escalating post-World War II with advanced petrochemical technologies, nurdles are the second largest source of primary microplastic pollution globally. Each year an estimated 445,970 tonnes of nurdles enter the environment worldwide. Nurdle spills, such as those along Spain's Galician coast and other global incidents, underline the need for improved spill response, preventive measures, and international regulatory coordination. The environmental impact of nurdles, compared to more visible oil spills, is insidious and long-lasting due to their persistence and widespread dispersion. Current regulations, like the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) guidelines, reveal gaps in enforcement and fail to fully address the long-term consequences of spills. Recent technological innovations and policy interventions aim to mitigate risks, but there's an urgent need for coordinated global action, stricter controls, and investment in biodegradable alternatives to safeguard marine environments and ensure ecological sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " A comprehensive study was undertaken to examine the contamination of spotted scat fish (Scatophagus argus) with microplastics (MP) in various locations along the East Java coast of Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to collect detailed information regarding the abundance, color, shape, size, type of polymer, and chemical components of the MP. The findings of this study indicated that MP exhibiting distinct attributes—including a specific fiber type, black coloration, and a size range of 1000– <5000 μm—was most abundant in the gill, stomach, and intestines of spotted scat fish of varying lengths. And MP with a size range of 100–<500 μm was prevalent in the sediment. MP with black fragments measuring less than 100 μm in diameter were found primarily in seawater. A positive correlation was identified between fish length and MP abundance in the intestines, as indicated by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Conversely, a negative correlation was detected between fish length and MP abundance in the gills. The findings of the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, which indicate the presence of various polymers and chemical substances including plasticizers (e.g., diethyl phthalate, decane, and eicosane), stabilizers (2-piperidinone, hexadecanoic acid, mesitylene, and 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol), and flame retardant (cyclododecene), in fish, are of the utmost importance. These substances have the potential to endanger the health of both animals and humans if they are ingested through the food chain. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The exploitation of exciting features of plastics for diverse applications has resulted in significant plastic waste generation, which negatively impacts environmental compartments, metabolic processes, and the well-being of aquatic ecosystems biota. A shotgun metagenomic approach was deployed to investigate the microbial consortia, degradation pathways, and enzyme systems involved in the degradation of plastics in a tropical lentic pond sediment (APS). Functional annotation of the APS proteome (ORFs) using the PlasticDB database revealed annotation of 1015 proteins of enzymes such as depolymerase, esterase, lipase, hydrolase, nitrobenzylesterase, chitinase, carboxylesterase, polyesterase, oxidoreductase, polyamidase, PETase, MHETase, laccase, alkane monooxygenase, among others involved in the depolymerization of the plastic polymers. It also revealed that polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and nylon have the highest number of annotated enzymes. Further annotation using the KEGG GhostKOALA revealed that except for terephthalate, all the other degradation products of the plastic polymers depolymerization such as glyoxylate, adipate, succinate, 1,4-butanediol, ethylene glycol, lactate, and acetaldehyde were further metabolized to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Taxonomic characterization of the annotated proteins using the AAI Profiler and BLASTP revealed that Pseudomonadota members dominate most plastic types, followed by Actinomycetota and Acidobacteriota. The study reveals novel plastic degraders from diverse phyla hitherto not reported to be involved in plastic degradation. This suggests that plastic pollution in aquatic environments is prevalent with well-adapted degrading communities and could be the silver lining in mitigating the impacts of plastic pollution in aquatic environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics are emerging as prominent pollutants across the globe. Oceans are becoming major sinks for these pollutants, and their presence is widespread in coastal regions, oceanic surface waters, water column, and sediments. Studies have revealed that microplastics cause serious threats to the marine ecosystem as well as human beings. In the past few years, many research efforts have focused on studying different aspects relating to microplastic pollution of the oceans. This review summarizes sources, migration routes, and ill effects of marine microplastic pollution along with various conventional as well as advanced methods for microplastics analysis and control. However, various knowledge gaps in detection and analysis require attention in order to understand the sources and transport of microplastics, which is critical to deploying mitigation strategies at appropriate locations. Advanced removal methods and an integrated approach are necessary, including government policies and stringent regulations to control the release of plastics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.,\n",
       " Retention of microplastics (MPs) at the third largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Sweden was investigated. The plant is one of the most modern and advanced of its kind, with rapid sand filter for tertiary treatment in combination with mechanical, biological, and chemical treatment. It achieved a significantly high treatment efficiency, which brought the MP concentration in its discharge on par with concentrations measured in marine waters of the same region. This novel data shows that properly designed modern WWTPs can reduce the MP content of sewage down to background levels measured in the receiving aquatic environment. Opposite to current understanding of the retention of MP by WWTPs, a modern and well-designed WWTP does not have to be a significant point source for MP. MPs were quantified at all major treatment steps, including digester inlet and outlet sludge. MPs sized 10–500 µm were analyzed by a focal plane array based micro-Fourier transform infrared (FPA-µFTIR) microscopy, a hyperspectral imaging technique, while MPs above 500 µm were analyzed by Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Mass was estimated from the hyperspectral images for MPs <500 µm and from microscope images >500 µm. The overall treatment efficiency was in terms of MP counts 99.98 %, with a daily input of 6.42 × 1010 and output of 1.04 × 107 particles. The mass removal efficiency was 99.99 %. The mechanical part of the treatment, the pre-treatment, and primary stages, reduced both the MP counts and mass by approximately 71 %. The combined biological treatment, secondary settling, and final polishing with rapid sand filtration removed nearly all the remaining 29 %. MPs became successively smaller as they passed the different treatment steps. The digester inlet received 1.04 × 1011 MPs daily, while it discharged 9.96 × 1010 MPs, causing a small but not significant decrease in MP counts, with a corresponding MP mass reduction of 9.56 %. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The widespread use of plastic has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste across a range of sizes, notably including microplastics (MPs). The introduction of MPs into aquatic ecosystems can lead to the contamination of organisms, mainly fish. This study reports for the first time a quantitative and qualitative analysis conducted on the abundance of MPs encountered in water and sediment of milkfish aquaculture ponds in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Water and sediment samples were collected at three stations between February to April 2021. The abundance of MPs was analyzed through the application of one-way ANOVA tests and Pearson's correlation analysis. The results identified four types of MPs: fragments, fibers, films, and pellets. The highest abundance of MPs in both water (10.40 particle/L) and sediment samples (1.15 particle/g) was observed in March. The predominant MPs size in the water samples is 100–500 μm, while it is below 100 μm in the sediment. The color of the MPs varied across eight colors: black, purple, red, blue, yellow, pink, green, and transparent. The identification of MPs polymers was found to be polypropylene (PP), Polyurethane (PU), Polycarbonate (PC), Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The presence of MPs in the water column and sediments was correlated with human activities around the ponds. Hence, the abundance of MPs is a source of pollution that has the potential to damage the nutritional quality of farmed milkfish. This study provides important information for the local governments to develop waste management policies for a cleaner environment and improved human health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",

       " Microplastics (MPs) in the aquatic environment pose a serious threat to biota, by being confounded with food. These effects occur in mussels which are filter-feeding organisms. Mussels from the genus Mytilus sp. were used to evaluate the ecotoxicological effects of two MPs, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), after 4 and 28-days. Measured individual endpoints were condition index and feeding rate; and sub-individual parameters, metabolism of phase I (CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) and II (glutathione S-transferases - GSTs), and antioxidant defense (catalase - CAT). MPs decreased both condition index (CI) and feeding rate (FR). No alterations occurred in metabolic enzymes, suggesting that these MPs are not metabolized by these pathways. Furthermore, lack of alterations in GSTs and CAT activities suggests the absence of conjugation and oxidative stress. Overall, biochemical markers were not responsive, but non-enzymatic responses showed deleterious effects caused by these MPs, which may be of high ecological importance. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (plastic particles <5 mm) permeate aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and constitute a hazard to animal life. Although much research has been conducted on the effects of microplastics on marine and benthic organisms, less consideration has been given to insects, especially those adapted to urban environments. Here, we provide a perspective on the potential consequences of exposure to microplastics within typical larval habitat on mosquito biology. Mosquitoes represent an ideal organism in which to explore the biological effects of microplastics on terrestrial insects, not least because of their importance as an infectious disease vector. Drawing on evidence from other organisms and knowledge of the mosquito life cycle, we summarise some of the more plausible impacts of microplastics including physiological, ecotoxicological and immunological responses. We conclude that although there remains little experimental evidence demonstrating any adverse effect on mosquito biology or pathogen transmission, significant knowledge gaps remain, and there is now a need to quantify the effects that microplastic pollution could have on such an important disease vector. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Waste disposal in landfills remains a global concern. Despite technological developments, landfill leachate poses a hazard to ecosystems and human health since it acts as a secondary reservoir for legacy and emerging pollutants. This study provides a systematic and scientometric review of the nature and toxicity of pollutants generated by landfills and means of assessing their potential risks. Regarding human health, unregulated waste disposal and pathogens in leachate are the leading causes of diseases reported in local populations. Both in vitro and in vivo approaches have been employed in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of landfill leachate, with model organisms ranging from bacteria to birds. These studies demonstrate a wide range of toxic effects that reflect the complex composition of leachate and geographical variations in climate, resource availability and management practices. Based on bioassay (and other) evidence, categories of persistent chemicals of most concern include brominated flame retardants, per- and polyfluorinated chemicals, pharmaceuticals and alkyl phenol ethoxylates. However, the emerging and more general literature on microplastic toxicity suggests that these particles might also be problematic in leachate. Various mitigation strategies have been identified, with most focussing on improving landfill design or leachate treatment, developing alternative disposal methods and reducing waste volume through recycling or using more sustainable materials. The success of these efforts will rely on policies and practices and their enforcement, which is seen as a particular challenge in developing nations and at the international (and transboundary) level. Artificial intelligence and machine learning afford a wide range of options for evaluating and reducing the risks associated with leachates and gaseous emissions from landfills, and various approaches tested or having potential are discussed. However, addressing the limitations in data collection, model accuracy, real-time monitoring and our understanding of environmental impacts will be critical for realising this potential. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Recent studies on the distribution of microplastics in aquatic sediments have deployed different methods and devices for density separation of microplastics from sediments. However, instrument specific limitations have been noted, including their high cost, difficulty in handling, or/and the potential for elevated contamination risk due to their plastic composition. This study improves existing sediment microplastic separation techniques by modifying the commonly used conical shape glass separating funnels. The modification consists in connecting a silicone tube at the base of the funnel, whose opening and closure was manually controlled by a Mohr clamp. This adjustment made to the funnels have effectively mitigated critical clogging problems frequently encountered in density separation units. An experiment was conducted using sand-based sediment spiked with polyamide fragments to validate this method modification. Following a complete extraction protocol with the modification of separating funnels, the microplastic extraction efficiency from sediments was high with a 90% recovery rate. Based on these promising results, future studies should consider naturally diverse substrates, as recovery efficiency may be sediment-dependent. Two key adjustments to the glass separation funnels: • Removal of stopcocks • Use of silicone tubes and Mohr clamps to control sediment release © 2023,\n",
       " The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic ecosystems and their ability to absorb hydrophobic pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), is currently a significant concern. MPs, which are the main breakdown product of plastics, have been frequently detected in the environment, posing serious threats to organisms’ health. One particular pollutant, 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), is a dominant congener of PBDEs and is highly toxic to organisms. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the exposure of marine fishes to PBDEs through MPs and their combined toxic effects. In this study, the embryo toxicity of Hexagrammos otakii was conducted to investigate the combined effects of MPs and BDE-47. The results showed that MPs and BDE-47 co-exposure had detrimental effects on embryonic development, such as reduced hatchability, increased mortality, decreased heart rate, and body malformation. Moreover, the combined toxicity of these substances appeared more pronounced harmful effects compared to exposure to BDE-47 alone. Histopathological examination revealed that co-exposure can cause greater damage to hatching glands and yolk. The enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways included phagosome, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, TCA cycle, and Wnt signaling pathway, which are closely related to embryonic growth. BDE-47 and MPs may activate the Wnt signaling pathway to affect the normal development of embryos. Our results suggest that MPs and BDE-47 exposure may cause growth disorders in the early life stages of H.otakii, leading to abnormal embryonic development. All these results will contribute to the further study of the ecological risk assessment and toxicity of MPs and organic pollutant mixtures in marine fish. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are major concern due to their potential harm to ecosystems and most research has focused on their presence and fate, with limited attention to their biodegradation in aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, MPs act as hotspots for the colonization by a diverse range of microorganisms that can adhere to plastic surfaces, resulting in the subsequent formation of biofilms—a potential threat especially in terms of pathogenicity. This study employed 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA sequencing metagenomic analyses to investigate microbial communities within biofilms on plastic materials exposed to long-term marine and freshwater environments. Three Arcobacter species (Arcobacter nitrofigilis, Arcobacter acticola, and Arcobacter suis) emerged as dominant species in M_MP sample, while Flavobacterium tructae was the predominant species within the F_MP sample. The 18S rRNA sequencing revealed the presence of the fungal phylum Ascomycota and the microalgal species Pseudocharaciopsis ovalis in F_MP. Although, the primary species detected on M_MP and F_MP samples include bacteria previously implicated as pathogen, the predominant species identified in this study were unconnected to MP-associated biofilms or MP degradation. Their presence constitutes a novel discovery, opening promising avenues for the exploration of their potential involvement in the biodegradation of MPs within aquatic environments. © 2024 The Authors.

       " After being for a long time disregarded, marine plastic pollution is now a growing topic among scholars, industry and government. It represents an enormous pressing threat to the integrity of the marine ecosystem, influencing its ability to provide socio-economic benefits on which human well-being is based [1]. The need to react is clear: the annual discharge of plastic into the ocean is estimated to be 11 million tons [2]. Projections indicate that by 2040, plastic leakage into the ocean will nearly triple [2]. This article aims to perform a systematic literature review on marine plastic pollution, approaching it from a problem-solving perspective. The study provides readers with an overview of how the issue is generally perceived and the potential solutions implemented and proposed thus far. Indeed, as a multi-sectoral problem, marine plastic pollution does not have a single solution. An appropriate approach to the problem should involve several levels of action: governmental (at local and global levels) and community-based (consumer and industry commitment and local initiatives). To conduct our systematic review, we decided to narrow our research to three aspects essential for effectively addressing the issue: consumer perception of marine plastic pollution, best local practices of plastic pollution management and global governance of marine plastic. Consumer perception of the issue is crucial in the fight against marine plastic pollution. In this regard, many authors highlight the important role that the general public can play in influencing patterns of industrial and government choice of actions. Sharing knowledge and raising the level of awareness about the issue appears essential. Many authors also stress the importance of bottom-up approaches to implement sustainable waste management. In this sense, local management of marine plastic debris can be seen as an opportunity for communities to drive economic development based on innovative use and disposal of plastic waste. As for the governance level, this study tries to collect research on marine plastics devoted to the study of the ongoing and future possible actions that global decision-makers can take to address the issue. Notwithstanding the high relevance of local governance of marine plastic pollution, we have decided to focus our attention on the global governance level. Indeed, marine plastic pollution, as a global problem, necessarily needs a coordinated international response. Despite the optimistic expectations stemming from the ongoing negotiations for a global plastics-binding treaty since March 2022, the reviewed authors denounce the current international marine plastic legal framework as incomplete and fragmented, characterised by a shortage of effective and binding instruments to reduce marine plastic pollution. Overall, from the analysis of our selected articles, it is possible to observe a rising widespread consensus on the urgency for transitioning from the current linear take–make–dispose approach to a more circular model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Potentially hazardous particles from paints and functional coatings are an overlooked fraction of microplastic (MP) pollution since their accurate identification and quantification in environmental samples remains difficult. We have applied the most relevant techniques from the field of microplastic analysis for their suitability to chemically characterize anti-corrosion coatings containing a variety of polymer binders (LDIR, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, Py-GC/MS) and inorganic additives (ICP-MS/MS). We present the basis of a possible toolbox to study the release and fate of coating particles in the (marine) environment. Our results indicate that, due to material properties, spectroscopic methods alone appear to be unsuitable for quantification of coating/paint particles and underestimate their environmental abundance. ICP-MS/MS and an optimized Py-GC/MS approach in combination with multivariate statistics enables a straightforward comparison of the multi-elemental and organic additive fingerprints of paint particles. The approach can improve the identification of unknown particles in environmental samples by an assignment to different typically used coating types. In future, this approach may facilitate allocation of emission sources of different environmental paint/coating particles. Indeed, future work will be required to tackle various remaining analytical challenges, such as optimized particle extraction/separation of environmental coating particles. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " International trade in fishery and aquaculture products is an important means of providing feed and food for different countries around the world. However, it is also responsible for multiple environmental impacts, namely climate change, as well as novel environmental aspects, such as plastic emissions, through its entire life cycle. In fact, plastic emissions are gaining increasing attention due to their presence in a variety of environmental compartments, especially in marine ecosystems. Hence, this study estimated the carbon footprint and the plastic emissions into the oceans from fishing and aquaculture trade between the European Union (EU) and South America (SA), based on a life cycle perspective. The results reveal that there is an imbalance both in terms of mass and carbon emissions between the import and export flows. SA exports eight-fold more aquaculture and fishing products (877,000 t) than those it imports (112,000 t), emitting twelve-fold more greenhouse gasses (2.9 million metric tons CO2eq.) than the EU (242,000 t CO2eq.), demonstrating the existence of seafood trade imbalances between the two regions. The entire trading releases into the ocean at least 263 t of macroplastic, and 45 t of microplastics from the fishing phase. This suggests the importance of the environmental impacts of the trade flows of aquaculture and fishing products, and the urgent need to decrease carbon emissions and provide more sustainable alternatives to plastic materials in fishing gear. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " This paper provides a comprehensive review on microplastic from source to sink and reviews the current state of knowledge of the topic by focusing on the articles published within the last five years on identification, quantification, analyses, and effects of microplastics on soil and aqueous environments. Microplastics are materials formed either by the degradation of the plastic into smaller micro sized particles or obtained directly in daily products such as cosmetics, toothpastes, domestic cleaning products, etc. Hence, the origin of microplastics is either a primary or secondary microplastic source. The lack of information and research conducted on microplastics in soil compared to water influenced many disparities. These include variations in defining microplastics to lack of conclusive methodologies in analysis of microplastics in soil which therefore lead to gaps in identification of plastic source and comprehension of plastic pollution in soil. The effect of microplastics on different aquatic vertebrates, mammals, and humans is studied and, in most cases, various negative effects were observed in the organism’s physiology. In addition to innovative control methods, there is a growing focus on exploring bioplastics as a potential substitute for traditional plastics. Numerous studies suggest that the environmental impact is more manageable with the production and use of bioplastics. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to confirm the viability of bioplastics as a potential solution.

       " Rivers are important transport pathways for microplastics into the ocean, but they can also be potential sinks due to microplastic deposition in the sediments of the river bed and adjacent floodplains. In particular, floods can (re)mobilise microplastics from sediments and floodplains, (re)deposit and relocate them depending on the floodplain topography. The knowledge about fluvial microplastic input to floodplains, their spatial distribution and their fate in floodplain soils is limited. To investigate this topic, we sampled soil at a depth of 5–20 cm along three transects in three different Rhine floodplains. We analysed the soil samples in tandem with pyrolysis GC/MS and ATR- & μ-FPA-FTIR for their microplastic abundance and mass concentrations. To study the influence of flood frequency on the microplastic abundance in the three floodplains, we fitted a hydrodynamic flood model (MIKE 21, DHI, Hørsholm, Denmark) and related the results to the respective spatial microplastic distribution. We found similar microplastic distribution patterns in each floodplain. The highest microplastic abundance (8516–70,124 microplastics kg−1) and mass concentration (46.2–141.6 mg kg−1) were consistently found in the farthest transects from the Rhine in a topographical depression. This microplastic distribution pattern is detectable with both, pyrolysis GC/MS and FTIR. The strongest correlation between the results of both methods was found for small, abundant microplastic particles. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of microplastics in floodplains is related to the combination of flood frequency and local topography, that ought to be explicitly considered in future studies conducted in floodplains. Finally, our results indicate that pyrolysis GC/MS and FTIR data are comparable under certain conditions, which may help in the decision for the analytical method and sampling design in future studies. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study describes the feeding ecology, spatial distribution of each ontogenetic phase and the corresponding plastic debris contamination, in the Caribbean sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon porosus as a function of spatial-temporal parameters in the Western South American coastal region. The density and biomass of all individuals, captured in a surface drift gillnet fishery, were 1.3 ± 0.3 ind.day −1 and 877 ± 232 g.day −1, respectively. Neonates, and juveniles were captured during all seasons. Adults were largely caught during the late rainy and early dry seasons, probably moving offshore to adjacent open waters during the late dry season. The diet of R. porosus consisted mainly of fish (FO = 71.8%). All ontogenetic phases were contaminated by plastic debris (FO = 100%). Among the plastic debris detected in R. porosus, 91.6% were microplastics (MP) (<5 mm), of which blue fibers contributed 53.7%. The MP samples were identified as polyethylene by Optical microscopy (OM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and by Energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). R. porosus has a high gut concentration of MP compared to fishes of lower trophic levels. In addition, many fishes within the stomach contents of R. porosus were themselves contaminated with MP (e.g., Eugerres brasilianus, Harengula clupeola, Rhinosardinia bahiensis, Anchovia clupeoides, Monacanthus ciliatus, Polydactylus virginicus, Trachinocephalus myops, Eucinostomus melanopterus, and Lutjanus analis). The piscivorous diet of R. porosus likely leads to accumulation of MP contamination in this top predator through trophic transfer. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The orthokinetic coagulation of irregularly shaped polystyrene micro-particles (PS-MP) was investigated in solutions of inorganic cations with different valence (NaCl, CaCl2, LaCl3) using a coagulation jar test set-up combined with light extinction particle counting. The stabilizing effect of model natural organic matter (NOM from reverse-osmosis (RO-NOM), humic (HA) & fulvic acid (FA)) and of surface water components (SW-NOM) was studied. Collision efficiencies were calculated from the decrease in particle concentration applying first order reaction kinetics. The coagulation of PS-MP followed Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory with regard to ionic charge in solution. Highest collision efficiencies were obtained close to the suspected critical coagulation concentrations for CaCl2 (12 mM) and LaCl3 (5.5 mM) whereas for NaCl no CCC was found within the applied concentration range (10–1000 mM). The addition of NOM effectively stabilized PS-MP at low ionic strength (10 mM NaCl) in the order HA > RO-NOM > FA > SW-NOM at concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as low as 0.2–0.5 mg/L DOC through electrostatic repulsion. PS-MP were effectively stabilized in 6.1 mg DOC/L of SW-NOM even at high ionic strength (100 mM MgCl2). Coagulation at intermediate ionic strength (10 mM MgCl2) was only observed for SW-NOM concentrations below 0.6 mg/L DOC. The results showed that even low NOM concentrations prevent PS-MP from orthokinetic coagulation in the presence of high ion concentrations. The study provides further insight in the orthokinetic coagulation behavior of PS-MP in the presence of NOM and highlights the importance of NOM for the stabilization of microplastics in aquatic suspensions. Further research is needed to elucidate the behavior of MP in turbulent systems to predict the mobility MP in aquatic systems such as rivers. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Paint used to coat surfaces in aquatic environments often contain biocides to prevent biofouling, and as these coatings degrade, antifouling paint particles (APPs) end up in aquatic, and especially marine, sediments. However, it is currently unclear what further influence APPs in the sediment have on biotic communities or processes. This study investigates how a variety of commercially-available APPs effect the marine microbial community by spiking different laboratory-manufactured APPs to sediment. Following exposure for 30 and 60 days, APPs caused a clear and consistent effect on the bacterial community composition as determined by 16S metabarcoding. This effect was strongest between 0 and 30 days, but continues to a lesser extent between 30 and 60 days. APPs appear to inhibit the highly diverse, but in general rarer, fraction of the community and/or select for specific community members to become more dominant. 71 antifouling-presence and 454 antifouling-absence indicator taxa were identified by indicator analysis. The difference in the level of classification in these two indicator groups was highly significant, with the antifouling-presence indicators having much higher percentage sequence identity to cultured taxa, while the antifouling-absence indicators appear to be made up of undescribed taxa, which may indicate that APPs act as a proxy for general anthropogenic influence or that APP contamination selects for taxa capable of being cultured. Given the clear and consistent effect APPs have on the surrounding sediment microbial community, further research into how APPs affect sediment functional processes and how such effects scale with concentration is recommended to better assess the wider consequences of these pollutants for marine biogeochemical cycles in the future. Synopsis: Microplastic-paint particles are commonly found in marine sediment but little is known about how these, especially antifouling, paint particles affect sediment microbial communities. This study demonstrates that antifouling paint particles fundamentally alter sediment microbial communities. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Using seabirds as bioindicators of marine plastic pollution requires an understanding of how the plastic retained in each species compares with that found in their environment. We show that brown skua Catharacta antarctica regurgitated pellets can be used to characterise plastics in four seabird taxa breeding in the central South Atlantic, even though skua pellets might underrepresent the smallest plastic items in their prey. Fregetta storm petrels ingested more thread-like plastics and white-faced storm petrels Pelagodroma marina more industrial pellets than broad-billed prions Pachyptila vittata and great shearwaters Ardenna gravis. Ingested plastic composition (type, colour and polymer) was similar to floating plastics in the region sampled with a 200 μm net, but storm petrels were better indicators of the size of plastics than prions and shearwaters. Given this information, plastics in skua pellets containing the remains of seabirds can be used to track long-term changes in floating marine plastics. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are gaining global attention in recent years due to its widespread distribution and potential health impacts. The present study focuses on the distribution and characterisation of microplastics in the sediments and its transfer into the organisms living in Kavvayi and Kumbla backwaters of Northern Malabar region, Kerala, India. MP isolation procedures including density separation, organic matter digestion, and membrane filtration followed by visual and spectral analyses using optical microscope and confocal Raman spectroscopy have been utilised for the microplastic evaluation. Microplastics of size range up to 1 μm was analysed, and the presence of MPs was detected in all samples with an average abundance of 99.5 ± 69.43 particles/kg and 96.57 ± 29.96 particles/kg in Kavvayi and Kumbla backwaters respectively. Raman spectral analysis confirmed that almost 50% of MPs to be synthetic elastomers with the remaining half encompassed by polyamide, polyethylene, polyester, polyurethane, and polypropylene. Higher abundance of MPs in the edible aquatic organisms like clams, prawns, and fishes confirmed the transfer of MP from the environment into living organisms envisages the need of further investigation on toxicological impacts and management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a global challenge that affects all marine ecosystems, and reflects all types of uses and activities of human society in these environments. In marine ecosystems, microplastics and mesoplastics interact with invertebrates and become available to higher predators, such as fish, which can ingest these contaminants. This study aimed to analyze how ecological food interactions (diet overlap and trophic niche amplitude) among fish species contribute to the ingestion of plastic particles. The gastrointestinal contents of six fish species (Atherinella brasiliensis, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Eucinostomus argenteus, Genidens genidens, Coptodon rendalli, and Geophagus brasiliensis) were analyzed to identify prey items and plastic ingestion. Based on the ontogenetic classification, A. brasiliensis, E. melanopterus, and G. genidens were divided into juveniles and adults, and the six fish species analyzed were divided into nine predator groups. Most of the plastics ingested by the fish species were blue microplastic (MP) fibers (< 0.05 mm) classified as polyester terephthalate, polyethylene, and polybutadiene. Considering all the analyzed predators, the average number and weight of plastics ingested per individual were 2.01 and 0.0005 g, respectively. We observed that predators with a high trophic overlap could present a relationship with the intake of MP fibers owing to predation on the same resources. In addition, we observed the general pattern that when a species expands its trophic diversity and niche, it can become more susceptible to plastic ingestion. For example, the species with the highest Levin niche amplitude, E. argenteus juveniles, had the highest mean number (2.9) of ingested MP fibers. Understanding the feeding ecology and interactions among species, considering how each predator uses habitats and food resources, can provide a better understanding of how plastic particle contamination occurs and which habitats are contaminated with these polluting substances. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The widespread presence of microplastics (MPs) in the ocean has varying degrees of impact on ecosystems and even human health. Coastal tidal zones are crucial in controlling the movement of MPs, which are influenced by waves and tidal forces. Meanwhile, natural nanobubbles (NBs) in the ocean can affect the hydrodynamic properties of the tidal zone. The mobilization of MPs in coastal tidal zones under the effect of NBs has been less studied. In this study, we explored natural NBs' influence on the mobilization of MPs in shorelines subject to seawater infiltration. Using glass beads as a substrate, a coastal porous environment was constructed through column experiments, and the pump-controlled water flow was used to study the transport of MPs subject to seawater movement within the substrate. The infiltration of MPs under continuous and transient conditions, as well as the upward transport induced by flood tide, were considered. The role of salinity in the interactions between NBs, MPs, and substrates was evaluated. Salinity altered the energy barriers between particles, which in turn affected the movement of MPs within the substrate. In addition, hydrophilic MPs were more likely to infiltrate within the substrate and had different movement patterns under continuous and transient flow conditions. The motion of the MPs within the substrate varied with flow rate, and NBs limited the vertical movement of MPs in the tidal zone. It was also observed that NBs adsorbed readily onto substrates, altering the surface properties of substrates, particularly their ability to attach and detach from other substances. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In recent decades, the ubiquity of micro and nanoplastics (MNPs) pollution has emerged as a global concern due to its potential risks to both ecological and human health. The detrimental effects of MNPs have resulted in significant changes in the physicochemical and biological properties of terrestrial soil and benthic sediment. These alterations have led to a disrupted nutrient cycle, potential future climate hazards, and further impacts on ecosystem services. This review aims to discuss the possible origins, composition, abundance, life cycle, and transport processes of MNPs in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. It seeks to understand the potential ecological and human health risks associated with MNPs pollution and explores their implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Moreover, this review highlights the advanced analytical techniques used to detect and quantify MNPs. It further suggests policy frameworks to combat this pollution in natural environments. The findings of this review are intended to assist environmentalists, microbiologists, hydrologists, and policymakers in identifying scientific gaps and pragmatic solutions to reduce MNPs pollution. Future research should investigate the intake mechanism and impact of MNPs on plants in different ecosystems, as well as their effects on food chains and human health. This will ensure that the ecological and human health risks associated with MNPs pollution can be timely mitigated. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,\n",
       " This is the first attempt that investigate the abundance of plasticizers in leachate sediment in the scientific literature, alongside the debut effort to explore the abundance of microplastics and plasticizers in landfill leachate and sediment in Sri Lanka. Microplastics in sizes ranging from ≥2.0–5.0, ≥1.0–2.0, and ≥ 0.5–1.0 mm were extracted from the leachate draining from ten municipal solid waste open dump sites and sediment samples covering seven districts. Microplastics were extracted by density separation (Saturated ZnCl2) followed by wet peroxide digestion and the chemical identification was conducted by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Plasticizers were extracted to hexane and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The total mean microplastic abundance in leachate was 2.06 ± 0.62 mg/L whereas it was 363 ± 111 mg/kg for leachate sediments. The most frequently found polymer type was polyethylene (>50%), and white color was dominant. The average concentration of bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenone (BP) and diethyl-hydrogen phthalate (DHEP) in leachate was 158 ± 84.4, 0.75 ± 0.16 and 170 ± 85.8 μg/L respectively. Furthermore, BP and DHEP in leachate sediment was 100 ± 68.3 and 1034 ± 455 μg/kg respectively. As landfill leachate is directly discharged into nearby surface and groundwater bodies that serve as sources of drinking water, the study highlights the potential concerns of microplastic and plasticizer exposure to the surrounding Sri Lankan community through consumption of contaminated drinking water. Therefore, there is a timely need of develop the effective waste management and pollution control measures to minimize the possible threats to both the environment and human health. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) existing extensively in various ecosystems can be ingested by marine organisms and enter the food chain, resulting the health risks from the presence of MPs in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In the present study, an ideal model for Lepidoptera, the silkworm, Bombyx mori, was exposed to environmental concentrations (0.125 μg, 0.25 μg or 0.5 μg/diet) of MPs for 5 days, and the global changes in gut microbes and metabolites were subsequently examined via 16S rDNA sequencing and GC‒MS-based metabolomics. The results showed that MPs exposure did not seriously threaten survival but may regulate signaling pathways involved in development and cocoon production. MPs exposure induced gut microbiota perturbation according to the indices of α-diversity and β-diversity, and the functional prediction of the altered microbiome and associated metabolites demonstrated the potential roles of the altered microbiome following MPs exposure in the metabolic and physiological states of silkworm. The metabolites markedly altered following MPs exposure may play vital biological roles in energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, xenobiotic detoxiﬁcation and the immune system by directly or indirectly affecting the physiological state of silkworms. These findings contribute to assessing the health risks of MPs exposure in model insects and provide novel insight into the toxicity mechanism of MPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study investigates the combined impact of microplastics (MP) and Chlorpyriphos (CPF) on sea urchin larvae (Paracentrotus lividus) under the backdrop of ocean warming and acidification. While the individual toxic effects of these pollutants have been previously reported, their combined effects remain poorly understood. Two experiments were conducted using different concentrations of CPF (EC10 and EC50) based on previous studies from our group. MP were adsorbed in CPF to simulate realistic environmental conditions. Additionally, water acidification and warming protocols were implemented to mimic future ocean conditions. Sea urchin embryo toxicity tests were conducted to assess larval development under various treatment combinations of CPF, MP, ocean acidification (OA), and temperature (OW). Morphometric measurements and biochemical analyses were performed to evaluate the effects comprehensively. Results indicate that combined stressors lead to significant morphological alterations, such as increased larval width and reduced stomach volume. Furthermore, biochemical biomarkers like acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GRx) activities were affected, indicating oxidative stress and impaired detoxification capacity. Interestingly, while temperature increase was expected to enhance larval growth, it instead induced thermal stress, resulting in lower growth rates. This underscores the importance of considering multiple stressors in ecological assessments. Biochemical biomarkers provided early indications of stress responses, complementing traditional growth measurements. The study highlights the necessity of holistic approaches when assessing environmental impacts on marine ecosystems. Understanding interactions between pollutants and environmental stressors is crucial for effective conservation strategies. Future research should delve deeper into the impacts at lower biological levels and explore adaptive mechanisms in marine organisms facing multiple stressors. By doing so, we can better anticipate and mitigate the adverse effects of anthropogenic pollutants on marine biodiversity and ecosystem health. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The toxic effects of tire wear particles (TWPs) on organisms have attracted widespread concerns over the past decade. However, the underlying toxicity mechanism of TWPs, especially aged TWPs to marine microalgae remains poorly understood. This study investigated the physiological and metabolic responses of Phaeodactylum tricornutum to different concentrations of TWPs (Experiment 1), virgin and differently aged TWPs (Experiment 2) as well as their leachates and leached particles (Experiment 3). Results demonstrated that TWPs promoted the growth of microalgae at low concentrations (0.6 and 3 mg L−1) and inhibited their growth at high concentrations (15 and 75 mg L−1). Moreover, aged TWPs induced more profound physiological effects on microalgae than virgin TWPs, including inhibiting microalgae growth, decreasing the content of Chla, promoting photosynthetic efficiency, and causing oxidative damage to algal cells. Untargeted metabolomics analysis confirmed that aged TWPs induced more pronounced metabolic changes than virgin TWPs. This study represented the first to demonstrate that both particulate- and leachate-induced toxicity of TWPs was increased after aging processes, which was confirmed by the changes in the surface morphology of TWPs and enhanced release of additives. Through the significant correlations between the additives and the microalgal metabolites, key additives responsible for the shift of microalgal metabolites were identified. These results broaden the understanding of the toxicity mechanism of aged TWPs to microalgae at the physiological and metabolic levels and appeal for considering the effects of long-term aging on TWP toxicity in risk assessment of TWPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Ocean pollution by microplastics represents a threat to phytoplankton health, yet there is few knowledge on physical interactions between microplastics and microalgal cell surfaces. We studied the contact between environmentally aged microplastics and four microalgal species by atomic force microscopy. After seven days, microalgae showed malformations at specific sites, and these malformations varied with species. Depending on whether the cell had a porous or a smooth surface, microplastics adsorbed to the cell surface via embedding or denting, leading to minor defects or noticeable wrinkles in cell walls. Results also showed that microplastics penetrate into microalgae. Such cellular engulfment of microplastics was less present in typical diatoms because diatoms bear a porous frustule capable of trapping tiny particles. Moreover, we observed a novel type of deformation, bowl-shaped depressions, only in non-porous microalgae. The geometric features of malformations are correlated with the shape and size of microplastics. Our findings reveal for the first time the species-specific deformation in microalgae due to microplastic exposure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Tidal dynamics contribute to fluctuations in microplastic abundance (MPs). This is the first study to characterize MPs under the influence of tidal fluctuations in the Musi River Estuary. MPs samples were collected during flood and ebb tides at 10 research stations representing the inner, middle and outer parts of the Musi River Estuary. MPs were extracted to identify the shape, color and size. MP abundances were 467.67 ± 127.84 particles/m3 during flood tide and 723.67 ± 112.05 particles/m3 during ebb tide. The concentration of MPs in the outer zone of the estuary (ocean) was detected to be higher than in the inner zone of the estuary (river). The MPs found were dominated by black color, film shape and size 101–250 μm. A greater abundance of MPs at ebb tide than at flood tide implies that the Musi Estuary's largest source of emissions is discharge from the river. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This overview discusses the ideas behind a collection of articles by invited authors on a diverse range of complex chemical mixtures and analytical methods which represent some of the most relevant and interesting issues on emerging contaminants of environmental health concerns. These chemicals, including those in high volume production, are released on an ongoing basis as a result of various human activities. Moreover, these emerging contaminants are highly toxic to humans and ubiquitous in the environment. The terms “environmental pollution\" and “food web contaminant\" became widely known from the first decades of the XX century and as a historical background, they have an early link to the agricultural use of mercury fungicides and DDT. Surprisingly for chemists and society, the 1960s saw the emergence of the global problem of environmental and food contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The environmental science paradigm has lost none of its importance in the meantime, although it has evolved to encompass a vast number of environmentally hazardous chemicals, many of which are termed as “emerging\". To put it simply, air-water-soil/sediment are the first compartments affected and become reservoirs or sinks for environmental pollutants, the next is the food web, topped by the top animal predators and humans. Understanding the occurrence, environmental fate and biotoxicity of emerging contaminants is of interest to many areas of science. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The pervasive presence of microplastics in our environment necessitates urgent measures to prevent further release and address existing contamination hotspots. This work focuses on the removal of microplastics from sludges and sediments through the application of dissolved air flotation (DAF). In addition to experimental investigations, the study presents the development of a predictive model for the formation of aggregates comprising air bubbles and microplastics in the DAF contact zone. First an empirical model was established to predict the attachment efficiency between air bubbles and particles (αdb). To this end, the experimental attachment efficiency was determined for various plastics, with varying particle sizes and shape factors, and system conditions. The obtained data set was utilized to establish an empirical model by PLS regression describing αdb based on particle size, bubble size, density, Hamaker constant, contact angle, solid load, aspect ratio, circularity, and sphericity, resulting in an MSPE of 0.011 and adjusted-R² of 0.64. Secondly, a semi-deterministic model based on the XDLVO theory was developed using MLR, where αdb was described by the natural logarithm of the Van der Waals, electrostatic and hydrophobic forces acting between the particle and air bubble, and the solid load, with an RSE of 0.067 and adjusted-R² of 0.63. Finally, the applicability of these models was demonstrated in a case study on industrial sludge consisting of sediment and PVC microplastics. Validation of the attachment efficiency and the dimensioning of a DAF unit for processing this sludge at a capacity of 20 m³.h−1 emphasize the practical implications of the developed models. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics are pieces of plastic less than 5 mm in size. They have emerged as a global environmental issue due to their prevalence in natural environments. They emanate from multiple sources and persist in aquatic environments, resulting in their bioaccumulation, which has diverse ecological health consequences. This article delves into the main trends for plastic/microplastic research and management, such as collection and disposal, generation, microbial degradation coupled with physical and chemical degradation methods, and microbial enzymatic mechanisms (lipases, esterases, peroxidases, and proteases), policy directions, and waste management strategies. The various issues that have emerged due to the generation of plastic/microplastic are discussed, including their environmental fate and effect on the living system. Further, looking for a solution through microbiological biodegradation approaches is necessary. The comprehensive strategy that integrates research, technologies to control plastic wastes, preventive measures, and implementation of policies and international collaboration can be used to create advanced microplastic management policies. The standards for short-term and long-term policies have been discussed, making suggestions to avoid using plastic and plastic products in their daily lives. Hence, the comprehensive understanding of microplastic microbial degradation (through genetic engineering and synthetic biology applications where the novel degrading genes can be transferred to the degrading strains) acts as a future solution to combat the microplastics issues, and robust measures for their management are needed in terms of; (reduce, re-use and recycle concept of microplastics), and can be the way forwards to prevent their environmental impact and ecological repercussions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Globally, over 287 million tons of plastic are disposed in landfills, rivers, and oceans or are burned every year. The results are devastating to our ecosystems, wildlife and human health. One promising remedy is the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor larvae), which has proved capable of degrading microplastics (MPs). This paper presents a new investigation into the biodegradation of aged polyethylene (PE) film and polystyrene (PS) foam by the Tenebrio molitor larvae. After a 35 − day feeding period, both pristine and aged MPs can be consumed by larvae. Even with some inhibitions in larvae growth due to the limited nutrient supply of aged MPs, when compared with pristine MPs, the aged MPs were depolymerized more efficiently in gut microbiota based on gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. With the change in surface chemical properties, the metabolic intermediates of aged MPs contained more oxygen−containing functional groups and shortened long−chain alkane, which was confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC−MS). High−throughput sequencing revealed that the richness and diversity of gut microbes were restricted in the MPs-fed group. Although MPs had a negative effect on the relative abundance of the two dominant bacteria Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae, the aged MPs may promote the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae. Redundancy analysis (RDA) further verified that the aged MPs are effectively biodegraded by yellow mealworm. This work provides new insights into insect−mediated mechanisms of aged MP degradation and promising strategies for MP sustainable and efficient solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution threatens some of the world's most iconic locations for marine biodiversity, including the remote Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. Using the Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) as a sentinel species, the present study assessed microplastics and suspected anthropogenic cellulose concentrations in surface seawater and zooplankton near Santa Cruz and Galápagos penguin colonies (Floreana, Isabela, Santiago), as well as in penguin potential prey (anchovies, mullets, milkfish) and penguin scat. On average, 0.40 ± 0.32 microplastics L−1 were found in surface seawater (<10 μm; n = 63 L), while 0.003, 0.27, and 5.12 microplastics individual−1 were found in zooplankton (n = 3372), anchovies (n = 11), and mullets (n = 6), respectively. The highest concentration (27 microplastics individual−1) was observed in a single milkfish. Calculations based on microplastics per gram of prey, in a potential diet composition scenario, suggest that the Galápagos penguin may consume 2881 to 9602 microplastics daily from prey. Despite this, no microplastics or cellulose were identified in 3.40 g of guano collected from two penguins. Our study confirms microplastic exposure in the pelagic food web and endangered penguin species within the UNESCO World Heritage site Galápagos Islands, which can be used to inform regional and international policies to mitigate plastic pollution and conserve biodiversity in the global ocean.

       " Microplastic pollution in estuarine, coastal and riverine areas is considered a serious environmental and human health concern in Vietnam. The present study investigated potential sources, location, transport, and environmental impacts of microplastics in Vietnamese aquatic environments through a literature review and scientometrics analysis. Findings indicated that the distribution and severity of microplastic pollution in the country is influenced by a complex interplay of environmental, geomorphological, and climatic factors, as well as those related to urban and industrial development, population behavior, law enforcement capabilities, and environmental education. Additionally, this research explored potential solutions, drawing from artificial intelligence applications identified through a scientometrics analysis, to propose effective measures for curbing microplastic pollution in Vietnam. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Recent studies have identified the presence of microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles in Arctic marine environments, but very little is known about anthropogenic microparticles in Arctic and sub-Arctic freshwater systems. Given the importance of freshwater systems to the health of northern communities, and their large input of water to the Arctic Ocean, circumpolar rivers and lakes should be considered within the context of anthropogenic microparticles in the region. Sample collections for this study were conducted in July and August of 2021 via a collaborative community-based approach. Thirty surface water samples were collected using a 300 µm Manta trawl from three sampling areas, the Yellowknife River (n = 10), Yellowknife Back Bay (n = 10), and Yellowknife Outer Bay (n = 10), to assess concentrations and transport of microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles to Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories. Each trawl was towed for 20-minutes, resulting in 16 to 233 m3 of water filtered per sample. Suspected anthropogenic microparticles were found in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.03–2.04 particles m−3, however, there were no significant differences in microparticle concentrations between sampling areas. A wide range of microparticle morphologies and colours were observed in the samples. A total of 1012 suspected anthropogenic microparticles were extracted from the surface water samples, of which fibres accounted for 87 % (n = 883), followed by fragments (11 %, n = 112), films (1 %, n = 7), and foams (1 %, n = 10). Our results indicate a widespread occurrence of microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles in the surface waters surrounding Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study examines the contribution of plastics to total waste generation in Jashore district, Bangladesh. With a staggering daily production of 3000 tons of plastic waste in Bangladesh, the district of Jashore emerges as a significant contributor. A descriptive survey was conducted among 450 respondents of Jashore Sadar Upazila. Factor analysis was used based on the Likert scale to determine the people's awareness issues. The study reveals that the predominant types of plastic wastes are Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 40.75%, followed by Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 28.15%, and High-density polyethylene (HDPE) at 28.10%, with the remaining 3.0% comprising other types. The most common waste management practices in both urban and rural areas of Jashore Sadar Upazila include burying (3.9%), open dumping (41.4%), open burning (32.4%), recycling (approximately 7.65%), and waste disposal in designated bins (approximately 14.7%). The open dumping of plastic remains in the environment and deteriorates the environmental quality. Descriptive analysis was done using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. Attitudes of the respondents were determined considering the plastic use and disposal pattern. Fourteen factors were used in this case and Eigenvalues (EVs) were considered. About 58% of the EVs were <0.5, indicating that recycling was highly encouraged. On the contrary, about 42% of the EVs were >0.5, indicating that reusing plastic waste was not beneficial for the environment. The study proposes that reusing plastic waste could play a pivotal role in reducing environmental pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs, plastic items from 1 µm to 5 mm in size) are present in all environmental compartments. The evaluation of their concentration, fate, and spatial distribution is still a challenge for the scientific community. This concern is just debuting in developing countries, (i.e., Asia, South America, and Africa). This study deals with the MP contamination in the abiotic marine compartments of Northern Vietnam: seawater and intertidal sediments. Four sites located in the intertidal zone or near the coastline in Tonkin Bay, Vietnam were studied. A total of 16 samples (eight for each compartment) were collected in July 2020 (rainy season) and January 2021 (dry season). Anthropogenic particles (total observed fibers and fragments) were found at levels ranging from 3 to 303 particles/m3 in seawater and from 63 to 955 particles/kg dry weight in sediments. Most of these were fibers less than 300-µm long. Higher levels of seawater at the Nam Dinh site were found in the rainy season compared to the dry one. As the river flow was estimated six times higher during the rainy season than during the dry season, these results suggest the river discharge is a potential source of contamination for the coastal zone. The temporal variability was lower for the sediments than for the seawater, suggesting the long-term integration of the anthropogenic particles in this compartment. A small portion of sorted particles were analyzed by µFTIR (8.35%), and this sub-sample was only composed of fragments. Still, fragments were mostly composed of polypropylene (PP, 82%), polyethylene (PE, 9%), and polystyrene (PS, 9%). The fragment size was similar in the two studied compartments, but it was dependent on polymer types since PS fragments (140 ± 17 µm) were smaller than those made of PE (622 ± 123 µm) and PP (869 ± 905 µm). Future works should investigate the smallest fraction of MP (even nanoplastics) as well as find solutions in order to mitigate MP contamination in the marine environment.

       " Plastic nurdles pose a significant environmental threat due to recurrent accidental spills into marine ecosystems. This report examines the nurdle pollution over the 1498 km of the Galician coastline (Spain) following the spill of 25 t of nurdles into the Northwest Atlantic after the loss of six containers from the Toconao vessel in December 2023. This accident highlights the urgent need for proactive, effective measures in maritime transport to prevent and mitigate such environmental catastrophes. The complexity of nurdle dispersion challenges the evaluation of their fate at sea, and the potential long-term consequences on the marine ecosystem and food web remain uncertain and yet to be investigated. This report also presents the VIEIRA collaborative and underscores the critical role of citizen-led initiatives in responding to such environmental disasters, and advocates for efficient policy reforms, involving cross-border collaboration. Furthermore, we call for greater international cooperation to underpin effective regulatory frameworks to address the growing hazard of plastic nurdle pollution worldwide. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution has wreaked havoc on biodiversity and food safety globally. The false ingestion of MPs causes harmful effects on organisms, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. The present review comprehended the current knowledge of MP contamination in Crustacea and Mollusca from 75 peer-reviewed articles published in Asia between 2015 and 2023. A total of 79 species (27 Crustacea and 52 Mollusca) have been recorded to be contaminated with MPs. Out of the total 27 species of Crustacea, Metopograpsus quadridentatus (327.56 MPs/individual) and Balanus albicostatus (0.42 MPs/individual) showed the highest and lowest contamination, respectively. Out of the total 52 species of Mollusca, Dolabella auricularia (2325 MPs/individual) and Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis (0.2 MPs/individual) showed the highest and lowest contamination, respectively. In terms of country-wise MP contamination, China has the highest number of contaminated species in both phylums among Asia. Findings of pollution indices revealed a very high risk of MP contamination in all the countries. Fiber was reported predominantly in both groups. Blue and black-colored MPs having <500 μm and <500 μm–1 mm size were found dominantly in Crustacea and Mollusca, respectively. Polypropylene was recorded as the dominant plastic polymer in both Crustacea and Mollusca. In essence, this review has provided a comprehensive insight into MP concentration in Crustacea and Mollusca of Asia, highlighting variations among species and geographic locations. This understanding is crucial for tackling urgent environmental challenges, safeguarding human health, and promoting global sustainability initiatives amid the escalating issue of plastic pollution. Practitioner Points: Microplastic pollution has created havoc on biodiversity and food safety. A total of 27 and 52 species of crustaceans and Mollusca have been recorded to be contaminated with MPs. Metopograpsus quadridentate and Dolabella auricularia have shown higher MPs contamination. Polypropylene was recorded as the dominant plastic polymer in both crustacean and Mollusca.

       " Marine snow floc refers to coagulation of microbes and marine debris in the upper ocean layers, bound together by bio-polymers such as transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) secreted by microbes. The stickiness of TEP plays a crucial role in determining the rate of marine snow floc formation. Additionally, the effect of TEP on the size distribution of marine snow influences the sinking velocity of the flocs. Using a surrogate material system, we study the kinetics of marine snow using a custom-built experimental setup, which allows direct measurement of floc size, floc number density, and floc sinking velocity as a function of TEP concentration. By comparing the experimental floc size with Smoluchowski coagulation theory, we obtain stickiness index, which increases with TEP concentration first, reaches maximum around 0.3 g/L of TEP and decreases upon further increase in TEP concentration. The experimental sinking velocity scales with floc size as ws=adb, with b ranging from 0.57 to 0.68. The exponent is slightly higher than that of 0.5 expected in the Stokes limit. This study establishes a clear link between stickiness index, sinking velocity, and polymer concentration, providing valuable insights for modelling of marine snow dynamics in deep ocean conditions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the kinetics of marine snow formation, essential for predicting carbon sequestration within the biological carbon pump. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) act as carriers for organic pollutants (e.g. antibiotics) and microorganisms (e.g. bacteria) in waters, leading to the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, the antibiotics adsorbed on MPs may exacerbate this process. For further research, it is necessary to understand the types and amounts of antibiotics adsorbed on MPs. However, due to the heavy work of MPs collection and sample pretreatment, there is a lack of analytical methods and relevant data. In this study, an in-tube solid phase microextraction (IT-SPME) on-line coupled to HPLC-MS/MS method based on amorphous precursor polymer of three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks/monolith-based composite adsorbent was developed, which could efficiently capture, enrich and analyze tetracycline (TCs) antibiotics. Under the optimal extraction parameters, the developed method was capable of detecting TCs at levels as low as 0.48–1.76 pg. This method was applied to analyze the TCs adsorbed on MPs of different particle sizes in mariculture water for the first time, requiring a minimum amount of MPs of only 1 mg. Furthermore, it was observed that there could be an antagonistic relationship between algal biofilm and TCs loaded on MPs. This approach could open up new possibilities for analyzing pollutants on MPs and support deeper research on MPs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Rayon microfibers, micro-sized semi-synthetic polymers derived from cellulose, have been frequently detected and reported as “micropollutants” in marine environments. However, there has been limited research on their ecotoxicity and combined effects with persistent organic pollutants (POPs). To address these knowledge gaps, thick-shell mussels (Mytilus coruscus) were exposed to rayon microfibers at 1000 pieces/L, along with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at 100 and 1000 ng/L for 14 days, followed by a 7-day recovery period. We found that rayon microfibers at the environmentally relevant concentration exacerbated the irreversible effects of PCBs on the immune and digestive systems of mussels, indicating chronic and sublethal impacts. Furthermore, the results of 16 s rRNA sequencing demonstrated significant effects on the community structure, species richness, and diversity of the mussels' intestinal microbiota. The branching map analysis identified the responsive bacteria to rayon microfibers and PCBs belonging to the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota phyla. Despite not being considered a conventional plastic, the extensive and increasing use of rayon fibers, their direct toxicological effects, and their interaction with POPs highlight the need for urgent attention, investigation, and regulation to address their contribution to \"micropollution\". © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This research addresses the growing need for fast and cost-efficient methods for microplastic (MP) analysis. We present a thermo-analytical method that enables the identification and quantification of different polymer types in sediment and sand composite samples based on their phase transition behavior. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed, and the results were evaluated by using different regression models. The melting and crystallization enthalpies or the change in heat capacity at the glass transition point were measured as regression analysis data. Ten milligrams of sea sand was spiked with 0.05 to 1.5 mg of microplastic particles (size: 100 to 200 µm) of the semi-crystalline polymers LD-PE, HD-PE, PP, PA6, and PET, and the amorphous polymers PS and PVC. The results showed that a two-factorial regression enabled the unambiguous identification and robust quantification of different polymer types. The limits of quantification were 0.13 to 0.33 mg and 0.40 to 1.84 mg per measurement for semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers, respectively. Moreover, DSC is robust with regard to natural organic matrices and allows the fast and non-destructive analysis of microplastic within the analytical limits. Hence, DSC could expand the range of analytical methods for microplastics and compete with perturbation-prone chemical analyses such as thermal extraction–desorption gas chromatography–mass spectrometry or spectroscopic methods. Further work should focus on potential changes in phase transition behavior in more complex matrices and the application of DSC for MP analysis in environmental samples. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " As the global plastics pollution crisis grows in severity and complexity, diverse solutions are being proposed across the public and private sectors. Notably, multinational corporations (MNCs) from the petrochemical and consumer goods sectors have become increasingly involved. From providing recycling infrastructure to directly participating in drafting action plans and policies, MNCs are engaging as political actors in plastics waste governance, influencing discourses and actions globally, a process referred to as political corporate social responsibility (CSR). In this article, I examine Coca-Cola’s World Without Waste initiative as a case study of this process. I evaluate how Coca-Cola frames the problems of plastics waste, their solutions, and the roles that Coca-Cola asserts within this complex, transboundary environmental governance issue. Borrowing from literature on corporate climate delay tactics, I demonstrate how the initiative implements discourses and practices of delayed action, hindering comprehensive governance strategies. Through this analysis, I argue that political CSR actions can exacerbate the global plastics pollution crisis through ineffective and inequitable waste governance approaches that perpetuate uneven plastics pollution burdens. © 2024 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.,\n",
       " There have been growing apprehensions and concerns regarding the increasing presence of plastic pollutants in the holiest river of India, the Ganga, and its major tributary, Yamuna. In response to this issue, the current study aimed to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the seasonal and spatial distribution of macro to microplastics (MPs) in the surface water, water column, and sediments from the River Ganga and Yamuna. MP samples were collected from various points of these Rivers, including upstream, downstream, and drainage points around the vicinity of Haridwar, Agra, Prayagraj, and Patna cities. With a significant seasonal variation, the estimated MPs and plastic flux were higher during the wet season than during the dry season. MPs sized 300 µm-1 mm and fibre-shaped blue and black colored MPs were pre-dominant in both rivers. Polyacrylamide, polyamide, and polyvinyl chloride were the most ascertained polymers. MPs including hazardous polymers (hazard score >1000) may pose a risk to the population of Indo-Gangetic Plain via direct and indirect exposure to MPs. The information provided in this study could serve as a starting point for the action plan required by municipal corporations to mitigate plastic pollution and target the possible sources at each location. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have attracted increasing attention due to their ubiquitous occurrence in freshwater sediments and the detrimental effects on benthic invertebrates. However, a clear understanding of their downstream impacts on ecosystem services is still lacking. This study examines the effects of bio-based polylactic acid (PLA), fuel-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and biofilm-covered PET (BPET) MPs on the bioturbator chironomid larvae (Tanypus chinensis), and the influence on phosphorus (P) profiles in microcosms. The changes in biochemical responses and metabolic pathways indicated that MPs disrupted energy synthesis by causing intestinal blockage and oxidative stress in T. chinensis, leading to energy depletion and impaired bioturbation activity. The impairment further resulted in enhanced sedimentary P immobilization. For larval treatments, the internal-P loadings were respectively 11.4%, 8.6%, and 9.0% higher in the PLA, PET, and BPET groups compared to the non-MP control. Furthermore, the influence of bioturbation on P profiles was MP-type dependent. Both BPET and PLA treatments displayed more obvious impacts on P profiles compared to PET due to the changes in MP bioavailability or sediment microenvironment.

The coastal and bottom sediments of this river play an important role as a transfer link of microplastics. With Py-GC/MS and μFT-IR methods, it was found that the sediments contain up to 350 mg/kg or 650 particles/kg of microplastic (dry weight). The unique hydrologic conditions of the river branching area contribute to the formation of a microplastic pollution hotspot. The hotspot accumulates >30 % of microplastic pollution, mainly ABS plastic particles smaller than 0.3 mm with roughness and cracks, which increases the hazard class (from II to IV) of microplastic pollution. Obtained data and high annual variability of pollution indicates that this area acts as a place of accumulation, degradation and gradual release of microplastics into the White and Barents Seas, i.e. into the Arctic region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Coral reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to pollution from marine debris, especially if the regions are noted for tourism and fishing. Palk Bay on the south east coast of India is a famous tourist and fishing region, where the marine debris accumulation poses a great threat to the coastal ecosystem. In this study during 2018–2020, the marine debris distribution and their interactions with coral reefs of Palk Bay were monitored from five stations. Derelict fishing gears (DFGs), including ropes (51 ± 2%) and fishing lines (43 ± 2.5%), were the dominant debris forms recorded. Among the reef-forming corals, Acropora sp. colonies experienced maximum physical injury and mortality from DFG entanglement. Plastic materials and anchors caused considerable physical damage and tissue loss in Porites sp, without any mortality. Manual debris removal as a potential debris management method was assessed by regularly removing the accumulated debris from the test reef locations of all five stations, whereas the control reef locations were left undisturbed. Test reef locations showed a significant increase in live coral cover and coral recruit density in 2020, against that in 2018, compared with the control locations. Continuous accumulation and interaction of marine debris with the coral colonies of control reef locations resulted in significant reduction of live coral cover and coral recruit density at the control reef locations. This study illustrates the impact of unsustainable fishing and other anthropogenic activities such as tourism and waste disposal on coral reef ecosystems like Palk Bay. The findings of this study demonstrates that manual removal of debris is an important strategy for marine debris management in coral reef ecosystem. Considering the importance of coral reefs in the livelihood of the coastal communities, it is important to tackle the marine debris issue through regular debris removal with stakeholder participation, awareness campaigns and strict legal and management measures. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,\n",
       " As emerging pollutants in the aquatic environments, micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) aroused widespread environmental concerns for their potential threats to the ecological health. Previous research has proved that microalgae growth could recover from the MNPs toxicities, in which the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) might play the key role. In order to comprehensively investigate the recovery process of microalgae from MNPs stress and the effecting mechanisms of EPS therein, this study conducted a series of experiments by employing two sizes (0.1 and 1 μm) of polystyrene (PS) MNPs and the marine model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana during 14 days. The results indicated: the pigments accumulations and photosynthetic recovery of T. pseudonana under MPs exposure showed in the early stage (4–5 days), while the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and EPS contents lasted longer time period (7–8 days). EPS was aggregated with MNPs particles and microalgal cells, corresponding to the increased settlement rates. More increase of soluble (SL)-EPS contents was found than bound (B)-EPS under MNPs exposure, in which the increase of the protein proportion and humic acid-like substances in SL-EPS was found, thus facilitating aggregates formation. ROS was the signaling molecule mediating the overproduction of EPS. The transcriptional results further proved the enhanced EPS biosynthesis on the molecular level. Therefore, this study elucidated the recovery pattern of microalgae from MNPs stress and linked “ROS-EPS production changes-aggregation formation” together during the growth recovery process, with important scientific and environmental significance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " With the dramatic increase in the amount of plastic waste in marine and freshwater environment, the microplastic content in freshwater lakes in cold regions, represented by Lake Ulansuhai, has increased significantly. Ice formation during the freezing period will promote the enrichment of microplastics in the ice cover. In order to deeply understand the environmental migration characteristics of microplastics in cold and frozen regions, a self-made icing device was used to simulate the freezing and thawing periods of lake water, to reveal the influence of microplastics on the growth rate and melting rate of ice thickness, and ice density. The results showed that the existence of microplastics could promote ice growth, and the ice thickness growth value showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the increase of microplastic abundance. Microplastics played an obstructive role in the melting of the ice, and with the increase of microplastic abundance, the obstructive role was more obvious. Observations of the density of ice samples under different conditions revealed that the change in ice density was dominated by the abundance of microplastics and the freezing temperature, while the particle size of microplastics had a slight impact, which was a combined effect. The microplastics abundance and icing temperature affected the process of ice formation and melting, as well as changes in the ice density. © 2024 Editorial Board Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology.

       " Microplastics (MPs) contamination of marine environments poses a significant ecological risk, although impacts on species’ realized niche spaces remain unclear. The current study investigates MPs distribution across pelagic habitats, benthic sediments, and key biota in the South Yellow Sea, China. Samples were collected via trawling across estuarine transects, and tissues were digested to extract MPs. Density gradient separations and vacuum-filtrations prepared particle extracts for ATR-FTIR and Micro-Raman spectroscopic characterization. Sampling along industrialized river transects reveals ubiquitous plastic particle presence, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 51.68 item/L seawater. Contamination levels reach their peak at station estuaries before dispersing offshore, indicating significant waste stream inputs. Importantly, MPs detected in demersal and pelagic fish species, as well as in bivalves, confirm exposure across trophic niches. Gastrointestinal tract and gill concentrations reached 0.6 items/g fresh tissue, reflecting significant biological uptake and in vivo retention. The greatest population of organisms occurred adjacent to polluted areas. Overall, distribution of MPs from polluted rivers to coastal food webs was evident, suggesting potential negative impacts on key ecological functions in this system. These findings underscore the need to develop upstream mitigation efforts so as to minimize MPs contamination in areas where nearshore and offshore niches intersect. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Seagrass beds can trap large amounts of marine debris leading to areas of accumulation, known as ‘sinks’, of anthropogenic particles. While the presence of vegetation can enhance accumulation, less is known about how the trapping effect changes from vegetated to less vegetated patches. To test this, vegetation and sediment were sampled along a vegetation percent cover gradient from the centre of seagrass beds to nearby less vegetated patches. To determine whether trapped particles can lead to increased accumulation in associated fauna, gastropods were also collected from the transects laid across this gradient. Extracted anthropogenic particles were counted and characterised. Particles were detected in all sample types and reached quantifiable limits in at least 50% of sediment and gastropod samples. There was no significant difference in the distribution of particles found in seagrass beds compared to less vegetated patches, suggesting other factors contribute to the trapping efficiency of biogenic habitats besides simply the presence or absence of vegetation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Aiming at the problems of low extraction efficiency, high false detection rate, weak Raman signal and serious interference by fluorescence signal in the detection of microplastics in marine organisms, this paper establishes a set of rapid detection methods for microplastics in organisms, including confocal Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence imaging, differential Raman spectroscopy, and rapid identification of microplastics based on the ELM modeling assistance. Firstly, to address the problem of low extraction efficiency of microplastics, we explored and optimized the digestion method of tissues, which effectively improved the digestion effect of fish tissues and excluded the influence of tissues on microplastics detection. Aiming at the problems of high misdetection rate and low pre-screening efficiency of microplastics, fluorescence imaging technology is adopted to realize the visualization and detection of microplastics, which effectively improves the detection efficiency and precision of microplastics. Based on the confocal microscopy Raman spectroscopy detection system built independently in the laboratory, using 784/785 nm as the excitation light, the differential Raman spectroscopy technique effectively excludes the interference of fluorescence signals in the Raman spectra, and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the Raman spectra, and the recovery rate of the Raman characteristic peaks in the differential Raman spectroscopy reaches 100 % compared to the traditional baseline correction method, which is 33.3 % higher than that of the baseline correction method. Finally, a microplastic identification model is constructed based on ELM to assist in realizing the rapid and accurate identification of microplastics. The more complete detection method of microplastics in marine organisms proposed in this paper can realize the rapid and nondestructive, efficient and accurate detection of microplastics in fish, which can help to further promote the development of marine microplastics monitoring technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Cigarette butts are among the most common and problematic forms of marine litter. However, there is limited research on the occurrence, abundance, and potential chemicals associated with cigarette butt waste in the environment. The study focused on investigating the occurrence, abundance, and chemical composition of cigarette butt waste on Ancol Beach, Jakarta, Indonesia, addressing a gap in knowledge regarding this prevalent and problematic form of marine litter. Despite Ancol Beach's regular cleaning efforts, cigarette butt waste was still widespread with an abundance of 1.136 pcs/m2. However, this cigarette butt waste number is still less abundant compared to other regions. Chemical analysis of the cigarette butt waste revealed the presence of various chemical groups, notably aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding and mitigating the environmental repercussions of the chemicals associated with cigarette butt waste and microplastic particles on the coastal ecosystem. Further research is urged to delve deeper into the emerging chemical pollutants present in cigarette butt waste spread in the coastal environments. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

       " Understanding microplastic exposure and effects is critical to understanding risk. Here, we used large, in-lake closed-bottom mesocosms to investigate exposure and effects on pelagic freshwater ecosystems. This article provides details about the experimental design and results on the transport of microplastics and exposure to pelagic organisms. Our experiment included three polymers of microplastics (PE, PS, and PET) ranging in density and size. Nominal concentrations ranged from 0 to 29,240 microplastics per liter on a log scale. Mesocosms enclosed natural microbial, phytoplankton, and zooplankton communities and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). We quantified and characterized microplastics in the water column and in components of the food web (biofilm on the walls, zooplankton, and fish). The microplastics in the water stratified vertically according to size and density. After 10 weeks, about 1% of the microplastics added were in the water column, 0.4% attached to biofilm on the walls, 0.01% within zooplankton, and 0.0001% in fish. Visual observations suggest the remaining >98% were in a surface slick and on the bottom. Our study suggests organisms that feed at the surface and in the benthos are likely most at risk, and demonstrates the value of measuring exposure and transport to inform experimental designs and achieve target concentrations in different matrices within toxicity tests. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Rivers are crucial channels for microplastic (MP) transport from land to water environments, underscoring the importance of studying the distribution characteristics and pollution risk levels of MPs in river water and sediment. In this study, the abundance, shape, size, color, and polymer type of MPs in water and sediment in the Yitong River were determined. The results showed that MP abundance was higher in the rainy season than in the dry period, with urban sections generally exhibiting higher MP abundance than rural areas. The MPs were predominantly fibrous, ranging from 0.05 to 1 mm in size, and primarily black and transparent in color. Eleven polymer types were identified, with polyethylene (37.27 %), polypropylene (29.09 %), and polystyrene (12.73 %) being the top three. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface of MPs was rough, with varying degrees of holes and cracks, facilitating the attachment of other pollutants. The assessment of MP pollution based on the pollution load index (PLI) method indicated slight MP pollution, with a PLI value of <10 for the water body and <1 for the sediment. The assessment of the distribution characteristics and pollution levels of MPs establishes a foundation for the comprehensive analysis of MP pollution. It offers valuable guidance for managing MP pollution in the Yitong River and provides basic data for assessing the distribution characteristics and pollution risks in mid-temperate urban rivers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a global concern that has grown ever more acute in recent years. Most research has focused on the impact of plastic pollution in marine environments. However, plastic is increasingly being detected in terrestrial and freshwater environments with key inland sources including landfills, where it is accessible to a wide range of organisms. Birds are effective bioindicators of pollutants for many reasons, including their high mobility and high intra- and interspecific variation in trophic levels. Freshwater and terrestrial bird species are under-represented in plastic pollution research compared to marine species. We reviewed 106 studies (spanning from 1994 onwards) that have detected plastics in bird species dwelling in freshwater and/or terrestrial habitats, identifying knowledge gaps. Seventy-two studies focused solely on macroplastics (fragments >5 mm), compared to 22 microplastic (fragments <5 mm) studies. A further 12 studies identified plastics as both microplastics and macroplastics. No study investigated nanoplastic (particles <100 nm) exposure. Research to date has geographical and species’ biases while ignoring nanoplastic sequestration in free-living freshwater, terrestrial and marine bird species. Building on the baseline search presented here, we urge researchers to develop and validate standardised field sampling techniques and laboratory analytical protocols such as Raman spectroscopy to allow for the quantification and identification of micro- and nanoplastics in terrestrial and freshwater environments and the species therein. Future studies should consistently report the internalised and background concentrations, types, sizes and forms of plastics. This will enable a better understanding of the sources of plastic pollution and their routes of exposure to birds of terrestrial and freshwater environments, providing a more comprehensive insight into the potential impacts on birds. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The present study employs X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze plastic samples subjected to degradation processes with the aim to gain insight on the relevant chemical processes and disclose fragmentation mechanisms. Two model plastics, namely polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE), are selected and analyzed before and after artificial UV radiation-triggered weathering, under simulated environmental hydrodynamic conditions, in fresh and marine water for different time intervals. The object of the study is to identify and quantify chemical groups possibly evidencing the occurrence of hydrolysis and oxidation reactions, which are the basis of degradation processes in the environment, determining macroplastic fragmentation. Artificially weathered plastic samples are analyzed also by Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy. Changes in surface chemistry with weathering are revealed by XPS, involving the increase in chemical moieties (hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl functionalities) which can be correlated with the degradation processes responsible for macroplastic fragmentation. On the other hand, the absence of significant modifications upon plastics weathering evidenced by Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy confirms the importance of investigating plastics surface, which represents the very first part of the materials exposed to degradation agents, thus revealing the power of XPS studies for this purpose. The XPS data on experimentally weathered particles are compared with ones obtained on microplastics collected from real marine environment for investigating the occurring degradation processes. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastics, as plastic fragments less than 5 millimeters (mm), are a global environmental concern that can provide a primary risk related to food contamination. Shellfish are marine organisms that are commonly subjected to microplastic contamination. The objectives of this study were to investigate microplastic contamination in spotted babylon (Babylonia areolata) and green mussels (Perna viridis) from supermarkets, local markets, and wholesale shops in Lampang province, Thailand. The results showed that spotted babylon and green mussels from the wholesale shop had the highest number of contaminated microplastics, with 1.67 ± 2.89 and 0.67 ± 0.58 particles/g wet weight, respectively. The average number of microplastics in the spotted babylon and green mussels were 0.89 ± 0.69 and 0.44 ± 0.19 particles/g wet weight, respectively. However, the number of microplastics was not significantly different among supermarkets, local markets, and wholesale shops (p > 0.05), and there was no significant difference between spotted babylon and green mussels (p > 0.05). The average length of microplastic particles found in spotted babylon and green mussels was 0.13 ± 0.14 and 0.12 ± 0.07 mm, respectively. The predominant fragment shape of microplastics found in spotted babylon and green mussels were 100.00% and 66.67%, respectively. The dominant colors of the microplastics found in spotted babylon and green mussels were blue (50.00%) and black (66.67%), respectively. The major microplastics detected were polypropylene (PP) in spotted babylon; PP and polyethylene terephthalate in green mussels. These polymers are commonly used in protective packaging and containers. Therefore, the findings of this study recommended microplastic prevention policies, especially regarding fishing and aquaculture sources. These policies could include monitoring the concentrations of microplastics in both wild and farmed seafood, encouraging circular design for fishing, evaluating the hazards and effects of microplastics on consumers, marking and tracking fishing gear to discourage discarding and facilitating the recovery of missing gear, and requiring the reporting of lost fishing and aquaculture gear to public authorities. © 2024, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

       " Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants of increasing concern in aquatic systems. However, little is still known about the impacts of weathered MPs on plankton at the community level after long-term exposure. In this study, we investigated the effects of weathered MPs on the structure and dynamics of a Baltic Sea planktonic community during ca. 5 weeks of exposure using a mesocosm approach (2 m3) mimicking natural conditions. MPs were obtained from micronized commercial materials of polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyamide (nylon) previously weathered by thermal ageing and sunlight exposure. The planktonic community was exposed to 2 μg L-1 and 2 mg L-1 of MPs corresponding to measured particle concentrations (10–120 μm) of 680 MPs L-1 and 680 MPs mL-1, respectively. The abundance and composition of all size classes and groups of plankton and chlorophyll concentrations were periodically analyzed throughout the experiment. The population dynamics of the studied groups showed some variations between treatments, with negative and positive effects of MPs exhibited depending on the group and exposure time. The abundance of heterotrophic bacteria, pico- and nanophytoplankton, cryptophytes, and ciliates was lower in the treatment with the higher MP concentration than in the control at the last weeks of the exposure. The chlorophyll concentration and the abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, Astromoeba, dinoflagellate, diatom, and metazooplankton were not negatively affected by the exposure to MPs and, in some cases, some groups showed even higher abundances in the MP treatments. Despite these tendencies, statistical analyses indicate that in most cases there were no statistically significant differences between treatments over the exposure period, even at very high exposure concentrations. Our results show that weathered MPs of the studied conventional plastic materials have minimal or negligible impact on planktonic communities after long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Abstract: Plastics that pollute the environment can be depleted to produce small plastic particles called microplastics. Microplastics have a wide range of negative effects on ecosystem health because they can enter food webs. This study has aimed to assess the ability of a consortium of bacteria colonizing plastic waste from Jakarta Bay to degrade polypropylene microplastics. The plastic waste was collected from 3 sampling points (Muara Kamal, Muara Angke, and Marina) and was enriched in the medium Zobell marine broth for 3d at 27 ˚C, at 125 rpm in an incubator shaker. The obtained bacterial consortium was then tested for their degrading activity on 0.2% polyethylene (PP) microplastics using Mineral Salt Medium (4.5 g/L K2HPO4, 0.2 g/L MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g/L CaCl2, 0.1 g/L NaCl, 0.002 g/L FeCl3, 0.1 g/L (NH4)2SO4) at 27 ˚C, 125 rpm for 60d. The results showed that the bacterial consortium degraded PP microplastic in the range of 2.16–6.6% (dry weight basis). Among the three sampling points, the bacterial consortium from Muara Angke exhibited the highest degradation activity. Damage to PP microplastics resulting from the bacterial degradation tests was confirmed using Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses, which showed the damage to the chemical bonds and the surface of the microplastic. These findings suggest that the Muara Angke bacterial consortium is a viable candidate for PP microplastic remediation while posing no risk to human health or the environment.

       " This paper examines the distribution and chemical properties of beached plastic pellets along the Ionian and Tyrrhenian coasts of Southern Italy. Three locations have been sampled: Agnone Bagni (SR) and Paradiso (ME) on the Ionian coast of Sicily, Baia del Tono in Milazzo (ME) on the Sicilian Tyrrhenian coast, and Pizzo Calabro (VV) in Calabria on the Tyrrhenian coast. Variations in shape, size, compactness, color, and other physical features, correlated with residence times and transport, has been highlighted. Raman spectroscopy, used in a portable configuration, enabled rapid identification of polymer types, demonstrating its utility for on-site plastic pollutant monitoring. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymers. Principal component analysis of the spectra determined the optimal chemometric classification of pellets by composition, avoiding interference or distortion. In conclusion, the study provided preliminary insights into pellet abundance, composition, weathering extent, and distribution across these shorelines, underscoring the importance of regular beach monitoring. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In the aquatic environment around the world, microplastic contamination has been a common and ongoing issue. Particularly, the ability of microplastics to absorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and then transmit these POPs to aquatic creatures has attracted a lot of interest. A stereomicroscope was used to detect the size, shape, and color of the microplastics (MPs), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify the polymer composition of the MPs. To address MP transit, destiny, and mitigation, a study of MP pollution coastal areas is required. In the current study, MP pollution in the collected sample from upper layer of water and sediment of the Digha and Puri beaches along the coast of BOB was evaluated. The average concentration with SD of MPs observed in water was 5.3 ± 1.8 items/L whereas, in sediments, it was 173.4 ± 40.1 items/kg at Digha beach. The mean MPs abundance in the Puri beach was 6.4 ± 1.7 items/L in the water and 190.4 ± 28.0 items/kg in the sediments. The investigated total 16-PAHs concentrations were 164.7 ng/g, 121.9 ng/g, 73.6 ng/g, and 101.3 ng/g on the MPs surface of foam, fragment, fibers, and film respectively in the studied MPs sample. Smaller than 1000 µm size of MPs are distributed in the largest concentration. Fibers, films, fragments, and foam were the most common shapes of MPs. The molecular structure of MPs in water and sediment samples was analysed i.e., polyesters (PEs), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), polyamide (PA), polycarbonates (PC), and polyurethane (PU). The obtained result offers an accurate assessment of the PLI, and the investigated polymer facilitates determining the polymer hazard levels, which emphasizes the risk associated with it. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.,\n",
       " Aquatic ecosystems serve as the primary reservoir for microplastics entering the environment. The assessment of the microplastics content in natural waters and sediments is a pressing task, the resolution of which is essential for evaluating the degree of pollution of water bodies, identifying sources of contamination, and assessing potential risks to aquatic inhabitants. Currently, there is no universal analytical approach to separating microplastics from natural waters and sediments for subsequent identification. This review summarizes information on the methods for sampling microplastics from natural waters and sediments and sample preparation techniques, including size- and density-based particle separation methods, as well as digestion-based methods relying on the digestion of samples to remove natural organic matter. Additionally, it outlines the classification of microplastics and provides general insights into their prevalence in aquatic ecosystems and potential toxicity. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

       " This study assessed the presence of marine litter along the beach of the city of Punta Arenas, Chile. The sampling period coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 239 plastic waste items were identified out of a total of 638 litter items. The Clean Coast Index reported within this study ranged from Clean (CCI 2-5) to Extremely dirty (CCI >20), especially near the port. The majority of litter items has been classified as originating from varied origins, as it is not possible to pinpoint a precise origin in most items. The results indicate that the predominant plastic litter in Punta Arenas is PVC.

       " Anthropogenic marine litter (AML) is a global environmental concern. One of the most conspicuous effects of AML is beach litter accumulation, the distribution of which is typically heterogenous. Little information is available on the potential effects of coastal topographic features on litter dispersal. We analysed the abundance, composition, and sources of beach litter on the East coast of England in relation to the presence of coastal groyne structures. Six beaches were surveyed in autumn and winter 2021 using the OSPAR methodology for monitoring beach litter. Litter abundance was lower on beaches with groynes present, which could infer that groynes deflect or bury AML. The presence of groynes had no significant effect on the composition/sources of beach litter. Single-use plastic packaging, fishing waste, and sewage-related debris were the largest contributors of beach litter in this region. Our findings indicate that man-made topographic features may affect marine litter dispersal and coastal accumulation. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics pose risks to marine organisms through ingestion, entanglement, and as carriers of toxic additives and environmental pollutants. Plastic pre-production pellet leachates have been shown to affect the development of sea urchins and, to some extent, mussels. The extent of those developmental effects on other animal phyla remains unknown. Here, we test the toxicity of environmental mixed nurdle samples and new PVC pellets for the embryonic development or asexual reproduction by regeneration of animals from all the major animal superphyla (Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa, Deuterostomia and Cnidaria). Our results show diverse, concentration-dependent impacts in all the species sampled for new pellets, and for molluscs and deuterostomes for environmental samples. Embryo axial formation, cell specification and, specially, morphogenesis seem to be the main processes affected by plastic leachate exposure. Our study serves as a proof of principle for the potentially catastrophic effects that increasing plastic concentrations in the oceans and other ecosystems can have across animal populations from all major animal superphyla. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) accumulate in sediments, yet guidelines for evaluating MP risks in dredged sediments are lacking. The objective of this study was to review existing literature on MPs in sediments to improve fundamental knowledge of MP exposures and develop a publicly available database of MPs in sediments. Twelve percent of the reviewed papers (nine studies) included sediment core samples with MP concentrations generally decreasing with depth, peaking in the top 15 cm. The remaining papers evaluated surficial grab samples (0 to 15 cm depth) from various water bodies with MPs detected in almost every sample. Median MP concentrations (items/kg dry sediment) increased in this order: lakes and reservoirs (184), estuarine (263), Great Lakes nearshore areas and tributaries (290), riverine (410), nearshore marine areas (487), dredge activities (817), and harbors (948). Dredging of recurrent shoaling sediments could be expected to contain MPs at various depths with concentrations influenced by the time elapsed since the last dredging event. These results offer key insights into the presence and variability of MPs in dredged sediments, informing environmental monitoring and risk assessment strategies. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.,\n",
       " Several countries have imposed either a ban or a tax on single-use plastic packaging, motivated by their contribution to marine plastic pollution. This may lead consumers to opt for similar unregulated substitutes, potentially undermining or even counteracting the intended effect of the policy instrument. The purpose of this study is to theoretically and empirically compare the environmental and welfare effects of the first-best Pigouvian taxes on both plastic bags and a substitute (paper bags), with two alternative second-best policy instruments: a tax on plastic products alone, and a common uniform tax on all packaging materials. The empirical analysis accounts for two different types of environmental externalities from the use of both bag types: marine pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It also compares results for two countries, Denmark and the USA, which differ in the demand for plastic and paper bags. The theoretical analysis shows that a unilateral tax on plastic bags should equal the marginal environmental damage of plastic bags minus a fraction of the marginal environmental cost of paper bags, hence being lower than the Pigouvian tax. The optimal common tax should equal a weighted average of the marginal environmental damage of the two bag types and would be lower than the Pigouvian tax on plastics if the marginal external cost of plastic bags exceeds that for paper bags. The empirical analysis shows that for default parameters, the variation in tax level across the studied scenarios is small. It also shows that if Pigouvian taxes cannot be implemented, a common uniform tax on both bag types would result in a higher welfare gain than a tax on plastic bags alone. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the level of the second-best taxes and their associated environmental and welfare impacts are sensitive to assumptions regarding the littering rate and decay rate of plastic bags in the marine environment. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The fate of microplastics (MPs) in the ocean is mostly driven by (i) photo-oxidation to smaller particles and dissolved constituents, which fuel the dissolved organic carbon pool (plastic-derived DOC, pDOC), and (ii) interactions with organic matter forming sinking aggregates (marine plastic snow). Two separate laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the two pathways of MPs. In the first experiment, we measured potential rates of microbial pDOC utilization in bottle incubations over 15 days with microbial assemblages from coastal and offshore waters. Microbial utilization of pDOC was more efficient in the coastal (72% bioreactive pDOC) compared with the offshore experiment (32% bioreactive pDOC) 15 days. Changes in bacterial cell abundance and extracellular enzyme activities (glucosidase, peptidase, esterases) indicated that a fraction of pDOC was repackaged into microbial exopolymeric substances (EPS), stimulating growth of known EPS degrading bacteria within the phyla Verrucomicrobiota and Planctomycetota. Microbial EPS likely also played a key role in our second experiment that showed the formation of marine plastic snow in roller tanks with cultured cells of Emiliana huxleyi but not with cells of an Isocrysis sp. culture. Average sinking velocities of marine plastic snow were a factor of 1.2 lower compared with marine snow without MPs. Both aggregate types showed reduced sinking velocities in a density stratified sinking column. Our results from the two experiments on (i) microbial utilization of pDOC and (ii) the formation and sinking of marine plastic snow indicate potential effects of plastic-derived compounds on microbial elemental cycles (i.e., pDOC repackaged into EPS) with consequences for the efficiency of the biological carbon pump (i.e., marine plastic snow reduces carbon export) and the fate of plastic-derived compounds in the ocean. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Estuaries function as temporary storage sites for plastic debris, influencing the distribution of microplastics (MPs) across ecosystems. This research delves into the presence of MPs in the water, sediment, fish, and shellfish of Ashtamudi Lake, a Ramsar wetland with brackish water located on the southwest coast of India. Given the lake's significance in supporting the livelihoods of numerous fishers and acting as a vital source of fishery resources for both local consumption and export, examining the contamination of the system by MPs becomes particularly pertinent. The highest percentage composition of MPs was found in macrofauna at 60.6% (with fish at 19.6% and shellfish at 40.9%), followed by sediment (22.8%) and water (16.7%). The primary types of MPs identified in all samples were fibers (35.6%), fragments (33.3%), and films (28%), with beads being the least represented at 3.03%. ATR-FTIR and Raman spectra analysis identified five polymers from shellfish (polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, nylon, and polyvinyl chloride), five from fish guts (nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyurethane, and polysiloxane), four in sediment (polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, rayon), and four in water samples (polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, and polystyrene). SEM-EDAX analysis of MPs obtained from the samples revealed degradation and the presence of inorganic elements such as Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Cl, P, and Ca, as well as heavy metals like Pb, Mo, Rh, Pd, Ti, and Fe. The existence of these plastic polymers and heavy metals in microplastic samples poses a threat to vulnerable biota; people consume contaminated fish and shellfish, underscoring the importance of monitoring MPs in lake water. This investigation of MPs in Ashtamudi Lake highlights the system's susceptibility to plastic pollution and the bioavailability of smaller MPs to aquatic organisms. Identified sources of MPs in the lake include fishing and aquaculture activities, sewage pollution, improper solid waste management in lake watersheds, and unsustainable tourism. Upstream and downstream management interventions are recommended to address MP pollution in Ashtamudi Lake. © 2024,\n",
       " The settling of microplastics (MPs) in the initial acceleration fall stage, i.e., before reaching the terminal settling velocity, has not been investigated, which is however important for understanding MP transport and fate. MP disks sized 3–5 mm, of three shapes and made of three polymers (1.038–1.343 g/cm3) were examined. Five release ways and three release angles (0°, 45°, 90°) were used. MP disks with the release angle of 0° start to zigzag immediately after the release, while the MP disks with the release angles of 45° and 90° first adjust to a horizontal position and then zigzag. The adjustment distances in the vertical and horizontal directions, as well as the maximum vertical settling velocity, are influenced by MP density, size, release angle and release way. The detailed settling trajectory and velocity were also analyzed. Finally, the time-changing drag coefficient of MP disks was examined and discussed. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In recent years，the environmental pollution of microplastics in Poyang Lake has received increasing attention. Baisha Lake of Poyang Lake was selected as the study area，and samples of water and sediments of Baisha Lake and the microplastics therein were collected，and the polymer types of microplastics were identified as polyethylene（PE），polyester（PET），polypropylene（PP），and polystyrene（PS）using Fourier infrared spectroscopy. We also analyzed the structural composition of bacterial communities in water，in sediments，and on microplastic surfaces using 16S high-throughput sequencing. The species richness and diversity of bacteria on the microplastic surfaces were lower than those in the surrounding water and sediments. The results of NMDS analysis showed that the bacterial community structures on the microplastic surfaces differed greatly from those in the surrounding sediments and water. The bacterial community composition in water and sediment differed from that on the microplastic surfaces，and the dominant bacterial phyla on the microplastic surfaces were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota，and their relative abundance on the microplastic surfaces was higher than that in sediment. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was higher than that in water. The relative abundances of Bacteroidota and Actinobacteriota were significantly lower than that of water. Massilia and Pseudomonas were the dominant genera on the microplastic surfaces，and their relative abundances were significantly higher than those in the surrounding water and sediments. BugBase phenotype prediction revealed that the relative abundance of contains mobile elements，biofilm formation，potential pathogenicity，and stress tolerance phenotypes of microplastic bacterial communities were significantly higher than those of the surrounding water and sediments. The results revealed that microplastics may have contributed to the spread of harmful bacteria，including pathogenic bacteria，and increased the potential pathogenicity of bacterial communities. Additionally，microplastic surface bacterial communities had higher phenotypes of mobile gene element content. Revealing the potential harm of microplastic pollution to wetland ecology at the micro level may provide a scientific reference for maintaining the ecological stability of wetlands. © 2024 Science Press.

       " Much attention regarding the environmental pollution by plastics had focused on the Oceans. More recently, contamination of freshwater ecosystems has been addressed but information from smaller rivers in moderately populated catchments is still comparatively scarce. This study explored the microplastic (MP) occurrence in the small regional river Oker, Northern Germany (catchment area 1822 km2, population of ca. 500,000, discharge approx. 12 m3 s−1). MPs (fibers and fragments in the size range 0.3–5 mm, identification by microscopy) were found in all 10 in-stream samples collected along the course of the river, ranging between 28 and 134 particles m−3 with an overall average of 63 particles m−3. This MP concentration found in the small river Oker is similar to, or higher than, that reported for larger rivers in similar environments in Central Europe. On average, higher MP concentration was found at urban (71 particles m−3) compared to rural sampling sites (51 particles m−3). Within the Oker catchment, in-stream MP concentration showed no or low correlation to the catchment-scale factors of catchment size and population. Additional samples taken from three locations directly influenced by discharges of potential MP point sources confirmed wastewater treatment plants of different capacities and an urban rainwater sewer as sources. Our results support findings that MP concentrations in small rivers are crucially influenced by local sources, superimposing linear relationships to factors of catchment size and -population. They show that even small rivers draining moderately populated catchments may exhibit comparatively high concentrations of MPs, and thereby represent underestimated pathways of MP in the environment. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Comparative microplastic (MP) data for cephalopods between oceans is scarce. Our aim was to quantify, characterise, and compare MPs in gills, digestive gland, and mantle of chokka squid from the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) and Indian Ocean (IO) off the coast of South Africa. South African squid had more MPs compared with other studies (means = 2.0 and 0.4 in SAO and IO squid mantle, respectively). Blue fibres were dominant. Identifiable MPs were polyethylene. Despite IO water having higher MP concentrations than the SAO, SAO squid had higher MP concentrations. Dilution by growth is the likely reason for the lower MP concentrations. Fibres were shorter in SAO than IO squid. However, we could not explain why fibre and mantle lengths from both oceans were positively correlated. Squid may not be the best indicator of marine MPs. The characteristics of MPs in squid can be used to track stocks and migrations. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The Fuyang River Basin，as an important water conservation area in North China，is significantly impacted by human activities. To explore the characteristics and ecological risks of microplastics in different environmental media and fish bodies in the Fuyang River（Handan section），microplastics in surface water，sediment，and fish from the Fuyang River（Handan section）were analyzed and evaluated. The results showed that the average abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Fuyang River during the dry season and the wet season was（2425±688）n·m-3 and （1781±784）n·m-3，respectively；in the sediment，it was（1200±366）n·kg-1 and（841±221）n·kg-1；and in fish bodies，it was（7.65±4.72）n·ind-1 and（3.76±2.79）n·ind-1. The analysis found that the abundance of microplastics was significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season；the content of microplastics in the surface water and sediment downstream was significantly higher than in the middle and upper reaches；the abundance of microplastics in fish bodies was highest in the stomach and intestines，followed by gills，and then muscles. Microplastics in various environmental media and fish bodies were mainly blue，black，and transparent in color，with the shapes primarily being fibers，films，and fragments，and particle sizes mainly distributed between 0.1 and 2mm. The main types of polymers were PE and PP. The microplastic risk index assessment model indicated that microplastic pollution in the Fuyang River（Handan section）was relatively severe，with risk levels between II and III，while the pollution load index assessment model suggested that the ecological risk of microplastic pollution in the surface water and sediments of the basin was relatively low. © 2024 Science Press.

       " In the context of marine litter monitoring, reporting the weight of beached litter can contribute to a better understanding of pollution sources and support clean-up activities. However, the litter scaling task requires considerable effort and specific equipment. This experimental study proposes and evaluates three methods to estimate beached litter weight from aerial images, employing different levels of litter categorization. The most promising approach (accuracy of 80 %) combined the outcomes of manual image screening with a generalized litter mean weight (14 g) derived from studies in the literature. Although the other two methods returned values of the same magnitude as the ground-truth, they were found less feasible for the aim. This study represents the first attempt to assess marine litter weight using remote sensing technology. Considering the exploratory nature of this study, further research is needed to enhance the reliability and robustness of the methods. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Found in freshwater and ocean environments, microplastics may pose hazards through chemical transfer if they are made of harmful chemicals or they can adsorb pollutants. Microplastics pollution sources include clothes washing, wastewater systems, biosolids, tire and road wear, and atmospheric particles that affect wildlife and humans. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis should more effectively remove microplastics than microfiltration and ultrafiltration, even if the membrane barriers are also made of plastics. Analytical method progress on microplastics includes quantification (enumeration and mass concentration), size characterization, and minimum thresholds for detection (size and mass). © 2024 American Water Works Association.,\n",
       " 【Objective】As one of the typical forces in the process of erosion and migration, sediment abrasion can accelerate the fragmentation of microplastics, thereby affecting microplastic migration and redistribution within the watershed. However, how sediment abrasion affects the fragmentation behavior of microplastics is still unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of sediment abrasion on the fragmentation of microplastics. 【Method】In this study, topsoil was collected from a mulched cornfield in the Wangdonggou small watershed of the Loess Plateau and the abundance, type, and morphology of microplastics were analyzed using a laser infrared imaging system after different treatments. The different treatments include air-dried original soil, sediment standstill, and sediment abrasion with three concentrations of 560 kg·m–3, 800 kg·m–3 and 930 kg·m–3. 【Result】The results showed that: (1) PU, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and Rubber (RB) were the main microplastics in the study area, mostly in the form of fragments with a diameter of 10～50 μm.(2) The average area of microplastic was largest in the air-dried soil treatment (5, 234 μm2) and the smallest (2, 067 n·kg–1) was in the sediment standstill treatment. The microplastics after sediment abrasion treatments had the greatest average abundance (14, 400 n·kg–1) and the smallest average area (2, 868 μm2). (3) The average abundance and area of microplastic under the three sediment abrasion treatments were significantly different. The average abundance of microplastic followed the pattern: moderate sediment concentration (18, 300 n·kg–1)> low sediment concentration (13, 730 n·kg–1)> high sediment concentration (8, 667 n·kg–1), whilst the average area of microplastic showed: low sediment concentration (3, 932 μm2)> moderate sediment concentration (2, 472 μm2)> high sediment concentration (2, 099 μm2). 【Conclusion】Overall, this study demonstrates that sediment abrasion significantly increased the microplastic abundance and reduced their areas, but the average abundance of microplastic reached the maximum at the moderate sediment concentration abrasion intensity. The sensitivity of different microplastic types to sediment abrasion was different, providing guiding information for the risk assessment of soil microplastic fragmentation and migration in eroding settings. © 2024 Science Press.

       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a significant concern within environmental degradation, prevalent across various ecosystems, including aquatic and terrestrial environments. Industries such as agriculture, laundry, tourism, personal care products, and cosmetics primarily contribute to MP pollution in both soil and aquatic ecosystems. The ingestion of MPs by marine and terrestrial organisms, followed by their subsequent transfer along the food chain, has been extensively documented. Additionally, the presence of MPs in the environment has potentially exacerbated climate change dynamics. Notably, studies have revealed that MPs in soils exhibit interactive effects on nitrogen and carbon cycles, leading to increased emissions of N2O by up to 37.5% and CO2 by up to 92%. Despite numerous studies highlighting MPs' abundance and adverse impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning their correlation with climate change and their broader implications for human and environmental health. While previous research has shed light on the ecological consequences of MPs, a comprehensive review addressing the correlation between MPs abundance in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and their impact on climate change and human health has yet to be presented. The present study offers a comprehensive overview of various types of MPs, their sources, impacts, and transport pathways under changing climatic conditions. The findings of this study are anticipated to contribute towards mitigating the transport of MPs within ecosystems, thereby minimizing ecological impacts and their associated greenhouse gas emissions. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is a growing concern for the earth’s terrestrial and marine environments. Synthetic fibers from textiles are one source of microplastic pollution as fibers may be released from garments during use and especially during laundering, whereby they may enter the aquatic environment via wastewater systems. Wool is a natural fiber, but it is often given treatments to enhance its performance, such as to make it resistant to shrinkage caused by machine washing. Treatments of this type might influence the fiber’s inherent biodegradability. We sought to understand the aquatic biodegradation behavior of wool (in its unmodified form, and chlorine-Hercosett shrink-resist treated) and a range of synthetic fibers that are used in similar clothing applications. The biodegradation test was carried out in a simulated marine environment using a natural seawater inoculant according to the ASTM D6691 method with some modifications. Biodegraded wool residues were characterized by Fourier transform infrared and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. The extent of fiber damage was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Both types of wool biodegraded readily under these conditions and machine-washable wool biodegraded to a greater extent than untreated wool. Regenerated cellulosic fiber (viscose rayon) also degraded readily, but all three synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon and polypropylene) showed virtually no biodegradation. Analysis of solid and liquid residues generated by the biodegraded wool showed no evidence that the chlorine-Hercosett-treated wool generated any non-degraded residues. Based on these findings we believe that, unlike synthetics, wool fibers are very unlikely to lead to microplastic pollution in the aquatic environment. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " There has been much concern about microplastic (MP) pollution in marine and soil environments, but attention is gradually shifting towards wetland ecosystems, which are a transitional zone between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This paper comprehensively reviews the sources of MPs in wetland ecosystems, as well as their occurrence characteristics, factors influencing their migration, and their effects on animals, plants, microorganisms, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It was found that MPs in wetland ecosystems originate mainly from anthropogenic sources (sewage discharge, and agricultural and industrial production) and natural sources (rainfall-runoff, atmospheric deposition, and tidal effects). The most common types and forms of MPs identified in the literature were polyethylene and polypropylene, fibers, and fragments. The migration of MPs in wetlands is influenced by both non-biological factors (the physicochemical properties of MPs, sediment characteristics, and hydrodynamic conditions) and biological factors (the adsorption and growth interception by plant roots, ingestion, and animal excretion). Furthermore, once MPs enter wetland ecosystems, they can impact the resident microorganisms, animals, and plants. They also have a role in global warming because MPs act as unique exogenous carbon sources, and can also influence GHG emissions in wetland ecosystems by affecting the microbial community structure in wetland sediments and abundance of genes associated with GHG emissions. However, further investigation is needed into the influence of MP type, size, and concentration on the GHG emissions in wetlands and the underlying mechanisms. Overall, the accumulation of MPs in wetland ecosystems can have far-reaching consequences for the local ecosystem, human health, and global climate regulation. Understanding the effects of MPs on wetland ecosystems is essential for developing effective management and mitigation strategies to safeguard these valuable and vulnerable environments. © 2024,\n",
       " Due to agricultural film fragmentation, sewage irrigation and other anthropogenic activities, the content and abundance of microplastics in soil are gradually surpassing those in the ocean, and becoming one of the main pollution sources of soil. Soil organisms can absorb soil microplastics, among which microplastics in food crops can enter the human body through the food chain, causing the risk of human microplastic exposure. In addition, soil microplastics can also directly cause toxicity to soil. The sources, migration and other environmental behavior of microplastics in soil ecosystem were summarized, and the impact of microplastics on soil ecosystem was emphasized. The results mainly include the following aspects: (1) Microplastics can migrate and transport in the soil environmental system through the space between soil particles, the root cracks of plants and the movement of animals. (2) Microplastics can affect soil physical and chemical properties, plant growth and development, animal behavior and microbial diversity. (3) Microorganisms and enzymes can degrade microplastics in the soil environment and directly reduce microplastics in the soil system, while biochar can reduce the toxicity of microplastics to the soil ecosystem. All three are potential options for soil microplastics remediation technologies. Finally, the possible research direction of soil microplastics in the future was proposed, in order to provide guidance for the pollution control of soil microplastics. © 2024 Editorial Board Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology.

       " Plastic debris is a significant and rapidly developing ecological issue in coastal marine ecosystems, especially in areas where it accumulates. This study introduces “plasticlusters”, a new form of floating debris agglomeration found in the Yasmine Hammamet marina (Tunisia, North-Africa), loosely attached to pontoon ropes around the water surface level. The analysis of two samples revealed that they were formed primarily by average 2.11 mm polystyrene fragments, 3.43 mm fibers, 104 mm polypropylene and polyethylene sheets, and 122 mm decomposing seagrass leaves. They were inhabited by several taxa, including at least 2 cryptogenic and 5 non-indigenous species (NIS). Unlike other plastic formations, plasticlusters provide a novel and potentially temporal microhabitat to fouling assemblages due to their loose and unconsolidated structure which, combined with marinas being NIS hubs, could enhance NIS dispersion. The results of this study raise concerns about the combined ecological effects of debris accumulation and biocontamination inside marinas. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The proximity of freshwater ecosystems to anthropogenic activities makes them one of the most threatened environments by plastic pollution in the form of microplastics (MPs). Therefore, it is crucial to identify the primary drivers of MP dynamics in rivers to enhance their management. This work analyzed the concentration of MPs in water and sediments and evaluated the influence of land use and its relationship with the main biotic indices employed to assess the water quality of rivers. This research was carried out in four different catchments, with three sampling points established in each river basin. The results revealed that MPs were ubiquitous across all locations, with concentrations ranging from 0.10 to 35.22 items m−3 in waters and from 26 to 643 items Kg−1 in sediments. The highest concentration of MPs both in water and sediments were found in the Lagares River (35.22 items m−3 and 643 items Kg−1), while the lowest concentrations were found in the Miñor River for water (0.10 items m−3) and Tea River for sediments (138 items Kg−1). Urbanization degree was identified as the primary driver of MP pollution in water, whereas population density correlated with sediment pollution levels. These findings explain the elevated MPs abundance in the more urbanized and populated Gafos and Lagares rivers compared to the relatively pristine Miñor and Tea rivers. Furthermore, the presence of MPs in sediments was found to negatively impact the most sensitive benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, as evidenced by lower values of the IASPT and EPT indices at sampling points with higher sediment MPs concentrations (Gafos and Lagares). © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Entanglement, often associated with the interaction of large marine plastics and larger animals, has not yet been reported in the context of microplastics (MPs) and small organisms. In this study, Daphnia magna was exposed to fibrous and fragmentary MPs at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 items/mL for 7 days. The results revealed that fibrous MPs tended to entangle with the second antennae and tail claws of D. magna, whereas fragmentary MPs merely adhered to the surface of the daphnids but do not exhibit entanglement. Additionally, the swimming speed and projected area of swimming trajectories of daphnids significantly decreased in the 100 items/mL group compared with the control. However, the occurrence of entanglement and slow swimming was less pronounced in the 1000 items/mL group due to the aggregation of fibrous MPs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that D. magna possessed a rich spine structure on the surface of their bodies, particularly on their antennae and tails. The entanglement of D. magna by fibrous MPs resembled the action of manufactured “hook and loop”. Overall, the results of this research revealed that entanglement is observed in small animals exposed to fibrous MPs, highlighting the direct biological effects of MPs beyond ingestion. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Aim: The study investigates the microplastic degradation potential of mangrove rhizobacteria and their efficiency as a consortium. Methodology: Rhizosphere sediments were collected from three common mangrove species, Avicennia sp., Acanthus sp. and Bruguiera sp. in Kerala, India. Rhizobacteria were isolated, characterized and a consortium was formulated, which were analyzed for the production of plastic-degrading enzymes. Structural changes in PVC microplastic films treated with individual cultures and consortium were determined by FTIR spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Results: The most abundant bacteria from each of the three mangrove species were identified as Priestia megaterium (SXC01) from Avicennia sp., Bacillus cereus (1MM03) from Acanthus sp. and Priestia megaterium (1MB38) from Bruguiera sp. Semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis showed that Priestia megaterium (SXC01) was efficient in the production of PEG dehydrogenase, Bacillus cereus (1MM03) in lipase production and Priestia megaterium (1MB38) in esterase and cutinase synthesis. Interestingly, the bacterial consortium showed higher production of enzymes and also exhibited greater stability in their attachment to the PVC surface compared to individual bacterial isolates. Further, FTIR spectral studies revealed pronounced vibrations in the hydroxyl (OH) regions, C-H regions and C-Cl stretching regions, providing evidence of bacterial PVC degradation. Interpretation: This study highlights the potential of consortium in the effective degradation of microplastics, surpassing individual isolates in enzymatic activity. To mitigate microplastic contamination, mangrove rhizobacteria are important players with potential uses in the restoration and maintenance of mangrove ecosystems. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India),\n",
       " San Francisco Bay’s sediment is currently monitored for a variety of contaminants; however, data regarding the microplastics (MPs) in the area are still scarce. MPs’ occurrence in sediment samples has gained recognition as a reservoir for MP accumulation. Moreover, Bay sediment is also an important matrix for monitoring because sediment tends to accumulate certain contaminants and act as a source of contaminants in the Bay food web. This study analyzed MPs ranging from 25 µm to 5 mm in surface sediment grab samples (n = 8) and two sediment core samples (n = 2 cores analyzed with 11 samples from different depths). Our findings provide an evaluation of MP levels in different regions of the bay. The MP levels detected in Bay surface grab samples ranged from 2.1 to 11.9 MPs/g dry weight (n = 8), with a mean value of 6.2 MPs/g. The most abundant morphology was fibers, followed by fragments and films. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Airborne microplastics have emerged in recent years as ubiquitous atmospheric pollutants. However, data from the Southern Hemisphere, and remote regions in particular, are sparse. Here, we report airborne microplastic deposition fluxes measured during a five-week sampling campaign at a remote site in the foothills of the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Samples were collected over 24-hour periods for the first week and for 7-day periods thereafter. On average, atmospheric microplastic (MP) deposition fluxes were six times larger during the 24-hour sampling periods (150 MP m−2 day−1) than during the 7-day sampling periods (26 MP m−2 day−1), highlighting the importance of sampling frequency and deposition collector design to limit particle resuspension. Previous studies, many of which used weekly sampling frequencies or longer, may have substantially underestimated atmospheric microplastic deposition fluxes, depending on the study design. To identify likely sources of deposited microplastics, we performed simulations with a global dispersion model coupled with an emissions inventory of airborne microplastics. Modelled deposition fluxes are in good agreement with observations, highlighting the potential for this method in tracing sources of deposited microplastics globally. Modelling indicates that sea-spray was the dominant source when microplastics underwent long-range atmospheric transport, with a small contribution from road dust. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MP) are found in marine sediments across the globe, but we are just beginning to understand their spatial distribution and assemblages. In this study, we quantified MP in Gulf of Maine, USA sediments. MP were extracted from 20 sediment samples, followed by polymer identification using Raman spectroscopy. We detected 27 polymer types and 1929 MP kg−1 wet sediment, on average. Statistical analyses showed that habitat, hydrodynamics, and station proximity were more important drivers of MP assemblages than land use or sediment characteristics. Stations closer to one another were more similar in their MP assemblages, tidal rivers had higher numbers of unique plastic polymers than open water or embayment stations, and stations closer to shore had higher numbers of MP. There was little evidence of relationships between MP assemblages and land use, sediment texture, total organic carbon, or contaminants. © 2024,\n",
       " The balance between marine health and ecosystem sustainability confronts a pressing threat from anthropogenic pollution. Estuaries are particularly susceptible to contamination, notably by anthropogenic microfibers originated from daily human activities in land and in fishing practices. This study examines the impact of anthropogenic microfibers on the whitemouth croaker in an estuarine environment of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean during cold and warm seasons. The presence of anthropogenic microfibers was revealed in 64 % of juvenile gastrointestinal tracts, and 94 % of water samples, and concentrations were influenced by factors such as temperature, bay zone, and fish body length. Blue and black anthropogenic microfibers, with a rather new physical aspect, were dominant. This study highlights the impact of microfibers in a heavily anthropized body of water, subject to federal and local regulations due to the presence of commercially significant fish species inhabiting this area. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Polystyrene foam is widely used due to its lightweight, impact resistance, and excellent thermal insulation properties. Meanwhile, weak adhesion between beads in polystyrene foam leads to fragmentation, generating a substantial amount of microplastics (<5 mm). Such polystyrene foam debris littered on beaches diminishes the aesthetic value of coastal areas, negatively impacting tourism. Due to its density lower than other plastics, polystyrene foam macroplastics float on the sea surface and, thus, they are significantly influenced by wind drag during oceanic transport. In contrast, polystyrene foam microplastics drifting beneath the sea surface are carried mostly by ocean currents. These properties of polystyrene foam macroplastics and microplastics hinder the elucidation of their transport, distribution, and fate in nature, despite their potential to adversely impact marine ecosystems. To elucidate the generation, transport, and fragmentation processes of polystyrene foam ocean plastics, we conducted concurrent visual observations and surface net towing from seven training vessels around Japan during 2014–2020. Overall, the abundances of polystyrene foam ocean plastics were higher in the Sea of Japan than in the North Pacific south of Japan. The average abundances of polystyrene foam microplastics and macroplastics were 0.33 pieces/m3 and 0.45 pieces/km, respectively, over the entire sea area around Japan. In the Sea of Japan, the peak abundances of polystyrene foam macroplastics occurred in upstream of the Tsushima Current, while the peak for microplastics occurred downstream, suggesting that continuous fragmentation occurred during transport between the two peaks. Backward-in-time particle tracking model experiments suggested that the sources of polystyrene foam macroplastics observed in the Sea of Japan included aquaculture buoys and styrene debris beached around the Tsushima Strait. The present study demonstrated that reducing the release of polystyrene foam aquaculture floats will likely diminish the abundance of ocean plastics in the Sea of Japan. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Introduction Using coral concrete made from coral aggregates instead of conventional coarse and fine aggregates and seawater instead of freshwater for island reef construction can reduce costs and shorten the construction period for the development of the marine economy. However, coral concrete has some challenges such as high brittleness, poor toughness, and limited durability, thus restricting its application in engineering. Previous studies confirm that incorporating fibers can effectively enhance the mechanical properties of concrete. Therefore, in coral concrete, some microfibers with high elastic modulus are considered to reduce the microcracks, and some macro-fibers with high fracture toughness and elongation are considered to bridge the macrocracks, enhancing its mechanical performance in multiple scales. Carbon fibers (CFs) have the maximum elasticity modulus among commonly used micro-fibers. However, replacing carbon fibers with more economical and relatively high-modulus basalt fibers (BFs) is an effective approach. In this paper, CFs and BFs were selected as microfibers. High-elongation plastic steel fibers (PSFs) were also selected as macro-fibers instead of the steel fibers most commonly used in concrete. The CFs, BFs, and PSFs were incorporated into coral concrete. The mechanical properties of the hybrid fibers-reinforced coral concrete (HFRCC) under axial compression were investigated, and the corresponding constitutive model was proposed. Methods Cement used was ordinary Portland cement P·O 42.5, adhering to the code GB175. A coarse aggregate used was a crushed coral with a continuous gradation of 5 mm to 20 mm and a tube compressive strength of 3.1 MPa. A fine aggregate used was a coral sand with a fineness modulus of 3.0. Seawater was taken from Beibu Gulf，Guangxi, China. The admixtures include a polycarboxylate superplasticizer, a hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and an antifoaming agent. The study involved sixteen mix proportions for HFRCCs with different dosages of CFs, BFs and PSFs. A uniaxial compression test was conducted on prismatic specimens with the dimensions of 100 mm×100 mm×300 mm by a model RMT-201 electro-hydraulic servo testing machine (1 500 kN). To measure the axial deformation of specimens, two LVDTs were placed in the middle of the specimen. Simultaneously, during the loading, a digital image correlation (DIC) system was arranged at the front and rear positions of the specimen to record complete deformations throughout the specimen failure. The failure process, failure modes, and stress-strain curves of the specimens were determined via uniaxial compression tests. Key parameters such as peak stress, peak strain, residual stress, and ultimate strain were extracted from the stress-strain curves. The strain field and failure process were analyzed by digital image correlation (DIC) system. In addition, a modified constitutive model suitable for HFRCC was also established based on the experimental data. Results and discussion The uniaxial compression process of HFRCC can be divided into four stages, i.e., linear elasticity, stable crack development, unstable crack propagation, and post-peak failure. Microfibers predominantly affect the crack development before the peak stage, while macro-fibers play a crucial role in the post-peak stage. In the post-peak failure stage, a combination of DIC system obtained horizontal strain distribution cloud maps reveals that HFRCC with micro-fibers exhibits a more uniform strain distribution, compared to HFRCC without fibers or with only macro-fibers. However, in HFRCC with macro-fibers, the main through crack has a width of approximately 1 mm, which is smaller than that of HFRCC without fibers or with only micro-fibers (approximately 1.5 mm). The incorporation of high-modulus microfibers and high-fracture toughness macro-fibers into coral concrete enhances its mechanical properties in multiple scales. This is attributed to a ability of micro-fibers at low dosages to form a randomly oriented fiber network in the concrete matrix. This network bridges the micro-cracks, suppresses the extension of initial cracks, and transfers stress across micro-cracks to reduce stress concentration as well as enhances the performance of the interface transition zone. However, most of them break or pull out after macro-crack formation due to the high modulus and low fracture toughness of micro-fibers. Also, macro-fibers with a higher fracture toughness can continue to bridge macro-cracks and transfer stress between them even after the formation of macro-cracks. For the both strength and toughness, HFRCC exhibits a superior performance when the volume fractions of CFs and BFs are 0.15% each, and PSFs dosage is 7 kg/m3. Compared to the coral concrete without fibers, the peak stress, peak strain, and post-peak compressive toughness of HFRCC are increased by 6.22%, 38.54% and 116.44%, respectively. A modified constitutive model suitable for HFRCC is proposed based on the CEB-FIP model and the Guo Zhenhai model, and the calculated data of the model fit well with the measured results. The damage evolution process of HFRCC investigated by the modified constitutive model reveals that the incorporation of CFs, BFs, and PSFs can synergistically delay the damage progression of coral concrete. Conclusions The uniaxial compression process of HFRCCs could be divided into four stages, i.e., linear elasticity, stable crack development, unstable crack propagation, and post-peak failure. Microfibers played a crucial role in expanding microcracks during the first three stages, showing beneficial effects on the peak stress, peak strain, and pre-peak compressive toughness. Macro-fibers acted as bridging elements for macro-cracks in the peak failure stage, demonstrating a more significant impact on the residual stress, ultimate strain, and post-peak compressive toughness. Each type of fiber had an optimal dosage level, and the reasonable dosage of fibers could generate positive synergistic effects. When only micro-fibers were added, BFs contributed more to the increase in peak stress rather than CFs, but their improvement in peak strain and compressive toughness was slightly lower than that of CFs. This indicated that for engineering applications with lower toughness requirements, it could be feasible to replace CFs entirely with more cost-effective BFs. The calculated data of the modified constitutive model aligned well with the experimental results. This work investigated the damage evolution process of HFRCC, revealing that the incorporation of CFs, BFs, and PSFs could collaboratively delay the damage progression of coral concrete. © 2024 Chinese Ceramic Society.

       " Southeast Asia (SEA) faces significant environmental challenges due to rapid population growth and economic activity. Rivers in the region are major sources of plastic waste in oceans. Concerns about their contribution have grown, but knowledge of microplastics in the area is still limited. This article compares microplastic levels in sediment and water from urban zones of three major rivers in SEA: Chao Phraya River (Thailand), Saigon River (Vietnam), and Citarum River (Indonesia). The study reveals that in all three rivers, microplastics were found, with the highest concentrations in Chao Phraya’s water (80 ± 60 items/m3) and Saigon’s sediment (9167 ± 4559 items/kg). The variations in microplastic sizes and concentrations among these rivers may be attributed to environmental factors and the exposure duration of plastic to the environment. Since these rivers are important water supply sources, rigorous land-use regulations and raising public awareness are crucial to mitigate plastic and microplastic pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Despite their remote locations, high-mountain lakes located in the Alps are vulnerable to chemical pollution. This discussion explores the important aspects of these lakes as repositories of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs), elucidating their sources and implications for both the environment and human health. In terms of the presence of POPs in high-altitude lakes of the Alps, 14 studies have been identified examining the occurrence of polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane an its metabolites, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The bulk of research on POPs in high-mountain lakes is concentrated in the Italian Alps (63%), followed by Switzerland (22%), Austria (12%), and France (3%), respectively. Sediment is predominantly investigated (65%), followed by fish (33%) and water (2%). Similarly, in relation to the presence of CECs in high-mountain lakes of the Alps, six studies have been identified investigating the occurrence of musks, perfluorinated compounds, and microplastics. Investigations into CECs predominantly occur in Switzerland (42%), France (33%), and Italy (25%), with fish samples (muscle and liver) being the primary focus (46%), followed by sediment (17%) and water (17%). Other compartments like zooplankton, frog/tadpoles, and snow remain less explored. The discussion also shed light on various pathways through which pollutants reach these remote landscapes, including atmospheric transport, glacial meltwater, and human activities. Protecting these pristine peaks demands concerted efforts encompassing ongoing research, vigilant monitoring, and dedicated conservation initiatives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The fast and reliable detection of micron-sized plastic particles from the natural marine environment is an important topic that is mostly addressed using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Due to the long (>tens of ms) integration time required to record a viable Raman signal, measurements are limited to a single point per microplastic particle or require very long acquisition times (up to tens of hours). In this work, we develop, validate, and demonstrate a compressive Raman technology using binary spectral filters and single-pixel detection that can image and classify six types of marine microplastic particles over an area of 1 mm2 with a pixel dwell time down to 1.75 ms/pixel and a spatial resolution of 1 µm. This is x10–100 faster than reported in previous studies. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics are small plastic materials often defined as those between 5 mm and 0.05 mm in size. Microplastics can have toxicological impacts on various biota, from gut blockages to the transport or leaching of toxicants used in their production or absorbed from the surrounding environment. Although microplastic research has increased significantly, microplastic research in Africa lags behind that of developed countries. South Africa is the African nation with the highest number of microplastic publications. We aimed to determine the current state of microplastic research in South Africa. A total of 46 publications on microplastics in South Africa have been produced. However, many of these publications use methods that might not be accurate in determining holistic descriptions of microplastics in the aquatic environment. Similarly, many ecologically relevant environments and species have not been investigated for microplastics in the country, including any atmospheric or terrestrial environment. We conclude that, although the research being produced in South Africa can be considered adequate, a singular standard method for sampling and assessing microplastics in South African environments is required. The production of such a standard method would be critical to use as a monitoring tool to determine and compare microplastic abundances across the country and globally. Significance: • More than 40 publications on microplastics have been produced in South Africa. • Microplastics have been discovered in multiple aquatic environments in South Africa, but have not been investigated in atmospheric or terrestrial environments. • Polymer analysis was limited in published research. • A standard method is required for comparing between studies. • Terrestrial and atmospheric microplastic studies are required. © 2024.

       " The Sahara Desert is the largest contributor of global atmospheric dust aerosols impacting regional climate, health, and ecosystems. The climate effects of these dust aerosols remain uncertain due, in part, to climate model uncertainty of Saharan source region contributions and aerosol microphysical properties. This study distinguishes source region elemental signatures of Saharan dust aerosols sampled during the 2015 Aerosols Ocean Sciences Expedition (AEROSE) in the tropical Atlantic. During the 4-week campaign, cascade impactors size-dependently collected airborne Saharan dust particulate upon glass microfiber filters. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis differentiated metal isotope concentrations within filter samples from various AEROSE dust sampling periods. Back-trajectory analysis and NOAA satellite aerosol optical depth retrievals confirmed source regions of AEROSE ’15 dust samples. Pearson correlational statistics of source region activity and dust isotope concentrations distinguished the elemental signatures of North African potential source areas (PSAs). This study confirmed that elemental indicators of these PSAs remain detectable within dust samples collected far into the marine boundary layer of the tropical Atlantic. Changes detected in dust elemental indicators occurred on sub-weekly timescales across relatively small sampling distances along the 23W parallel of the tropical Atlantic. PSA-2 emissions, covering the western coast of the Sahara, were very strongly correlated (R2 > 0.79) with Ca-44 isotope ratios in AEROSE dust samples; PSA-2.5 emissions, covering eastern Mauritania and western Mali, were very strongly correlated with K-39 ratios; PSA-3 emissions, spanning southwestern Algeria and eastern Mali, were very strongly correlated with Fe-57 and Ti-48 ratios. The abundance of Ca isotopes from PSA-2 was attributed to calcite minerals from dry lakebeds and phosphorous mining activities in Western Sahara, based on source region analysis. The correlation between K isotope ratios and PSA-2.5 was a likely indicator of illite minerals near the El Djouf Desert region, according to corroboration with mineral mapping studies. Fe and Ti ratio correlations with PSA-3 observed in this study were likely indicators of iron and titanium oxides from Sahelian sources still detectable in Atlantic Ocean observations. The rapid changes in isotope chemistry found in AEROSE dust samples provide a unique marker of Saharan source regions and their relative contributions to desert outflows in the Atlantic. These elemental indicators provide source region apportionments of Sahara Desert aerosol flux and deposition into the Atlantic Ocean, as well as a basis for model and satellite validation of Saharan dust emissions for regional climate assessments. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " The growing environmental consequences caused by plastic pollution highlight the need for a better understanding of plastic polymer cycles and their associated additives. We present a novel, comprehensive top-down method using inflow-driven dynamic probabilistic material flow analysis (DPMFA) to map the plastic cycle in coastal countries. For the first time, we covered the progressive leaching of microplastics to the environment during the use phase of products and modeled the presence of 232 plastic additives. We applied this methodology to Norway and proposed initial release pathways to different environmental compartments. 758 kt of plastics distributed among 13 different polymers was introduced to the Norwegian economy in 2020, 4.4 Mt was present in in-use stocks, and 632 kt was wasted, of which 15.2 kt (2.4%) was released to the environment with a similar share of macro- and microplastics and 4.8 kt ended up in the ocean. Our study shows tire wear rubber as a highly pollutive microplastic source, while most macroplastics originated from consumer packaging with LDPE, PP, and PET as dominant polymers. Additionally, 75 kt of plastic additives was potentially released to the environment alongside these polymers. We emphasize that upstream measures, such as consumption reduction and changes in product design, would result in the most positive impact for limiting plastic pollution. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Pollution generated by plastic waste has brought an environmental problem characterized by the omnipresence of smaller pieces of this material known as microplastics (MP). This issue was addresses by collecting samples with 250 μm pore size nets in two marine-coastal sectors of Southwestern Caribbean Sea during two contrasting seasons. Higher concentrations were found in rainy season than in dry season, reaching respectively 1.72 MP/m3 and 0.22 MP/m3. Within each sector, there were differences caused firstly by localities of higher concentrations of semi-closed water bodies localities during rainy season (Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta and La Caimanera marsh), and secondly by lower concentrations of localities with less influenced of flow rates during dry season (Salamanca and Isla Fuerte). Moreover, the lowest concentration in dry season corresponding to La Caimanera marsh reflects how the community environmental management might decrease MP pollution. In both sectors and seasons, the particles of 0.3 mm (0.3–1.4 mm) size class dominated over those of 1.4 mm (1.4–5.0 mm) (reaching each respectively 1.33 MP/m3 and 0.39 MP/m3), with a dominance of fibers, except in the rainy season in Magdalena, where they were films. Using the FTIR technique, polypropylene was identified as the most abundant polymer in both sectors. The composition of the assemblage of microorganisms attached to microplastics presented higher richness and differed from that of free-living planktonic microbes. The most abundant members of the plastisphere were proteobacteria whose major representation was the pathogenic genus Vibrio, while the cyanobacteria dominated in seawater samples. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In coastal areas, the surface water has been simultaneously exposed to the algae blooms caused by eutrophication and the microplastics (MPs) pollution originating from active human activities. As a practical alternative to address these issues in drinking water plant, coagulation-ultrafiltration combined process is still confronted with the limited understanding about the comprehensive effects of MPs on algae-laden surface water (ASW) treatment. Considering the migration of MPs in nature environment and drinking water treatment process, this study first aims to systematically investigate the influence of MPs on algae cultivation, coagulation performance and membrane fouling development. The results of algae cultivation indicate that MPs stimulated the algae activity by 58 % and then constantly suppressed the secretion of protein-like, humic-like and polysaccharide-like metabolites. The variation of particle size distribution and zeta potential confirm that MPs acted as nuclei to facilitate the development of large coagulation flocs with an increasing average size from 82.6 μm to 107.6 μm, during which the negatively charged pollutants were neutralized and removed from ASW. According to the SEM images, MPs could destroy the structure of fouling layer on 50 kDa membranes during the filtration of ASW coagulation effluent. Its synergistic effect with the enhanced coagulation performance and the suppressed EOM secretion contributed to the alleviation of membrane fouling caused by overlapped large-sized foulants. However, the interaction between the enriched organic foulants by MPs and the deposited coagulants on 300 kDa membranes facilitated the development of cake layer, leading to the deterioration of membrane permeability. This study emphasizes the importance in concerning the existence of MPs during the treatment of ASW by coagulation-ultrafiltration combined process and their exact influence in water purification efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Given the widespread use of esters and polyesters in products like cosmetics, fishing nets, lubricants and adhesives, whose specific application(s) may cause their dispersion in open environments, there is a critical need for stringent eco-design criteria based on biodegradability and ecotoxicity evidence. Our approach integrates experimental and computational methods based on short oligomers, offering a screening tool for the rapid identification of sustainable monomers and oligomers, with a special focus on bio-based alternates. We provide insights into the relationships between the chemical structure and properties of bio-based oligomers in terms of biodegradability in marine environments and toxicity in benchmark organisms. The experimental results reveal that the considered aromatic monomers (terephthalic acid and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid) accumulate under the tested conditions (OECD 306), although some slight biodegradation is observable when the inoculum derives from sites affected by industrial and urban pollution, which suggests that ecosystems adapt to non-natural chemical pollutants. While clean seas are more susceptible to toxic chemical buildup, biotic catalytic activities offer promise for plastic pollution mitigation. Without prejudice to the fact that biodegradability inherently signifies a desirable trait in plastic products, nor that it automatically grants them a sustainable “license”, this study is intended to facilitate the rational design of new polymers and materials on the basis of specific uses and applications. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Comprehensive methodologies for monitoring microplastics (MPs) in the ocean are critical for accurately assessing abundances across a broad size spectrum, and to document distributions, sources, sinks, temporal trends, and exposure risks for organisms. Discrete 0.5-L water samples from the northeastern-coast of Venezuela (NECV), Pacific-Arctic Ocean (PAO), and Gulf Stream Current (GSC) were analyzed by Raman microspectroscopy to detect MPs not captured by net-tow surveys. Equivalent spherical diameters (ESD) of most MPs were <5 μm, accounting for 68, 83, 86 % of total inventories in NECV, GSC, PAO samples. We did not observe a single MP particle >53 μm ESD. Abundances of MPs in the 0.5–200 μm size fraction were 5–6 orders of magnitude higher than previous surveys that were almost exclusively based on net tow collections of MPs > 300 μm ESD. Abundances of MPs in NECV samples were ~10-fold higher than those from PAO and GSC. The most abundant polymers were polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), consistent with composition of plastic waste generated globally. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The fast development of China’s urbanization has led to a notable release of emerging pollutants, including microplastics (MPs) and endocrine disruptors (EDCs). Generally, these pollutants enter the coastal environment through the discharge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and finally threaten the organisms in the receiving waterbody. The study investigated the environmental behavior of MPs and EDCs in two typical WWTPs in one of the megacities in China, Shanghai. The abundance of MPs in the influent ranged from 321 to 976 items/L. Four shapes (films, fragments, fibers, and microbead) were found, while fibers and films dominated. Transparent (31–63%) and white (20–47%) MPs were more frequently observed, while polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose, and cellophane were the main polymetric materials. The size of the MPs fell between 15.8 μm and 2220 μm, and the smaller one (<500 μm) dominated. The removal efficiencies of the two WWTPs for MPs ranged from 64% to 92%, and both WWTPs performed better for large pieces of MPs (>500 μm). For EDCs, total concentrations in the influent were detected, ranging from 113 to 2780 ng/L. Two groups, including phenolic estrogens (PEs) and steroid estrogens (SEs), were detected, and PEs, especially bisphenol A (BPA), were the predominant individuals among the studied EDCs. Specifically, PEs ranged from 82.8 to 2637 ng/L, while SEs ranged from 27.3 to 143 ng/L. The removal efficiencies of the WWTPs for EDCs varied (82.8–100%) as well, possibly due to the different treatment compartments and contamination load in the influent. Seasonal variations for both MPs and EDCs were observed. Specifically, concentrations of MPs and EDCs in WWTPs influent were higher in the wet season, as well as the removal efficiency. Furthermore, there was a correlation observed between the concentrations of MPs and EDCs, suggesting that MPs and EDCs may originate from the same source and that EDCs released by MPs cannot be ignored during treatment. Finally, the study evaluated the environmental risk of the effluents. MPs led to a minor risk (Level I), while EDCs might lead to an adverse impact on algae (RQs = 0.0014–0.024) and fish (RQs = 3.4–30.2). In summary, WWTPs received considerable amounts of MPs and EDCs. Although the WWTPs removed the contaminants efficiently, the environmental risk of the effluent needs to be noted. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) contamination in seafood, particularly processed varieties like dried and salt-cured fish, poses a significant threat to human health. This study investigated MP levels in 22 salt-cured fish species and commercial sea salts along the Indian east coast. Results showed substantially higher MP concentrations compared to global averages, with fragments and fibres (< 250 µm) composing 70% of identified MPs, primarily PVC and PS polymers (> 55%). Station 2 exhibited high pollution levels, with salt-cured fish averaging 54.06 ± 14.48 MP items/g and salt containing 23.53 ± 4.2 MP items/g, indicating a high hazard risk index. A modest correlation was observed between MP abundance, morphotypes, polymer composition in the salt, and their impact on fish products. Given the critical link between food safety, security, and public health, further research is imperative to mitigate MP contamination, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 14, and Goal 15) for enhanced food safety and security.

       " Microplastic (MP) contamination represents an issue of global concern for both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but only in recent years, the study of MPs has been focused on freshwaters. Several monitoring surveys have detected the presence of a wide array of MPs differing in size, shape, and polymer composition in rivers and lakes worldwide. Because of their role of sink for plastic particles, the abundance of MPs was investigated in waters, and deep and shoreline sediments from diverse lakes, confirming the ubiquity of this contamination. Although diverse factors, including those concerning anthropogenic activities and physical characteristics of lakes, have been supposed to affect MP abundances, very few studies have directly addressed these links. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the levels of MP contamination in mountain and subalpine lakes from Northern Italy. Fourteen lakes dislocated at different altitudes and characterized by dissimilar anthropic pressures were visited. Lakeshore sediments were collected close to the drift line to assess MPs contamination. Our results showed the presence of MPs in lakeshore sediments from all the lakes, with a mean (± standard deviation) expressed as MPs/Kg dry sediment accounting to 14.42 ± 13.31 (range 1.57–61.53), while expressed as MPs/m2, it was 176.07 ± 172.83 (range 25.00–666.67). The MP abundance measured for Garda Lake was significantly higher compared to all the other ones (F1,13 = 7.344; P < 0.001). The pattern of contamination was dominated by fibers in all the lakes, but they were the main contributors in mountain lakes. These findings showed that the MP abundance varied according to the altitude of the lakes, with higher levels measured in subalpine lakes located at low altitudes and surrounded by populated areas. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics pollution is killing human life, contaminating our oceans, and lasting for longer in the environment than it is used. Microplastics have contaminated the geochemistry and turned the water system into trash barrel. Its detection in water is easy in comparison to soil and air so the attention of researchers is focused on it for now. Being very small in size, microplastics can easily cross the water filtration system and end up in the ocean or lakes and become the prospective challenge to aquatic life.

       " Coastal waters are complex and dynamic areas with unique environmental attributes that complicate the vertical migration of microplastics (MPs). The MPs that enter coastal waters from diverse sources, including terrestrial, riverine, oceanic, and shoreline inputs undergo various aging pathways. In this study, the variations in the physiochemical characteristics of MPs undergoing various aging pathways and their vertical migration under dynamic conditions subjected to the effects of different MP characteristics and coastal environmental features were comprehensively explored. Opposite effects of aging on the vertical migration of hydrophobic and hydrophilic MPs were observed, with aging appearing to promote the dispersion of hydrophobic MPs but enhance the vertical migration of hydrophilic ones. The positive role of salinity and the negative role of humic acid (HA) concentrations on MP vertical migration were identified, and the mechanisms driving these effects were analyzed. Notably, intense turbulence not only promoted the floating of positively buoyant MPs but also reversed the migration direction of negatively buoyant MPs from downward to upward. Aging-induced changes in MP characteristics had a limited effect on MP vertical migration. The inherent characteristics of MPs and the surrounding environmental features, however, played major roles in their vertical migration dynamics. Environmental Implication: Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a significant global environmental concern and the coastal zones are the hotspots for MP pollution due to their high population density. This study comprehensively investigated the variations in the physiochemical characteristics of MPs undergoing various aging pathways. Their vertical migration patterns under dynamic conditions subjected to the effects of different MP characteristics and coastal environmental features were revealed. The roles of turbulence and MP density in their migration were identified. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the transport and determining the ecological risks of MPs in coastal waters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " A growing evidence showed that the terrestrial ecosystem was a greater sink for microplastics (MPs) compared with ocean. Owing to the limitation of pretreatment methods, there are few reports on the identification of small-sized MPs(<60 μm) in soil currently, which may led to an underestimation of the environmental risk of MPs in soil system. In this study, we established an efficient pretreatment method for MPs in soils by developing a novel device, Plastic Flotation and Separator system (PFSS). The device integrated the suspension, digestion and filtration procedures into one system, reducing the losses of pretreatment process. It was shown that the recovery of MPs with size of 45 μm was 90%, significantly surpassing that of the traditional pretreatment methods in this particle size range. Combined with the SEM-Raman technique, MPs with small size were accurately determined. This work provides an effective method for the extraction and determination of MPs in soils and is of significance for the risk assessment of MPs in soil system. © 2024,\n",
       " Bisphenol A (BPA), as a typical leachable additive from microplastics and one of the most productive bulk chemicals, is widely distributed in sediments, sewers, and wastewater treatment plants, where active sulfur cycling takes place. However, the effect of BPA on sulfur transformation, particularly toxic H2S production, has been previously overlooked. This work found that BPA at environmentally relevant levels (i.e., 50-200 mg/kg total suspended solids, TSS) promoted the release of soluble sulfur compounds and increased H2S gas production by 14.3-31.9%. The tryptophan-like proteins of microbe extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) can spontaneously adsorb BPA, which is an enthalpy-driven reaction (ΔH = −513.5 kJ mol-1, ΔS = −1.60 kJ mol-1K -1, and ΔG = −19.52 kJ mol-1 at 35 °C). This binding changed the composition and structure of EPSs, which improved the direct electron transfer capacity of EPSs, thereby promoting the bioprocesses of organic sulfur hydrolysis and sulfate reduction. In addition, BPA presence enriched the functional microbes (e.g., Desulfovibrio and Desulfuromonas) responsible for organic sulfur mineralization and inorganic sulfate reduction and increased the abundance of related genes involved in ATP-binding cassette transporters and sulfur metabolism (e.g., Sat and AspB), which promoted anaerobic sulfur transformation. This work deepens our understanding of the interaction between BPA and sulfur transformation occurring in anaerobic environments. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Geosynthetics are widely used in various civil engineering applications, such as geotextiles in coastal protection, and display a sustainable alternative to natural mineral materials. However, the full benefits of using geosynthetics can only be gained with a long service lifetime of the products. With the use of added stabilizers to the polymers, service lifetimes can be achieved in the range of 100 years. Therefore, accelerated aging methods are needed for the assessment of the long-term performance of geotextiles. In the present study, the behavior of geosynthetic materials made of polypropylene was investigated under artificial aging conditions involving elevated temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 °C, increased oxygen pressures ranging from 10 to 50 bar in water-filled autoclaves, and UV irradiation under atmospheric conditions. ATR-IR spectroscopy was employed to detect the increase in the carbonyl index over various aging durations, indicating the oxidative degradation of the geotextile. The most pronounced increase was observed in the case of aging through UV irradiation, followed by thermal aging. Elevated pressure, on the other hand, had a lower impact on oxidation. High-temperature size exclusion chromatography was utilized to follow the reduction in molar mass under different degradation conditions, and the results were consistent with those obtained from ATR-IR spectroscopy. In polyolefins such as polypropylene, Hindered Amine Stabilizers (HAS) are used to suppress oxidation caused by UV radiation. The quantitative analysis of HAS was carried out using a UV/Vis method and HPLC. The degradation of UV stabilizers during the aging of geotextiles is responsible for the oxidation and the reduction in the molar mass of polypropylene. From the results, it can be concluded that applications of PP geotextile without soil or sand cover might cause the risk of the formation of microplastic particles. Material selection, design, and maintenance of the construction must follow best practices, including the system’s removal or replacement at end-of-life. Otherwise, a sustainable use of geotextiles in civil engineering is not possible. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " This study investigates the sedimentation behaviors of microplastics (MPs) within a typical meso-scale river estuary, the Yalu River Estuary (YRE) and its riverine reservoir. It analyzes sediment cores in two habitats of Yalu River, revealing changing MPs abundance over time. Results highlight significant differences in riverine and estuarine MPs deposition. Reservoir sample contains more MPs in fragments. Color variations are notable in estuarine samples but minimal in reservoir sample. After 1980, estuarine cores show an increase in coarser MPs, likely due to growth of aquaculture activities. Although sediment accumulates at 1/10 of the rate in reservoir compared to estuary, MPs in reservoir sediments exceeds estuarine level by over threefold. A possible mechanistic framework is then proposed to discuss the varying MPs behaviors in the two habitats, indicating reservoirs accumulate MPs at a higher rate due to the barrier effect of an upper-stream reservoir, stable hydrodynamics, and weak salinity-induced buoyancy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Pyroplastic, plastiglomerates, anthropogenic rocks, plasticrusts, pebble clasts, plastitar, plastisoil and anthropoquinas are examples of terms that have been used to describe the secondary products of plastic litter that have been melted, moulded, pressed, or cemented together with other plastic litter and/or minerogenic sediments or organic matter, either naturally or anthropogenically. Such processes may also favor the formation of new geological features containing plastics, such as coastal landforms or sedimentary rocks. Further research and classification of this secondary plastic litter is critical for understanding the implications of this emerging contaminant as well as to create well-targeted measures to reduce it. The literature review as presented includes 32 peer-reviewed articles published between 1997 and June 2023, all of which describe various burnt or otherwise remoulded plastic litter from around the world. Based on our review we propose a new umbrella term for the different forms of secondary plastic litter that have been modified by heat or pressure: Remoulded Plastic Litter (RPL). If accepted by the research community, important steps for future research and policy will be to implement RPL into the OSPAR protocol for monitoring and assessment of marine litter and thereby fill knowledge gaps of the geographic distribution of RPLs and their potential toxicities to nature and humans. It is clear that the distribution of RPL research spans the globe, however, studies in Africa, Oceania, large tracts of the polar regions, and terrestrial areas in general, are scarce to absent, as are ecotoxicological studies and recommendations for policy development. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " The presence of plastic particles in oceans has been recognized as a major environmental concern. The decrease in particle size increases their ability to directly interact with biota, with particles in the nanometer size range (nanoplastics—NPs) displaying a higher ability to penetrate biological membranes, which increases with the decrease in particle size. This study aimed to evaluate the role of life stages in the effects of poly(methyl)methacrylate (PMMA) NPs on the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, a key species in the marine food web and nutrient cycle. Thus, behavioral (burrowing activity in clean and spiked sediment) and biochemical endpoints (neurotransmission, energy reserves, antioxidant defenses, and oxidative damage) were assessed in juvenile and adult organisms after 10 days of exposure to spiked sediment (between 0.5 and 128 mg PMMA NPs/Kg sediment). Overall, the results show that H. diversicolor is sensitive to the presence of PMMA NPs. In juveniles, exposed organisms took longer to burrow in sediment, with significant differences from the controls being observed at all tested concentrations when the test was performed with clean sediment, whereas in PMMA NP-spiked sediment, effects were only found at the concentrations 8, 32, and 128 mg PMMA NPs/Kg sediment. Adults displayed lower sensitivity, with differences to controls being found, for both sediment types, at 8, 32, and 128 mg PMMA NPs/Kg sediment. In terms of Acetylcholinesterase, used as a marker of effects on neurotransmission, juveniles and adults displayed opposite trends, with exposed juveniles displaying increased activity (suggesting apoptosis), whereas in adults, overall decreased activity was found. Energy-related parameters revealed a generally similar pattern (increase in exposed organisms) and higher sensitivity in juveniles (significant effects even at the lower concentrations). NPs also demonstrated the ability to increase antioxidant defenses (higher in juveniles), with oxidative damage only being found in terms of protein carbonylation (all tested NPs conditions) in juveniles. Overall, the data reveal the potential of PMMA NPs to affect behavior and induce toxic effects in H. diversicolor, with greater effects in juveniles. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " The Thermaikos Gulf (TG) is a semi-enclosed, river-influenced, marine system situated in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, sustaining both urban coastal regions and ecologically preserved natural areas. Facing a plethora of environmental and anthropogenic pressures, the TG serves as a critical nexus where human activities intersect with marine ecosystems. The quality and health of the TG’s marine environment are tightly linked to the socioeconomic activities of the coastal communities comprising approximately 1.5 million inhabitants. The main features of the TG’s environmental dynamics and ecological status have been scrutinized by dedicated research endeavors during the last 50 years. This review synthesizes the seminal findings of these investigations, offering an evaluation of their contribution to research, their present collective impact, and their trajectory toward the future. A severe deterioration of the TG’s environmental quality was detected in the 1970s and 1980s when the treatment of urban wastewater was completely absent. A steady trend of recovery was observed after the 1990s; however, so far, the goal of a “good environmental state” mandated by national legislation and European directives has not been achieved. A clear reduction in research was detected after 2010, associated with the recession of the Greek economy, following the “golden period” for research in the TG from the mid-1990s until the late 2000s. The most important research gaps and uncertainties are discussed, while specific targeted recommendations for the improvement of monitoring and understanding of the physical, biochemical, and ecological state of the gulf are provided: (i) increase in permanent observational stations (temporally and spatially); (ii) inclusion of all major environmental parameters; (iii) monitoring of the quantity and quality of all land-originated freshwater discharges; (iv) monitoring and management of important aspects of the marine environment that have received minimal attention in the past (e.g., coastal erosion, plastic pollution); (v) development of accurate prediction tools (e.g., numerical techniques) to support first-level responders and efficient management; (vi) establishment of a supervising public entity that would support the holistic overview and management of the entire TG. These suggestions are directed at overcoming the existing uncertainties in the knowledge of the TG, safeguarding its ecological integrity and its role as a crucial link to marine biodiversity and sustainability in the Mediterranean basin. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Composition, and density of marine litter and associated macrofouling organisms was assessed in the continental shelf of the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea. A total of 943 litter items weighing 388 kg were collected during 34 hauls. Plastic comprised 72 % of the total litter found on the seafloor. The mean number and weight of ML was 4241 ± 1333 items/km2 and 368 ± 87 kg/km2. Depth and distance from the shore were not identified as a significant factor affecting both the number and weight of litter. A total of 20 fouling species and eggs belonging to Mollusca, Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa, Annelida, Arthropoda, and Chordata were found on marine litter. An alien Mollusca species Pinctada imbricate was also found on plastic litter. Our results confirmed that marine litter is a vector transporting a variety of organisms including alien species and being a threat for the biodiversity and human health in the Mediterranean Sea. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The synthetic hormone 17α ethinyl estradiol (EE2) is a molecule widely used in female contraceptives and recognized as a contaminant of attention (Watch List) in the European Union due to its high consumption, endocrine effects and occurrence in aquatic environments. Its main source of introduction is domestic sewage where it can be associated with other contaminants such as microplastics (MPs). Due to their characteristics, they can combine with each other and exacerbate their isolated effects on biota. This study evaluated the combined effects of microplastics (MPs) and 17α ethinylestradiol (EE2) on two tropical estuarine invertebrate species: Crassostrea gasar and Ucides cordatus. Polyethylene particles were spiked with EE2 and organisms were exposed to three treatments, categorized into three groups: control group (C), virgin microplastics (MPs), and spiked microplastics with EE2 (MPEs). All treatments were evaluated after 3 and 7 days of exposure. Oysters exhibited changes in phase 2 enzymes and the antioxidant system, oxidative stress in the gills, and reduced lysosomal membrane stability after exposure to MPs and MPEs. Crabs exposed to MPs and MPEs after seven days showed changes in phase 1 enzymes in the gills and changes in phases 1 and 2 enzymes in the hepatopancreas, such as disturbed cellular health. The combined effects of microplastics and EE2 increased the toxicity experienced by organisms, which may trigger effects at higher levels of biological organization, leading to ecological disturbances in tropical coastal ecosystems. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Most advances in the remote sensing of floating marine plastic litter have been made using passive remote-sensing techniques in the visible (VIS) to short-wave-infrared (SWIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum based on the spectral absorption features of plastic surfaces. In this paper, we present developments of new and emerging remote-sensing technologies of marine plastic litter such as passive techniques: fluid lensing, multi-angle polarimetry, and thermal infrared sensing (TIS); and active techniques: light detection and ranging (LiDAR), multispectral imaging detection and active reflectance (MiDAR), and radio detection and ranging (RADAR). Our review of the detection capabilities and limitations of the different sensing technologies shows that each has their own weaknesses and strengths, and that there is not one single sensing technique that applies to all kinds of marine litter under every different condition in the aquatic environment. Rather, we should focus on the synergy between different technologies to detect marine plastic litter and potentially the use of proxies to estimate its presence. Therefore, in addition to further developing remote-sensing techniques, more research is needed in the composition of marine litter and the relationships between marine plastic litter and their proxies. In this paper, we propose a common vocabulary to help the community to translate concepts among different disciplines and techniques. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Plant invasions and microplastics (MPs) have significantly altered the structure and function of aquatic habitats worldwide, resulting in severe damage to aquatic ecosystem health. However, the effects of MPs on plant invasion and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we conducted mesocosm experiments over a 90-day period to assess the effects of polystyrene microplastics on the invasion of exotic submerged macrophytes, sediment physicochemical properties, and sediment bacterial communities. Our results showed that PS-MPs significantly promoted the performance of functional traits and the invasive ability of exotic submerged macrophytes, while native plants remained unaffected. Moreover, PS-MPs addition significantly decreased sediment pH while increasing sediment carbon and nitrogen content. Additionally, MPs increased the diversity of sediment bacterial community but inhibited its structural stability, thereby impacting sediment bacterial multifunctionality to varying degrees. Importantly, we identified sediment properties, bacterial composition, and bacterial multifunctionality as key mediators that greatly enhance the invasion of exotic submerged macrophytes. These findings provide compelling evidence that the increase in MPs may exacerbate the invasion risk of exotic submerged macrophytes through multiple pathways. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the ecological impacts of MPs on aquatic plant invasion and the health of aquatic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in the ocean is a severe environmental problem worldwide because rivers carry plastic waste from human activities, harming the ocean’s health, ecosystems, and people. Therefore, monitoring the amount of plastic waste flowing from rivers and streams worldwide is crucial. In response to this issue of river-floating waste, our present research aimed to develop an automated waste measurement method tailored for real rivers. To achieve this, we considered three scenarios: clear visibility, partially submerged waste, and collective mass. We proposed the use of object detection and tracking techniques based on deep learning architectures, specifically the You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) and Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric (DeepSORT). The types of waste classified in this research included cans, cartons, plastic bottles, foams, glasses, papers, and plastics in laboratory flume experiments. Our results demonstrated that the refined YOLOv5, when applied to river-floating waste images, achieved high classification accuracy, with 88% or more for the mean average precision. The floating waste tracking using DeepSORT also attained F1 scores high enough for accurate waste counting. Furthermore, we evaluated the proposed method across the three different scenarios, each achieving an 80% accuracy rate, suggesting its potential applicability in real river environments. These results strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method, leveraging the two deep learning architectures for detecting and tracking river-floating waste with high accuracy. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution poses a significant environmental threat, particularly to marine ecosystems, as conventional plastics persist without degradation, accumulating plastic waste in landfills and natural environments. A promising alternative to address this issue involves the use of hydrogen donor solvents in plastic liquefaction, offering a dual benefit of waste reduction and the generation of valuable liquid products with diverse industrial applications. This review delves into plastic recycling methods with a specific focus on liquefaction using hydrogen donating solvents as an innovative approach to waste management. Liquefaction, conducted at moderate to high temperatures (280–450 °C) and pressures (7–30 MPa), yields high oil conversion using various solvents. This study examined the performance of hydrogen-donating solvents, including water, alcohols, decalin, and cyclohexane, in enhancing the oil yield while minimising the oxygen content. Supercritical water, recognised for its effective plastic degradation and chemical production capabilities, and alcohols, with their alkylating and hydrogen-donating properties, have emerged as key solvents in plastic liquefaction. The use of hydrogen donor solvents stabilizes the free radicals, enhancing the conversion of plastic waste into valuable products. In addition, this review addresses the economic efficiency of the liquefaction process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Antarctica stands as one of the most isolated and pristine regions on our planet. Regardless, recent studies have evidenced the presence of plastic pollution in Antarctic environments and biota. While these findings are alarming and put into perspective the reach of plastic pollution, it is necessary to assess the current knowledge of plastic pollution in Antarctica. In the present review, an updated literature review of plastic pollution in multiple Antarctic environmental compartments and biota was conducted. Studies were cataloged based on environmental compartments (e.g., sediments, seawater, soil, atmosphere) and biota from different ecological niches. A detailed analysis of the main findings, as well as the flaws and shortcomings across studies, was conducted. In general terms, several studies have shown a lack of adequate sampling and analytical procedures for plastic research (particularly in the case of microplastics) and standard procedures; thus, compromising the reliability of the data reported and comparability across studies. Aiming to guide future studies and highlight research needs, a list of knowledge gaps and recommendations were provided based on the analysis and discussion of the literature and following standardized procedures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution is a growing global issue due to its potential threat to ecosystem and human health. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MP is the most common type of plastics polluting agricultural soils, negatively affecting soil-microbial-plant systems. However, the effects of LDPE MPs on the carbon (C): nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) of soil-microbial-plant systems have not been well elucidated. Thus, we conducted a pot experiment with varying LDPE MP concentrations (w/w) (control without MPs; 0.2 % MPs (PE1); 5 % MPs (PE2); and 10 % MPs (PE3)) to study their effects on soil-microbial-plant C-N-P stoichiometry. Soil C:N ratio increased 2.3 and 3.4 times in PE2 and PE3, respectively. Soil C:P ratio increased 2.2 and 3.6 times in PE2 and PE3, respectively. Soil microbial C:N ratios decreased by 46.2 % in PE1, while C:P ratios decreased by 59.2, 38.6, and 67.9 % in PE1, PE2, and PE3, respectively. Soil microbial N:P ratio decreased in PE1 (17.2) and PE3 (59.1 %). MPs increased shoot C content and C:N ratios, particularly at the 5 % MP addition rate. MP addition altered dissolved organic C, N, and P concentrations, depending on the MP addition rate. Microbial community responses to MP exposure were complex, leading to variable effects on different microbial groups at different MP addition rates. Structural equation modeling showed that MP addition had a direct positive effect (β = 0.96) on soil C-N-P stoichiometry and a direct negative effect (β = −1.34) on microbial C-N-P stoichiometry. These findings demonstrate the complex interactions between MPs, soil microorganisms, and nutrient dynamics, highlighting the need for further research to better understand the ecological implications of MP pollution in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " This study aims to explore microplastic contamination in the sediments of Benoa Bay. Eight locations were sampled, with four duplications denoting the rainy and dry seasons. Based on observations, the microplastic concentration varied from 9.51 to 90.60 particles/kg with an average of 31.08 ± 21.53 particles/kg. The area near the landfill had the highest abundance, while the inlet and center of Benoa Bay and the Sama River had the lowest concentration. The fragments (52.2 %) and large microplastic sizes (64.7 %) were the most documented particles. We also identified 17 polymers, which dominated (37.5 %) by polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. There were no appreciable variations in abundance between seasons, although there were substantial variations in shape and size. Comprehensive investigation, adequate policies, continuous monitoring, and reducing waste from land- and sea-based sources that engage various stakeholders must be implemented urgently to prevent the release of microplastic into the aquatic ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This paper addresses several important problems and methods related to studies of inland waters based on the existing scientific literature. The use of UAVs in freshwater monitoring is described, including recent contact and non-contact solutions. Due to a decline in biological diversity in many parts of the globe, the main threats are described together with a modern method for algae and cyanobacteria monitoring utilizing chlorophyll a fluorescence. Observed disturbances in the functioning of river biocenoses related to mine waters’ discharge, causing changes in the physico-chemical parameters of waters and sediments, give rise to the need to develop more accurate methods for the assessment of this phenomenon. Important problems occurring in the context of microplastic detection, including the lack of unification, standardization and repeatability of the methods used, were described. In conclusion, accurate results in the monitoring of water quality parameters of inland waters can be achieved by combining modern methods and using non-contact solutions. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " This study successionally monitored how nano- and micro-sized polystyrene beads (MNPs) influence larval mortality, growth, and attachment behavior of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas related to MNP diameter and concentration. D-shaped larvae were sequentially exposed to three-diameter MNPs (0.55, 3.00, 6.00 µm) at five concentrations (0, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 20 μg/mL), and their mortality, growth stages and attachment were observed daily until they die. In addition, MNP intake and accumulation in larvae at each growth stage were determined using fluorescent beads. Deterioration in larval growth and survival was observed under all the exposure conditions, while significant negative effects on the growth parameters were defined with smaller MNPs at lower concentrations. Fluorescent signals were detected in larval digestive tracts at all except D-shaped larval stage, and on the mantle and foot in pediveligers. Therefore, MNP intake adversely affects larval physiological conditions by the synchronal effects of MNP size and concentration. Our findings highlight the implications of MNP characteristics on Pacific oyster larvae, emphasizing the interplay between size, concentration, and physiological responses, crucial for mitigating nanoparticle pollution in marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Background: Microplastic (MP) pollution has emerged as a significant environmental concern worldwide. While extensive research has focused on their presence in marine organisms and ecosystems, their potential impact on human health, particularly on the circulatory system, remains understudied. This project aimed to identify and quantify the mass concentrations, polymer types, and physical properties of MPs in human thrombi surgically retrieved from both arterial and venous systems at three anatomically distinct sites, namely, cerebral arteries in the brain, coronary arteries in the heart, and deep veins in the lower extremities. Furthermore, this study aimed to investigate the potential association between the levels of MPs and disease severity. Methods: Thrombus samples were collected from 30 patients who underwent thrombectomy procedures due to ischaemic stroke (IS), myocardial infarction (MI), or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pyrolysis–gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was employed to identify and quantify the mass concentrations of the MPs. Laser direct infrared (LDIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyse the physical properties of the MPs. Demographic and clinical information were also examined. A rigorous quality control system was used to eliminate potential environmental contamination. Findings: MPs were detected by Py-GC/MS in 80% (24/30) of the thrombi obtained from patients with IS, MI, or DVT, with median concentrations of 61.75 μg/g, 141.80 μg/g, and 69.62 μg/g, respectively. Among the 10 target types of MP polymers, polyamide 66 (PA66), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene (PE) were identified. Further analyses suggested that higher concentrations of MPs may be associated with greater disease severity (adjusted β = 7.72, 95% CI: 2.01–13.43, p < 0.05). The level of D-dimer in the MP-detected group was significantly higher than that in the MP-undetected group (8.3 ± 1.5 μg/L vs 6.6 ± 0.5 μg/L, p < 0.001). Additionally, LDIR analysis showed that PE was dominant among the 15 types of identified MPs, accounting for 53.6% of all MPs, with a mean diameter of 35.6 μm. The shapes of the polymers detected using LDIR and SEM were found to be heterogeneous. Interpretation: This study presents both qualitative and quantitative evidence of the presence of MPs, and their mass concentrations, polymer types, and physical properties in thrombotic diseases through the use of multimodal detection methods. Higher concentrations of MPs may be associated with increased disease severity. Future research with a larger sample size is urgently needed to identify the sources of exposure and validate the observed trends in the study.

       " As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs) cause widespread concern around the world owing to the serious threat they pose to ecosystems. In particular, sediments are thought to be the long-term sink for the continual accumulation of MPs in freshwater ecosystems. Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have been frequently detected with large concentration variations in freshwater sediments from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, one of the most economically developed regions in China, characterized by accelerated urbanization and industrialization, high population density and high plastics consumption. However, the impact of PE and PET on the sedimental bacterial community composition and its function has not been well reported for this specific region. Herein, PE and PET particles were added to freshwater sediments to assess the effects of different MP types on the bacterial community and its function, using three concentrations (500, 1500 and 2500 items/kg) per MP and incubations of 35, 105 and 175 days, respectively. This study identified a total of 68 phyla, 211 classes, 518 orders, 853 families and 1745 genera. Specifically, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota and Firmicutes were the top five phyla. A higher bacterial diversity was obtained in control sediments than in the MP-treated sediments. The presence of MPs, whether PET or PE, had significant impact on the bacterial diversity, community structure and community composition. PICRUSt2 and FAPOTAX predictions demonstrated that MPs could potentially affect the metabolic pathways and ecologically functional groups of bacteria in the sediment. Besides the MP-related factors, such as the type, concentration and incubation time, the physicochemical parameters had an effect on the structure and function of the bacterial community in the freshwater sediment. Taken together, this study provides useful information for further understanding how MPs affect bacterial communities in the freshwater sediment of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution poses global and societal concerns, especially from discarded fishing gear, threatening seabed environments like coral reefs. This study examines the incorporation of lost and/or abandoned fishing gear - specifically synthetic lines, and filaments - into the structure of orange tree coral, Dendrophyllia ramea along the coast of Portugal, in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. The specimens were inadvertently captured by local fishers (Sines and Cascais), with 6 % showing filaments inside their structure, raising questions about their potential impact on coral health. We discuss the implications of understanding the interactions between plastics, fishing gear, and corals, which is important for developing conservation strategies. We address the need for improved of measures aimed at reducing the impact of fishing gear on corals, emphasizing the importance of endorsing biodegradable fishing materials and supporting lost gear retrieval initiatives. Furthermore, we emphasize the urgent need to communicate these issues to both fishers and stakeholders. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are of great concern to coral health, particularly enhanced biotoxicity of small microplastics (< 100 µm) (SMPs). However, their fate and harm to remote coral reef ecosystems remain poorly elucidated. This work systematically investigated the distributions and features of MPs and SMPs in sediments from 13 islands/reefs of the Xisha Islands, the South China Sea for comprehensively deciphering their accumulation, sources and risk to coral reef ecosystems. The results show that both MPs (average, 682 items/kg) and SMPs (average, 375 items/kg) exhibit heterogeneous distributions, with accumulation within atolls and dispersion across fringing islands, which controlled by human activities and hydrodynamic conditions. Cluster analysis for the first time reveals a pronounced difference in their compositions between the southern and northern Xisha Islands and resultant distinct sources, i.e., MPs in the north part were leaked mainly from local domestic sewage and fishing waste, while in the south part were probably derived from industrial effluents from adjacent countries. Our ecological risk assessment suggests that the ecosystem within the Yongle Atoll is exposed to a high-risk of MPs pollution. The novel results and proposed framework facilitate to effectively manage and control MPs and accordingly preserve a fragile biosphere in remote coral reefs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " In the present study, the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in the gut, gill, and muscle of edible fish Stolephorus indicus sampled from Tuticorin coastal regions of Tamilnadu, India was investigated. We recorded a total of 689 MPs which includes 510 and 179 MPs from males and females respectively. The total abundance of MPs was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the gut followed by gills and muscle. The sex-wise distribution of average MPs showed high in the females' gut and compared to that in males. Further, the length wise distribution of MPs was higher in the muscle in both male and female fish, followed by other organs. The predominance of MPs in tissues were transparent and blue colour with fibers and fragments in both males and females. Besides, polyethylene terephthalate and nylon were evidenced by the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum in all organs of fishes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Unmanaged plastic debris from both terrestrial and aquatic sources is causing havoc on Indian coastlines. Tajpur Beach and Haliday Island were selected as two distinct coastal ecosystems in West Bengal for inventorying sighted macro-plastics, aiming to assess their distribution and compare pollution levels. This study employs a comprehensive methodological approach, integrating field-based observations along with lab-based measurements, and information derived from geospatial analysis. Total 34 random points across two study sites were considered for the physical, chemical, and biological characterization of macro-plastics to assess their relative abundance. Areas with higher human footfalls exhibited greater accumulation of plastic debris, with polypropylene, either alone or in combination with polyurethane and polystyrene, identified as highly toxic. Fragmented plastic debris was prevalent at both test sites, yet undisturbed Haliday Island exhibited an abundance of less fragmented materials. Emphasis was also given on implementing appropriate management regimes to achieve plastic-free diverse coastal landscapes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are now ubiquitous environmental contaminants that lead to unavoidable human exposure; they have received increasing attention in recent years and have become an emerging area of research. The greatest concern is the negative impacts of MPs on marine, fresh-water, and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as human health, to the extent that the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for increased research and standardized methods to assess exposure to MPs. Many countries and international organizations are implementing or proposing legislation in this regard. This review aims to summarize the current state of legislation, indoor and outdoor contamination, and potential human health risk due to exposure to airborne MPs, considering that occupational exposure to MPs is also becoming a growing area of concern. Even though research regarding MPs has continuously increased in the last twenty years, the effects of MPs on human health have been scarcely investigated, and toxicity studies are still limited and not directly comparable, due to the lack of standardized studies in this field. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Millions of tons of solid waste, mostly plastics, are annually dumped into the oceans, posing a major 21st-century environmental threat. Commercial shipping and ocean gyres exacerbate pollution on remote islands, resulting in the widespread presence of microplastics throughout the marine environment. Most of this pollution is plastics, and its fragmentation originates from microplastics (particles smaller than 5 mm). These debris are ubiquitous throughout the marine environment, dispersed among beaches, estuaries, on the water surface, and even on the seafloor. This study was carried out on São Miguel Island, Azores, where sediment samples were collected and analysed for microplastic (MP) abundance and dimension across eight areas covering the entire coastline of the island. Each area was divided into four sites along an inland–coastal gradient, from the stream to the ocean (upstream, downstream, coastal, and submerged marine sediments), following a nested design approach. In addition to this first method, 15 beaches, spread along the island’s shore, were also tested and compared. Fibres were the most common type of microplastic, with varying levels of abundance across different locations. Abundance generally increased closer to the coast, but there were occasional instances of high upstream concentrations due to heavy rains, which then accumulated near coastlines and beaches. This study revealed an important local MP source from an apparently pristine touristic region which, aligned with other recent findings, unveils an important and silent pollution issue potentially affecting oceanic islands that should be seriously addressed in future studies and raise concern for litter management and mitigation and environmental awareness actions. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " One significant “sink” for microplastic (MP) pollution is the sediments. There's a considerable lack of reliable data regarding the historical status of MPs contamination in sediments within marine ranching. In this research, the study area encompassed Haizhou bay marine ranching and adjacent seas. The primary objective was to explore the potential relationships between the accumulation of MPs and both the sample depth and sediment characteristics within the cores. The results unveiled significant contamination of MPs within the sediment cores. The average MPs concentration of sediment was 1.01 ± 1.28 n/g. Fibrous polymers and particles smaller than 1000 μm were frequently found in the sediment. The abundance of MPs exhibited a tendency to decrease with an increase in sediment depth. Artificial reefs and currents affected on MPs distribution in sediment cores. The accumulation of MPs showed a significant correlation (P < 0.05) with the sediment content of different particle sizes, suggesting that the composition of sediment can serve as an indicator of the abundance of MPs. The risk of MP pollution in the sediments of the study area was assessed by establishing a risk assessment model using concentration data of MPs and polymer types. Due to the higher hazard score of polymers (PA and PET) in MPs, the Polymer hazard index (PHI) was elevated to grade II. However, it had a Pollution load index (PLIzone) value of 1.95 (level I). This suggested that contamination was minimal, yet the ecological risk remained relatively high. The ecological risk assessment of MPs served as the foundation for gaining a detailed understanding of the distribution characteristics of MPs. It also furnished essential data support for conducting a comprehensive assessment, developing feasible management strategies, and establishing water quality standards related to plastic waste. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " With a phenomenal amount of marine debris being retrieved from the coast and sea, an initiative to engage in marine debris recycling, particularly of plastic debris, has been on the governmental agenda in Taiwan in recent years. Consumers purchasing products made from marine debris is a critical driver behind this initiative. It is therefore important to understand the factors influencing consumers’ purchase intentions towards these products. By employing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this paper aims to decode the factors and thereby infer potential measures to enhance consumers’ purchase intentions for these specific products in Taiwan, where recycling marine debris is at the beginning stage. By conducting a questionnaire survey, the study collected a total of 392 valid samples and found that a high percentage of respondents had not heard of marine debris labels as well as having never bought products made from marine debris. In addition, by testing the hypotheses using binary logit regression, the study found that ‘environmental attitude’, ‘perceived price’, ‘availability’, and ‘marine debris label’ were the major factors that significantly influenced consumers’ intentions to purchase these products. With a view to increasing market penetration of these products, this paper highlights the need to strengthen environmental education, subsidize manufacturers in the production of products, promote labels and enhance product availability, and enhance public participation in marine conservation activities. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Coastal beaches are vulnerable to microplastic pollution originating primarily from terrestrial and marine sources or the in situ weathering of plastic waste. The present study investigates the effects of rainfall events on the composition and diversity of microplastics on beaches in Xiamen City on a short-term scale. In the results, the quantity of microplastics in beach sediments was 245.83 ± 11.61 items·kg−1 (mean ± standard error). The abundance of microplastics did not differ after each rainfall event but significantly decreased after multiple rainfall events. When the diversity of microplastics in the coastal area was evaluated, the Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou’s index also decreased from 3.12 and 0.64 to 2.99 and 0.62, respectively, after multiple rainfall events. Rainfall had varying effects on microplastics depending on their size and shape, with particles smaller than 500 μm experiencing pronounced reductions. There was a significant negative correlation between the abundance of microplastics and the grain size of sand, but a positive correlation with sediment moisture content. We encourage the consideration of the potential impact of rainfall events during sample collection to ensure the reliability of the data. We also recommend using diversity indexes to help in understanding the influence of physical processes on microplastic distribution and their mechanisms. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) both represent significant concerns in environmental sciences. This paper aims to develop a convenient and efficient methodology for the detection and measurement of MPs and nanoparticles from surface seawater and to apply it to the water samples collected from the UNESCO site of Venice and its lagoon, more precisely in the Venice-Lido Port Inlet, Grand Canal under Rialto Bridge, and Saint Marc basin. In this study, MPs were analyzed through optical microscopy for their relative abundance and characterized based on their color, shape, and size classes, while the concentration and the mean of nanoparticles were estimated via the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis technique. Bulk seawater sampling, combined with filtration through a cascade of stainless-steel sieves and subsequent digestion, facilitates the detection of MPs of relatively small sizes (size classes distribution: >1 mm, 1000–250 μm, 250–125 μm, 125–90 μm, and 90–32 μm), similar to the size of MPs ingested by marine invertebrates and fishes. A protocol for minimizing interference from non-plastic nanoparticles through evaporation, digestion, and filtration processes was proposed to enrich the sample for NPs. The findings contribute to the understanding of the extent and characteristics of MPs and nanoparticle pollution in the Venice Lagoon seawater, highlighting the potential environmental risks associated with these pollutants and the need for coordinated approaches to mitigate them.

       " The global ocean, the largest single ecosystem in the world, is in continuous decline due to increasing human pressures. New challenges, such as ocean warming and deoxygenation, ocean acidification, plastic pollution, and unsustainable use of marine resources, have no borders and boundaries. However, the recently adopted 2023 BBNJ Agreement does not recognise the high seas decline as a common concern of humankind - a legal notion/concept and treaty-based principle for internationally shared problems such as biodiversity loss and climate change. This article attempts to define the common concern of humankind by examining its legal basis, enshrinement and effect, as it still lacks a generally accepted legal definition. This article aims to propose why the high seas decline should be recognised as a common concern of humankind and to explore the underlying legal and regulatory implications of this notion for the conservation of the high seas.

       " Plastic pollution is an ever-increasing threat globally and poor waste management in South Africa has caused an increase in plastic leakage into the environment. Plastic waste in the environment are categorized according to size and plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in size are regarded as microplastics (MPs), and little to no research has been done on MPs pollution within the marine coastal environment and rocky shores in South Africa. Sampling was done in February 2020 at a rocky shore within Simon's Town Marina, Cape Town. MPs were extracted from collected water (n = 5), sediment (n = 5) and biota (n ≤ 30) samples. The extracted MPs were further classified based on shape, colour, size and an attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) instrument was utilized for polymer type identification The risks posed by MPs because of concentration at which they occurred and chemical composition were assessed in all the sample types. As expected, MPs were higher in sediment (38 ± 2 MP/kg) than in water (0.37 ± 0.06 MP/L) as the area has low water energy, allowing MP particles to settle within the sediment. Filter-feeding organisms had the lowest average MP particle concentrations (0.28 ± 0.04 MP/g) but displayed the highest variation of MP particle colours due to the non-selective feeding strategy, where other feeding strategies ingested mostly black/grey particles. The dominant MP size was between 100 μm and 500 μm in size for all samples combined, with the most abundant MP polymer type being nylon (27.27 %), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (18.18 %) and natural MP particles such as cotton (18.18 %). The risk assessment indicated that polymer type poses a greater risk of MP pollution than MP concentrations. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have been suspected as contaminants in various foodstuffs, including salts, all over the world. Regarding the different sizes and polymer types, the mass concentrations of actual plastic particles in salt are not very clear. The purpose of this study is to develop a scalable method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of MPs and NPs by using Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Quadrupole-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (Py-GC/QTOFMS) to detect their mass concentrations in salt samples. The targeted and suspected lists of polymers in salts were compiled based on the combined results of the high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) full scanning with auxiliary MS dataset and the laser direct infrared (LDIR) chemical imaging analysis. The seven targeted MPs with polymer standards, i.e., polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polycarbonate (PC), were first subjected to a full MS scanning mode of the Py-GC/QTOFMS analysis. Subsequently, the parental masses of their pyrolysis compounds were used as the seeds to generate the related daughter masses. This process established both retention time and mass-pairs matching for the target MS/MS mode for enabling the identification and quantification of the particles. The suspected MPs with a matching degree >0.65 in the LDIR list were explored either by the full scan MS. Only PVC was identified, and PET was suspected. The Py-GC/QTOFMS result is complementary and comparable to the LDIR detection with the matching degree >0.85. We identified that PVC and PET (suspected) can be measured in both commercial and bulk sea salts, and their concentrations in sea salts are much higher than in rock salts, implying heavy contamination of the seawater. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Introduction: The presence of microplastics in the environment increases the diversity of types of pollutants in waters, including clean water sources on the surface and underground. Karst areas have unique hydrological characteristics, with cracks and fissures between the rocks that can be potential routes for the transport and accumulation of microplastics in underground river flows. In this study, we want to know the distribution and abundance of microplastics in underground rivers in the karst area of South Malang, Indonesia. Methods: Samples were collected purposively from underground river of Lowo, Banyu and Sengik. Microplastics were prepared using a diluted solvent of 30% H2 SO4 and 30% H2 O2. The sediment sample was dried and then filtered twice using 300-mesh size nylon filters until microplastic particles accumulated. Results and Discussion: Microplastics were detected in all water samples, with an average abundance ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 particles per liter. Fibers were the dominant microplastic type, followed by fragments and films, while the color distribution includes blue, white, red, yellow, black, green, pink, and brown. Conclusion: Microplastic contamination has been found in underground river flows in the karst area of South Malang, Indonesia. Karst soil, traditionally viewed as a natural filter, is not impervious to plastic pollution. This suggests significantly higher surface contamination than previously assumed. Therefore, reducing surface pollution is essential to safeguard the precious quality of underground aquifers and protect public health above. © 2024 Jurnal Kesehatan Lingkungan all right reserved.,\n",
       " Southeast Asian countries are recognized as significant contributors to the discharge of abundant plastic waste into the ocean. In this study, we conducted neuston net surveys on Si Chang Island of the Gulf of Thailand, a coral reef conservation area, to determine the presence of microplastic (MP) pollution. The survey, conducted during the wet (southwesterly monsoon), transition, and dry seasons (northeasterly monsoon), revealed that the MP abundance was in the range of 0.02–42.46 particles m−3. The precipitation, wind, and current direction induced by monsoons influenced the abundance and distribution of MP, presenting a significant seasonality. The cluster analysis for colors and polymer types of MPs suggested that the origin of plastic particles is diverse. Based on our results, a proposal for the generation, sources, and pathways for MPs in the Gulf of Thailand is presented: 1) plastic wastes exposed to strong UV light during the dry season get fragmented around the river, and 2) heavy rains wash away the particles during the wet season. This proposal is applicable to tropical regions, including the Gulf of Thailand. Therefore, this paper concluded that ocean currents induced by monsoons and the unique climate, resulting in the generation of MPs on land, increase MP presence and distribution in the ocean surrounding Southeast Asia countries. Furthermore, coral reef ecosystems can be particularly threatened by MPs in these areas. So, an increase in MP monitoring on coral ecosystems from Thailand and the world is highly recommended. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Marine microdebris (MDs, <5 mm) and mesodebris (MesDs, 5–25 mm), consist of various components, including microplastics (MPs), antifouling or anticorrosive paint particles (APPs), and metallic particles (Mmps), among others. The accumulation of these anthropogenic particles in macroalgae could have significant implications within coastal ecosystems because of the role of macroalgae as primary producers and their subsequent transfer within the trophic chain. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the abundance of MDs and MesDs pollution in different species of macroalgae (P. morrowii, C. rubrum, Ulva spp., and B. minima) and in surface waters from the Southwest Atlantic coast of Argentina to evaluate the ecological damage. MDs and MesDs were chemically characterized using μ-FTIR and SEM/EDX to identify, and assess their environmental impact based on their composition and degree of pollution by MPs, calculating the Polymer Hazard Index (PHI). The prevalence of MDs was higher in foliose species, followed by filamentous and tubular ones, ranging from 0 to 1.22 items/g w.w. for MPs and 0 to 0.85 items/g w.w. for APPs. It was found that macroalgae accumulate a higher proportion of high-density polymers like PAN and PES, as well as APPs based on alkyd, PMMA, and PE resins, whereas a predominance of CE was observed in surrounding waters. Potentially toxic elements, such as Cr, Cu, and Ti, were detected in APPs and MPs, along with the presence of epiplastic communities on the surface of APPs. According to PHI, the presence of high hazard score polymers, such as PAN and PA, increased the overall risk of MP pollution in macroalgae compared to surrounding waters. This study provided a baseline for MDs and MesDs abundance in macroalgae as well as understanding the environmental impact of this debris and their bioaccumulation in the primary link of the coastal trophic chain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " UV degradation of marine microplastics (MPs) could increase their vector potential for pathogenic bacteria and threaten human health. However, little is known about how the degree of UV aging affects interactions between MPs and pathogens and how various types of MPs differ in their impact on seafood safety. This study investigated five types of UV-aged MPs and their impact on Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a seafood pathogen. MPs exposed to UV for 60 days showed similar physicochemical changes such as surface cracking and hydrophobicity reduction. Regardless of the type, longer UV exposure of MPs resulted in more biofilm formation on the surface under the same conditions. V. parahaemolyticus types that formed biofilms on the MP surface showed 1.4- to 5.0-fold upregulation of virulence-related genes compared to those that did not form biofilms, independently of UV exposure. However, longer UV exposure increased resistance of V. parahaemolyticus on MPs to chlorine, heat, and human gastrointestinal environment. This study implies that the more UV degradation occurs on MPs, the more microbial biofilm formation is induced, which can significantly increase virulence and environmental resistance of bacteria regardless of the type of MP. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The amount of information available on the microplastic (MP) contamination in Goa’s riverine water systems is currently limited. The abundance, size, colour, and polymer composition of microplastics in Chapora River surface water were investigated in this study. MPs in Chapora River surface water ranged from 0.1 particles/L (station 13) to 0.47 particles/L (station 5). The mean (± standard deviation) MP concentration was 0.25 (± 0.13) particles/L. Fibre was the dominant shape (77.15%), followed by fragments (12.36%), films (9.36%), and foam (1.12%). Most MPs were found in the 0.1–0.3 mm size range, then in the 0.3–1 mm and 1–5 mm. The dominant type of polymer studied was polyethylene terephthalate (PET; 46%), followed by high-density polyethylene (HDPE; 14%), polypropylene (PP; 5%), and polystyrene (PS; 1%). The risk assessment study indicated high risk with respect to PHI, while PLI shows low risk in the area. The source of MPs was mostly anthropogenic in nature in the region. When compared with other tropical rivers, MP pollution was relatively lower in the Chapora River. Nevertheless, the baseline data will help the local administration take mitigation measures to reduce the impact of MP pollution in the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " In the aquatic environment, microplastic particles (MP) can accumulate in microbial communities that cover submerged substrata, i.e. in periphyton. Despite periphyton being the essential food source for grazers in the benthic zones, MP transfer from periphyton to benthic biota and its ecotoxicological consequences are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of 1) MP on embryonal development of freshwater gastropod Physa acuta embryos, 2) MP on adult Physa acuta individuals through dietary exposure and 3) on the MP surface properties. Embryonal development tests were carried out with spherical polyethylene MP in the size of 1–4 μm (MP). Over a period of 28 days, embryonal development and hatching rate were calculated. In the feeding experiments, periphyton was grown in the presence and absence of MP and was then offered to the adult Physa acuta for 42–152 h. The snails readily ingested and subsequently egested MP, together with the periphyton as shown by MP quantification in periphyton, snail soft body tissue and feces. No selective feeding behavior upon MP exposure was detected. The ingestion of MP had no effect on mortality, feeding and defecation rate. Yet, the reproductive output of snails, measured as the number of egg clutches and numbers of eggs per clutch, decreased after the ingestion of MPs, while the hatching success of snail embryos those parents were exposed remained unaffected. In contrast, hatching rate of snail embryos was significantly reduced upon direct MP exposure. MP optical properties were changed upon the incorporation into the periphyton and the passage through the digestive tract. Our results indicate that MP incorporated in periphyton are bioavailable to aquatic grazers, facilitating the introduction of MP into the food chain and having direct adverse effects on the grazers’ reproductive fitness. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic identification and distribution throughout oceans has become a great concern due to its substantial uprising and its consequent interactions with marine biota. Microplastics can be absorbed and adsorbed by several marine species owing to their very small size. Among these organisms are bivalves, including ones used as food for humans. In this context, this research aims to understand the absorption scale of microplastics by Tivela mactroides according to their size and consequently life stage. Thus, T. mactroides mussels were collected at Camburi Beach (Brazil) and grouped into 30 different size classes from 06 to 35 mm. Later, 20 specimens from each size class (N = 600) had the soft tissues removed and a pool was performed through digestion with 10 % KOH solution. Results showed the presence of microplastics in all size classes of T. mactroides, evidencing that organisms from 06 mm can already be contaminated by microplastics and a tendency of the number of microplastics particles to increase as shell size increases. Furthermore, the amount of blue filament-type MPs was significantly higher than the other types and colors. Additionally, analyzes performed by Raman spectroscopy showed that the blue filaments have a PET composition. Finally, larger individuals presented larger quantities of MPs, as well as larger filaments. This might suggest that there are differences between the assimilation of the size of MPs in the different size classes, i.e. that size makes a difference. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a growing global concern due to its potential threat to human health, particularly concerning fetal health. Nevertheless, few studies have examined the sources of fetal MPs exposure and its impact on fetal development. In this study, MPs levels in maternal amniotic fluid (AF) and their associations with measures of fetal growth were investigated. Specifically, 40 human AF samples were collected to determine the presence and characteristics of MPs using laser direct infrared (LD-IR) spectroscopy. MPs were found in 32 out of 40 AF samples, with an average abundance of 2.01 ± 4.19 particles/g. Polyethylene (PE, 38.80 %) and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE, 26.98 %) were the most prevalent polymers. The majority of MPs (87.56 %) were 20–100 μm in size, and fragments (71.23 %) evidently prevailed in morphology. Additionally, a questionnaire was designed to explore the associations between MPs levels in the AF and maternal dietary habits, aiming at unveiling the potential sources of MPs in AF. The MPs levels in the AF were positively associated with the frequency of seafood consumption (r = 0.781, P < 0.001) and bottled water intake (r = 0.386, P = 0.014). Moreover, the associations between MPs levels in maternal AF and measures of fetal growth were evaluated. The abundance of total MPs in maternal AF were significantly negatively associated with gestational age (β = −0.44, 95 % CI, −0.83, −0.05). This study confirms the presence of MPs in human AF and provides compelling evidence linking them to gestational age, while highlighting the potential risks associated with dietary habits. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of MPs transmission from mother to fetus and the potential health implications during fetal development, offering valuable insights for future policies aimed at safeguarding maternal and fetal health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), a newly emerging class of environmental contaminants, pose a severe threat to the entire ecosystem. The development of efficient and environmentally responsible adsorbents for removing the MPs is a particularly urgent research. Herein, a kind of monolithic ZIF-8 based adsorbents featuring stable hydrophobicity and micropore-mesopore-macropore hierarchical porous structure were fabricated by in situ growth of ZIF-8 nanoparticles on sodium alginate (SA) framework, and using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a hydrophobic agent. The monolithic nature of ZIF-8/SA allowed an easy solid–liquid separation process for adsorbents from water environment compared to powdered materials. The hierarchical porous structure ensures a remarkable MPs removal performance. The ZIF-8/SA showed high adsorption capacities of 594, 585, and 282 mg/g for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), poly (vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) respectively, and rapid adsorption kinetic progress within 120 min. The ZIF-8/SA adsorbents also exhibited excellent stability in the presence of interfering ions, acid/alkali, and humic acid, and displayed adsorption performance of > 70 % even in actual aquatic environment such as tap water, river water, and seawater. The results of characterizations showed that the synergistic effect of electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic force, and van der Waals force was the main adsorption mechanism. The well-designed hydrophobic ZIF-8/SA monolithic materials would be promising to rapidly remove the MPs from the water environment. © 2024,\n",
       " As plastic pollution continues to accumulate at the seafloor, concerns around benthic ecosystem functionality heightens. This research demonstrates the systematic effects of polyester microfibers on seafloor organic matter consumption rates, an important benthic ecosystem function connected to multiple reactions and processes. We used a field-based assay to measure the loss of organic matter, both with and without polyester microfiber contamination. We identified sediment organic matter content, mud content, and mean grain size as the main drivers of organic matter consumption, however, polyester microfiber contamination decoupled ecosystem relationships and altered observed organic matter cycling dynamics. Organic matter consumption rates varied across horizontal and vertical spaces, highlighting that consumption and associated plastic effects are dependent on environmental heterogeneity at both small (within sites) and larger (between sites) scales. Our results emphasize the important role habitat heterogeneity plays in seafloor organic matter consumption and the associated effects of plastic pollution on ecosystem function. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Alternative and substitute materials to conventional plastic packaging offer a range of potential opportunities to help reduce the environmental impacts of single-use plastic. Policymakers and industry stakeholders are currently debating measures to address the plastic pollution crisis globally, but successful implementation of new policies or packaging technologies will require understanding of consumer perspectives and consumer acceptability. The present study aimed to examine consumer perceptions around plastic alternatives and substitutes by employing a life cycle approach. The Kano model of consumer satisfaction was used to investigate how UK consumers (n = 1177) responded to a variety of environmentally relevant attributes and end-of-life scenarios for different types of packaging (conventional plastic, biodegradable plastic, and glass). These responses were further grouped based on sociodemographic characteristics of the consumers including age, gender and level of education, as well as psycho-environmental variables such as nature connectedness. We show that consumers valued recyclability or compostability of packaging as preferable end-of-life attributes, and that overall consumers considered the release of plastic packaging into the natural environment an unacceptable end-of-life scenario. Concerningly, this was not the case for packaging made of biodegradable plastic or glass, highlighting the potential for alternatives and substitutes to increase the proportion of mismanaged waste. All four consumer groups had distinct profiles of responses to packaging sustainability attributes and end-of-life scenarios: ‘Educated environmentalists’, consisting mostly of female consumers, considered all of the attributes of interest to be important, whereas ‘Older, less educated coastal dwellers’ showed similar responses but rated four out of seven sustainability attributes of biodegradable plastic packaging as irrelevant. ‘Non-environmentalists’ perceived all attributes as irrelevant, as did ‘Nature-connected egocentrists’, with the exception of glass being made of recycled material. Overall, our findings indicate that consumers are not sufficiently informed about the environmental impacts and opportunities around packaging, highlighting the need for appropriate consumer education to support policy and industry in implementing the UN Plastics Treaty. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The quantification of microplastic (MP) pollution in rivers is often constrained by a lack of historical data on a multi-decadal scale, which hinders the evaluation of public policies. In this study, MP contents and trends were analyzed in dated sediment cores sampled upstream and downstream of a large metropolis, in environmental deposits that exhibited consistent sedimentation patterns from the 1980s to 2021. After a thorough sedimentological analysis, MPs were quantified in samples by micro Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (μFTIR imaging) and a density separation and organic matter digestion procedure. Microplastics recorded in the upstream core are relatively ubiquitous all along the dated sequence. The results also confirmed a sever increase of microplastics levels in the downstream core, by one order of magnitude, and an increase of polymer types. Polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene represent ubiquitous contamination and were predominant at the two stations, whereas polyvinyl chloride and polytetrafluoroethylene were suspected to be abundant at the downstream station, but were not detected at the upstream station. Their presence could be linked to local contamination from specific industrial sources that manufactured and utilized these polymers. Surprisingly, in the downstream station sediment has recorded a relative improvement in polymers associated with industrial sources since the 2000s and, to a lesser extent, for ubiquitous ones since the 2010s. This trend of mitigation diverges from that of global assessments, that assume uncontrolled MP pollution, and suggest that European Union wastewater policy and regulation on industrial discharges have positively influenced water quality, and certainly also on MPs. However, the accumulation of microplastics remains high in recent deposits and raises the emerging concern of the long-term management of these reservoirs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The preservation of marine fisheries resources within ASEAN nations’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an urgent and pressing challenge requiring collaborative efforts from all ASEAN nations. Challenges such as illegal fishing, climate change, and lack of coordination between ASEAN nations may cause damage to marine biota food chain, especially marine fisheries in Southeast Asia region. To solve this conundrum, collaboration between ASEAN nations pose as the key solution. The research method used in this study is normative juridical approach by analyzing primary legal materials such as International Agreements and other international laws & sources. Further analysis was also conducted from secondary law materials such as international journals and books. It should be noted that the preservation of marine fisheries within ASEAN region has always been a topic that needs to be continuously improved. The urgency to escalate the preservation efforts can be seen in various programs conducted through Ministerial Understanding on Fisheries Cooperation in 1983, as a form of understanding and cooperation between ASEAN nations for the development, management, and conservation of marine fisheries resources within ASEAN EEZ region. Moreover, ASEAN also carried out collaborative efforts for marine fisheries conservation through ASEAN Policy of the General Fisheries Policy Feasibility Study (AGFP). AGFP regulate the ASEAN marine fisheries sector and encompassed 15 focus areas, including marine fisheries resources management, countermeasures against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing, research on marine fisheries, food security, international trade, animal health, conservation of habitat, and management of marine debris and garbage. The policy was ultimately established by the ASEAN nations member as a Working Unit Forum named The ASEAN Sectoral Working Group on Fisheries (ASWGFi) to realize the vision and mission of AGFP. Efforts to overcome this challenge are laid out by committing to preserve marine fisheries resources in ASEAN nation’s regions, focusing on protecting marine biodiversity – especially marine fisheries resources, encouraging economic and social sustainability, while ensuring food availability and security for the future. © 2024, University of Indonesia Faculty of Law.

       " The accumulation of human-derived waste on our coasts is an escalating phenomenon, yet the relative importance and potential interactions among its main drivers are not fully understood. We used citizen-science standardized collections to investigate how anthropogenic and environmental factors influence the level, composition, and temporal variation of beach debris. An average of 58 kg and 803 items/100 m, dominated by single-use items of land (rather than sea) origin, were collected in the 881 beaches sampled. Interactions between anthropogenic and environmental factors (e.g., human use × beach substrate) were the strongest predictors of beach debris, accounting for 34% of the variance explained in its amount and composition. Beach debris showed a highly stochastic temporal variation (adjusted R2 = 0.05), partly determined by interactions between different local and landscape anthropogenic pressures. Our results show that both environmental and anthropogenic factors (at the local and landscape scale) co-determine the level and composition of beach debris. We emphasize the potential of citizen-science to inform environmental policy, showing that land-originated single-use items dominate beach debris, and the importance of considering their multiple anthropogenic and environmental drivers to improve our low predictive power regarding their spatio-temporal distribution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Temperature changes due to climate change and microplastic contamination are worldwide concerns, creating various problems in the marine environment. Therefore, this study was carried out to discover the impact of different temperatures of seawater exposed to different types of plastic materials on culture dependent bacterial responses and oxidative characteristics. Seawater was exposed to microplastics obtained from various plastic materials at different temperature (−18, +4, +20, and +35 °C) for seven days. Then microplastics were removed from the suspension and microplastic-exposed seawater samples were analyzed for bacterial activity, biofilm formation and oxidative characteristics (antioxidant, catalase, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase) using Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The results showed that the activity and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were affected through oxidative stress by catalase, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase due to the microplastic deformation by temperature changes. This study confirms that temperature changes as a result of climate change might influence microplastic degradation and their contamination impact in seawater in terms of bacterial metabolic and oxidation reactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Abstract: The results of a quantitative assessment of the content of microplastics (MPs) in Siberian wood frog (Rana amurensis) larvae and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of adults from the floodplain of the Goloustnaya River flowing into Baikal Lake are presented. MP particles are found in the GITs of 83% (n = 18) of Siberian wood frogs aged 1+ to 4+. In the GITs of R. amurensis adults, MP particles are represented by microfibers (84.6%), microspheres (6.2%), microfilms (6.2%), and irregularly shaped fragments (3.0%). The sizes of MPs range from 0.3 to 5 mm. The average number of particles in frog GITs is 3.5 ± 3.6 per individual, with a spread from 0 to 11.6 particles. No significant correlations are found between the level of MP accumulation and the age of individuals of different sexes. No MPs are found in R. amurensis larvae (n = 120), which is largely due to the low productivity of temporary shallow breeding water bodies in the floodplain of the Goloustnaya River, which are experiencing powerful anthropogenic pressure (transport, grazing, and hay harvesting). The detection of MPs in the GITs of adult Siberian wood frogs indirectly indicates the contamination of the valley and the mouth of the Goloustnaya River, including the coast of Lake Baikal. The data obtained in this study are the first evidence of the presence of MPs in amphibians in the Russian Federation. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

       " Microplastic pollution is a global issue of great public concern. Africa is flagged to host some of the most polluted water bodies globally, but there is no enough information on the extent of microplastic contamination and the potential risks of microplastic pollution in African aquatic ecosystems. This meta-analysis has integrated data from published articles about microplastic pollution in African aquatic ecosystems. The data on the microplastic distribution and morphological characteristics in water, sediments and biota from African rivers, lakes, oceans and seas were extracted from 75 selected studies. Multivariate statistics were used to critically analyze the effects of sampling and detection methods, ecological risks, spatial distribution and similarity of microplastics in relation to the geographical distance between sampling sites. This study found that sampling methods have significant effect on abundance and morphological characteristics of microplastics and that African aquatic ecosystems are highly contaminated with microplastics compared to global data. The most prevalent colors were white, transparent and black, the most prevalent shapes were fibres and fragments, and the most available polymers were polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethene terephthalate (PET). Microplastic polymers similarity decreased with an increase in geographical distance between sites. Risk levels of microplastics in African aquatic ecosystems were comparatively high, and more than 40 % of water and sediments showed highest level of ecological risk. This review provides recent information on the prevalence, distribution and risks of microplastics in African aquatic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " This review comprehensively evaluates the impacts of anthropogenic threats on beaked whales (Ziphiidae)—a taxonomic group characterized by cryptic biology, deep dives and remote offshore habitat, which have challenged direct scientific observation. By synthesizing information published in peer-reviewed studies and grey literature, we identified available evidence of impacts across 14 threats for each Ziphiidae species. Threats were assessed based on their pathways of effects on individuals, revealing many gaps in scientific understanding of the risks faced by beaked whales. By applying a comprehensive taxon-level analysis, we found evidence that all beaked whale species are affected by multiple stressors, with climate change, entanglement and plastic pollution being the most common threats documented across beaked whale species. Threats assessed as having a serious impact on individuals included whaling, military sonar, entanglement, depredation, vessel strikes, plastics and oil spills. This review emphasizes the urgent need for targeted research to address a range of uncertainties, including cumulative and population-level impacts. Understanding the evidence and pathways of the effects of stressors on individuals can support future assessments, guide practical mitigation strategies and advance current understanding of anthropogenic impacts on rare and elusive marine species. © 2024 The Authors.,\n",
       " As an emerging pollutant，microplastics have received increasing concern. Sediment can reflect the long-term pollution level of microplastics because it is recognized as a sink of microplastics. To explore the distribution characteristics of microplastics in sediments of a typical urban river network，sediment samples were collected from 17 sampling sites in December 2018 and June 2019. A stereomicroscope and micro-fourier transform infrared spectrometer were used to observe the morphology and identify the composition of microplastics. The results showed that the mean abundance of microplastics was 323. 37 n·kg-1. The microplastics were predominately black and blue in color，50-500 μm in size，and fragment and fiber in shape，and the composition was mainly PET，PE，PVE，PS，and PP. The abundance of microplastics in summer was lower than that in winter，and the abundance of microplastics in upstream areas was higher than that in middle and downstream areas. It was found that the highest concentration occurred near a wastewater treatment plant，and there was no significant correlation between the abundance of microplastics in sediment and that in surface water. In this study，the PMF model was applied to analyze the sources of microplastic pollution. It was found that the main sources of microplastics were agricultural plastic film，domestic wastewater，plastic waste，and industrial production. Our study provided a scientific basis for the prevention and control of microplastic pollution in a typical urban river network. © 2024 Science Press. All rights reserved.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is a central issue of great concern in the current environmental field. Microplastic pollution in marine environmental media is widely reported，but the characteristics of microplastic pollution in deep sediments are rarely reported. Based on this，three sampling points were set up on the muddy coast near the Haizhou Bay，a typical aquaculture sea area，to analyze the characteristics of microplastic pollution in sediment column samples. The study showed that the abundance of microplastics in the sediments of the study area was（0. 12 ± 0. 07）n·g−1，which was at the medium pollution level. The total amount of microplastics in the sediment column was 3. 43-6. 00 times the abundance of microplastics in the surface sediment（5 cm）. The abundance of microplastics in the sediment column samples showed regional differences. There was no significant difference in the abundance of microplastics in the sediment at different depths，but the index decreased with the increase in depth. The relationship between sediment moisture content，depth，and microplastics indicated that the abundance of microplastics in sediment was related to the physical properties of the sediment. Transparent and black microplastics accounted for the highest proportion in each station. Fiber was the most common form of microplastics in the sediment，and microplastics with small particle size accounted for the majority. The density of microplastics did not prevent its appearance in the sediment. The pollution characteristics of microplastics varied greatly in different depths of sediments. © 2024 Science Press.

       " The mounting issue of plastic waste in the aquatic ecosystem is a growing source of concern. Most plastic waste originates on land and a significant proportion of this eventually finds its way into the marine environment, which is widely regarded as a major repository for plastic debris. Currently, there exists a substantial gap in our understanding of how much plastic, the main polymer types, and the distribution of plastic in the marine environment. This study aimed to provide information on mass concentrations of a range of plastics in the surface sediments in the semi-enclosed Moreton Bay, just offshore the large city of Brisbane, Southeast Queensland, Australia. Surface sediment samples were quantitatively analysed for a suite of 7 common plastic polymer types (i.e., polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) using a pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by double-shot microfurnace pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS). The advantage of this approach is that it can measure plastics below the limit of visual detection. The study revealed that Σ7plastics were consistently present in the samples, although the concentrations displayed a wide range of concentrations from 3.3 to 2194.2 μg/g across different sites. Among the polymers analysed, PE and PVC were found at the highest concentrations, ranging from 2.3 to 1885.9 μg/g and 3.0–979.5 μg/g, respectively. Based on the average concentrations of plastics measured, the dry bulk density and volume of sediments within the top 10 cm of the bay, it was estimated that there is a minimum of 7000 t of plastics stored in the surface sediments of the bay. This study is the first to report the mass concentrations of identified plastics and identify the main polymer types in Moreton Bay. This is important information to develop management plans to reduce the plastic waste entering the coastal marine environment. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on examining the ecotoxicological effects of anthropogenic microparticles (MPs), especially microplastic particles, and related issues. Nevertheless, a notable deficiency exists in our understanding of the consequences on marine organisms, specifically in relation to microfibers and the combined influence of MPs and temperature. In this investigation, mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia), an important species and prey item in estuarine and marine food webs, were subjected to four separate experimental trials involving fibers (cotton, nylon, polyester, hemp; 3 particles/ml; approximately 200 μm in length) or fragments (low-density Polyethylene: LDPE, polylactic acid: PLA, and their leachates; 5, 50, 200, 500 particles/ml; 1–20 μm). To consider the effects in the context of climate change, three different temperatures (22, 25, and 28 °C) were examined. Organismal growth and swimming behavior were measured following exposure to fragments and microfibers, and reactive oxygen species and particle uptake were investigated after microfiber exposure. To simulate the physical characteristics of MP exposure, such as microfibers obstructing the gills, we also assessed the post-fiber-exposure swimming behavior in an oxygen-depleted environment. Data revealed negligible fragment, but fiber exposure effects on growth. PLA leachate triggered higher activity at 25 °C and 28 °C; LDPE exposures led to decreased activity at 28 °C. Cotton exposures led to fewer behavioral differences compared to controls than other fiber types. The exposure to hemp fibers resulted in significant ROS increases at 28 °C. Microfibers were predominantly located within the gastric and upper gastrointestinal tract, suggesting extended periods of residence and the potential for obstructive phenomena over the longer term. The combination of increasing water temperatures, microplastic influx, and oxidative stress has the potential to pose risks to all components of marine and aquatic food webs. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Anthropogenically modified microparticles including microplastics are present in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents; however, it is unclear whether biotic exposures are elevated downstream of these outfalls. In the fall of 2019, the present study examined whether microparticle levels in resident fish, environmental samples, and caged organisms were elevated near the Waterloo and Kitchener WWTP outfalls along the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. Wild rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) were collected from a total of 10 sites upstream and downstream of both WWTPs, along with surface water and sediment samples to assess spatial patterns over an approximately 70-km river stretch. Amphipods (Hyalella azteca), fluted-shell mussels (Lasmigona costata), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were also caged upstream and downstream of one WWTP for 14 or 28 days. Whole amphipods, fish digestive tracts, and mussel tissues (hemolymph, digestive glands, gills) were digested with potassium hydroxide, whereas environmental samples were processed using filtration and density separation. Visual identification, measurement, and chemical confirmation (subset only) of microparticles were completed. Elevated abiotic microparticles were found at several upstream reference sites as well as at one or both wastewater-impacted sites. Microparticles in amphipods, all mussel tissues, and wild fish did not show patterns indicative of increased exposures downstream of effluent discharges. In contrast, elevated microparticle counts were found in trout caged directly downstream of the outfall. Across all samples, cellulose fibers (mainly blue and clear colors) were the most common. Overall, results suggest little influence of WWTP effluents on microparticles in biota but rather a ubiquitous presence across most sites that indicates the importance of other point and nonpoint sources to this system.

       " Microplastics (MPs) present in terrestrial environments show potential leaching risk to deeper soil layers and aquifer systems, which threaten soil health and drinking water supply. However, little is known about the environmental fate of MPs in natural sediments. To examine the MPs transport mechanisms in natural sediments, column experiments were conducted using different natural sediments and MPs (10–150 µm) with conservative tracer. Particle breakthrough curves (BTCs) and retention profiles (RPs) were numerically interpreted in HYDRUS-1D using three different models to identify the most plausible deposition mechanism of MPs. Results show that the retention efficiency for a given particle size increased with decreasing grain size, and RPs exacerbated their hyper-exponential shape in finer sediments. Furthermore, the amounts of MPs present in the effluent increased to over 85 % as MPs size decreased to 10–20 µm in both gravel and coarse sand columns, while all larger MPs (125–150 µm) were retained in the coarse sand column. The modeling results suggested that the blocking mechanism becomes more important with increasing particle sizes. In particular, the attachment-detachment without blocking was the most suited parameterization to interpret the movement of small MPs, while a depth-dependent blocking approach was necessary to adequately describe the fate of larger particles. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Despite the widespread presence of anthropogenic microparticles (AMs) in beach sediments, research on their occurrence on Moroccan Mediterranean beaches is still limited. This study is the first report on AM pollution in four sandy beaches along the Tetouan coast (Morocco Mediterranean). The findings reveal an average AM concentration of 483.12 ± 157.04 AMs/kg of beach sediment. The most common AM types were fibers (75.54%) and fragments (24.06%). AMs were predominantly black, red, and blue, measuring between 0.1 and 1 mm. The evaluation of the anthropogenic microparticles pollution index (AMPI) and the coefficient of anthropogenic microparticles impact (CAMI) for the study area indicated a “very high abundance” of AMs and an “extreme” level of impact. The polymers identified in these areas included PS, PE, PP, and PET. Tourism, fishing, domestic activities, and poor solid waste management practices are the primary sources of AM pollution in this region. To protect Moroccan beaches, the implementation of a consistent plastic waste management strategy is recommended. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Mangrove leaves have been acknowledged as crucial sink for coastal microplastics (MPs). Whereas, the temporal dynamics of MPs intercepted by mangrove leaves have remained poorly understood. Here, we detected MPs intercepted by submerged and non-submerged mangrove leaves over time and the potential driving factors. Abundance and characteristics of MPs interception by mangrove leaves exhibited dynamic fluctuations, with the coefficient of variation (CV) of submerged mangrove leaves (CV = 0.604; 1.76 n/g to 15.45 n/g) being approximately twofold higher than non-submerged mangrove leaves (CV = 0.377; 0.74 n/g to 3.28 n/g). Partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) analysis further illustrated that MPs abundance on submerged mangrove leaves were negative correlated to hydrodynamic factors (i.e., current velocity and tidal range). Intriguingly, secreted salt as a significantly driver of MPs intercepted by mangrove leaves. Results of this work highlights that MPs intercepted by mangrove leaves is characterized by dynamic fluctuations and reveals the importance of hydrodynamic factors and secreted salt. Overall, this work identifies the pivotal buffering role played by mangrove leaves in intercepting MPs, which provides basic knowledge for better understanding of microplastic pollution status and control from mangrove plants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The ocean ecological environments are seriously affected by oil spilling and plastic-debris, preventing and significantly reducing marine pollution via using biocomposite production from natural fiber reinforcement is a more friendly way to deal with marine oil pollution. Herein, we upcycled coir-coconut into lignin and coconut shell into spherical TENG by a combination of dip-dry and chemical treatment and used the SiO2 nanoparticles together with cellulose nanofibrils to prepare serial sugar-templated, anisotropic and hybrid foams. The as-prepared lignin/SiO2 porous sponge (LSPS) with a hierarchical porous morphology and uniformly dispersed nanoparticles structure benefits from the advantages of biomass-based additives, which presents reversible large-strain deformation (50%) and high compressive strength (11.42 kpa). Notably, the LSPS was significantly more hydrophobic (WCA ≈150°) than pure silicone-based foams, and its selective absorbability can separate oil from water under continuous pumping. Meanwhile, the coconut husk was also upcycled as a spherical TENG shell by a combination of the nanofiber-enhanced polymer spherical oscillator (CESO), which possessed high triboelectric properties (Uoc = 272 V, Isc = 14.5 μA, Q = 70 nC) and was comparable to the plastic shell TENG at low frequency (1.6 Hz). The monolithic foam structure developed using this clean synthetic strategy holds considerable promise for new applications in sustainable petroleum contamination remediation. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.,\n",
       " Evidence of microplastic (MP) pollution in Antarctic terrestrial environments reinforces concerns about its potential impacts on soil, which plays a major role in ecological processes at ice-free areas. We investigated the effects of two common MP types on soil physicochemical properties and microbial responses of a marine terrace from Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica). Soils were treated with polyethylene (PE) fragments and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers at environmentally relevant doses (from 0.001% to 1% w w−1), in addition to a control treatment (0% w w−1), for 22 days in a pot incubation experiment under natural field conditions. The short-term impacts of MPs on soil physical, chemical and microbial attributes seem interrelated and were affected by both MP dose and type. The highest PAN fiber dose (0.1%) increased macro and total porosity, but decreased soil bulk density compared to control, whereas PE fragments treatments did not affect soil porosity. Soil respiration increased with increasing doses of PAN fibers reflecting impacts on physical properties. Both types of MPs increased microbial activity (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis), decreased the cation exchange capacity but, especially PE fragments, increased Na+ saturation. The highest dose of PAN fibers and PE fragments increased total nitrogen and total organic carbon, respectively, and both decreased the soil pH. We discussed potential causes for our findings in this initial assessment and addressed the need for further research considering the complexity of environmental factors to better understand the cumulative impacts of MP pollution in Antarctic soil environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The effluent of WWTPs is an important source of microplastics (MP) for the aquatic environment. In this review study, MPs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Türkiye and their removal from WWTPs are reviewed for the first time. First, MP characteristics in the influent and effluent of WWTPs in Türkiye are discussed. In the next section, the abundance of MPs in the influent and effluent of WWTPs in Türkiye and the MP removal efficiency of WWTPs in Türkiye are evaluated. Then, the results of studies on MP abundance and characteristics in Türkiye’s aquatic environments are presented and suggestions are made to reduce MPs released from WWTPs into the receiving environments. Strategies for reducing MPs released to the receiving environment from WWTPs of Türkiye are summarized. In the last section, research gaps regarding MPs in WWTPs in Türkiye are identified and suggestions are made for future studies. This review paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the abundance, dominant characteristics, and removal of MPs in WWTPs in Türkiye, as well as the current status and deficiencies in Türkiye. Therefore, this review can serve as a scientific guide to improve the MP removal efficiency of WWTPs in Türkiye. © 2024 IWA Publishing. All rights reserved.,\n",
       " In recent years, the production of plastic has been estimated to reach 300 million tonnes, and nearly the same amount has been dumped into the waters. This waste material causes long-term damage to the ecosystem, economic sectors, and aquatic environments. Fragmentation of plastics to microplastics has been detected in the world's oceans, which causes a serious global impact. It is found that most of this debris ends up in water environments. Hence, this research aims to review the microbial degradation of microplastic, especially in water bodies and coastal areas. Aerobic bacteria will oxidize and decompose the microplastic from this environment to produce nutrients. Furthermore, plants such as microalgae can employ this nutrient as an energy source, which is the byproduct of microplastic. This paper highlights the reduction of plastics in the environment, typically by ultraviolet reduction, mechanical abrasion processes, and utilization by microorganisms and microalgae. Further discussion on the utilization of microplastics in the current technologies comprised of mechanical, chemical, and biological methods focusing more on the microalgae and microbial pathways via fuel cells has been elaborated. It can be denoted in the fuel cell system, the microalgae are placed in the bio-cathode section, and the anode chamber consists of the colony of microorganisms. Hence, electric current from the fuel cell can be generated to produce clean energy. Thus, the investigation on the emerging technologies via fuel cell systems and the potential use of microplastic pollutants for consumption has been discussed in the paper. The biochemical changes of microplastic and the interaction of microalgae and bacteria towards the degradation pathways of microplastic are also being observed in this review. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic contamination is ubiquitous across the globe, even in remote locations. Still, the sources and pathways of microplastics to such locations are largely unknown. To investigate microplastic contamination in a semi-remote location, we measured microplastic concentrations in nine oligotrophic lakes within and around the International Institute for Sustainable Development—Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Our first objective was to establish ambient concentrations of microplastics in bottom sediments, surface water, and atmospheric deposition in semi-remote boreal lakes. Across all lakes, mean shallow and deep sediment microplastic concentrations, near-surface water microplastic concentrations from in situ filtering, and dry atmospheric microplastic deposition rates were 551 ± 354 particles kg−1, 177 ± 103 particles kg−1, 0.2 ± 0.3 particles L−1, and 0.4 ± 0.2 particles m−2 day−1, respectively. Our second objective was to investigate whether microplastic contamination of these lakes is driven by point sources including local runoff and direct anthropogenic inputs or nonpoint sources such as atmospheric deposition. Lakes were selected based on three levels of anthropogenic activity—low, medium, and high—though activity levels were minimal across all study lakes compared with highly populated areas. Whereas a positive correlation would indicate that point sources were a likely pathway, we observed no relationship between the level of anthropogenic activity and microplastic contamination of surface water. Moreover, the composition of microplastics in surface water and atmospheric deposition were similar, comprising mostly polyester and acrylic fibers. Together, these results suggest that atmospheric deposition may be the main pathway of microplastics to these remote boreal lakes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2024;43:999–1011. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Microplastics and other microscopic debris are a concern in the coastal environment but measurements in the water column and sediment are often problematic and rely on non-standardised and highly variable methodologies. To this end, we explore the potential of different species of temperate-cold marine macroalgae as passive biomonitors of anthropogenic microparticles at three contrasting locations in southwest England. Specifically, fronds from samples of fucoids and Ulva lactuca (n = 9 in total, and three from each location) have been sectioned and analysed directly under a microscope and anthropogenic microparticles counted and subsequently characterised for chemical composition. Microparticles were heterogeneously distributed throughout sections from the same sample. However, on a dry weight basis, combined microparticle concentrations for each sample ranged from about 7.5 g-1 to 110 g−1, and from about 0.2 cm−2 to 0.9 cm−2, and for a given species were higher in samples from a semi-enclosed harbour and urban beach than in samples from a protected beach facing the open sea. These values compare with published concentrations of microplastics and microfibres reported for the regional water column on the order of 0.1 m-3. Most particles were cellulosic (e.g., rayon) and petroleum-based (mainly polyester and polyethylene terephthalate) fibres but plastic fragments were also present on most samples. Glass retroreflective beads derived from road markings were also present at up to 18 g−1 on fucoids from the urban beach because of its proximity to a stormwater effluent. Most microparticles were adhered to the smooth parts of the macroalgal surface but some displayed wrapping around edges and creases or entrapment by appendages. The practical and environmental implications of macroalgae passively capturing significant quantities of anthropogenic microparticles are discussed. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study used correlation analyses to examine the microbial mechanisms linking microplastics and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in 18 typical lakes in Wuhan city. The microplastic abundances were 502 ± 212 items/m3 in the surface water and 305 ± 216 items/kg in dry sediments. The microplastics were predominantly black and fiber shaped in both surface water and sediments. The N2O flux was positively correlated with total phosphorus (p < 0.01), suspended particles (p < 0.01), total nitrogen (p < 0.05), and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (p < 0.01) in surface water. nirK/nosZ I was negatively correlated with the N2O flux and positively correlated with dissolved N2O concentration in surface water (p < 0.05). The microplastic abundance in surface water was positively correlated with nosZ II in water (p < 0.01) and nirK/nosZ I in sediment (p < 0.001). The microplastics in sediments were negatively correlated with nirK/nosZ I in water (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with nirS in sediment (p < 0.05). The predominant plastisphere denitrifiers in this study were nirS-type in sediments and nirK-type in surface water. The predominant denitrifier in surface water was Flavobacterium, where it had far higher relative abundances compared to sediments. The co-occurrence network between nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and water quality indexes implied that denitrifiers competed strongly in sediments, while they cooperated in surface water. Looking at the whole microbial community, the competitive and cooperative relationships were more complex in the sediment samples. The N2O flux was positively correlated with the plastic degradation function in sediment (p < 0.05), implying the plastisphere was a significant contributor. Microplastics in lakes, i.e., the plastisphere, may be a novel microbial colonization site that could be vital to ecosystem N2O emissions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic pollution, including micro- and nanoplastics, is a growing concern. Tyre-wear particles (TWPs) are the second largest source of microplastics in the ocean following abrasion of synthetic fibres. In addition to the particles themselves, TWPs contain many harmful chemicals, including 6PPD. This chemical reacts with atmospheric ozone and forms the toxic compound 6PPD-quinone (6PPDq), which poses a danger to aquatic life. There is a knowledge gap in understanding risks associated with the combined toxicity of nanoplastics (NPs) and 6PPDq. The present study aimed to investigate the toxicity of NPs and 6PPDq on adult zebrafish using phenotypic (behaviour, histology) and transcriptomic endpoints. Zebrafish were exposed to four treatments: control (contaminant-free), 50 μg/L 6PPDq, 3 mg/L polystyrene (PS)-NPs, and a combination of 50 μg/L 6PPDq and 3 mg/L PS-NPs. We did not observe locomotory dysregulation in zebrafish exposed to NPs. However, we found significant hyperlocomotion in zebrafish exposed to 6PPDq and this effect was even more substantial after co-exposure with PS-NPs. This study explores the molecular mechanisms behind these effects, identifying genes associated with neurotransmitters and fatty acid metabolism that were dysregulated by the co-exposure. Transcriptomic analysis further showed that both 6PPDq and PS-NPs impacted cellular processes associated with sterol biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism, and muscle tissue development. The effects on these mechanisms were stronger in co-exposed zebrafish, indicating a heightened risk to cellular integrity and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results highlight the significance of mixture toxicity when studying the effects of NPs and associated chemicals like 6PPDq. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) as the formidable pollutants with high toxicity and difficult degradation may threaten the aquaculture industry and human health, making it highly necessary to develop the effective removal methods. In this article, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were initially fabricated with mesoporous structure, but showing undesirable adsorption efficiencies for the adsorption of MPs (lower than 70%). Inspired by the reefs-rebuilding corals acting as the sinks for various marine pollutants like plastic, Fe3O4 NPs were coated further with adhesive polymerized dopamine (PDA) yielding Fe3O4@PDA absorbents. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that the corals-mimicking absorbents so formed could allow for the removal of MPs with dramatically enhanced efficiencies up to 98.5%, which is over about 30% higher than those of bare Fe3O4 NPs. Herein, the PDA shells might conduct the increased adhesion to MPs, presumably through the formation of hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. A fast (within 20 min) and stable adsorption of MPs can also be expected, in addition to the PDA-improved environmental storage of Fe3O4 NPs. Subsequently, the Fe3O4@PDA adsorbents were utilized to remove MPs from different water sources with high efficiencies, including pure water, suburban streams, village rivers, lake water, inner-city moats, and aquaculture water. Such a magnet-recyclable adsorbent may provide a new way for rapid, effective, and low-cost removal of MPs pollutants from various water systems. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.,\n",
       " Contamination of the environment by microplastics (MPs), polymer particles of <5 mm in diameter, is an emerging concern globally due to their ubiquitous nature, interactions with pollutants, and adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The majority of studies have focused on marine environments, with freshwater systems only recently attracting attention. The current study investigated the presence, abundance, and distribution of MPs and potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in sediments of the River Kelvin, Scotland, UK. Sediment samples were collected from eight sampling points along the river and were extracted by density separation with NaCl solution. Extracted microplastics were characterised for shape and colour, and the polymer types were determined through attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Pollution status and ecological risks were assessed for both the microplastics and PTEs. Abundance of MPs generally increased from the most upstream location (Queenzieburn, 50.0 ± 17.3 particles/kg) to the most downstream sampling point (Kelvingrove Museum, 244 ± 19.2 particles/kg). Fibres were most abundant at all sampling locations, with red, blue, and black being the predominant colours found. Larger polymer fragments were identified as polypropylene and polyethylene. Concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn exceeded Scottish background soil values at some locations. Principal component and Pearson’s correlation analyses suggest that As, Cr, Pb and Zn emanated from the same anthropogenic sources. Potential ecological risk assessment indicates that Cd presents a moderate risk to organisms at one location. This study constitutes the first co-investigation of MPs and PTEs in a river system in Scotland. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are compounds found in several environmental compartments whose ubiquitous presence can cause toxicity for the entire ecosystem. Several personal care products, including antibiotics, have entered this group of compounds, constituting a major global threat. It is essential to develop simple and reliable methods by which to quantify these contaminants in several matrices. In this work, mussels were chosen as sentinel organisms to assess environmental pollution and the safety of bivalve mollusk consumption according to the “One Health perspective”. A liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the quantification of two macrolides, erythromycin (ERY) and azithromycin (AZI), in mussels. This new method was validated according to international guidelines, showing high selectivity, good recoveries (>60% for both of them), sensitivity, and precision. The method was successfully applied for ERY and AZI research in mussels farmed along the Sardinian coasts (Italy), demonstrating itself to be useful for routine analysis by competent authorities. The tested macrolides were not determined in the analyzed sites at concentrations above the limits of detection (LODs). These results demonstrate the food safety of mussels (as concerns the studied antibiotics) and a negligible amount of pollution derived from these drugs in the studied area. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastic is an emerging pollutant and a technical fossil in Anthropocene sediments. Typhoon frequency and intensity have increased due to climate change, which has a major effect on the distribution patterns of microplastics. It is still unknown, though, how the topography of the peninsula affects the reconstruction of the distribution of microplastic in typhoons. Due to frequent typhoons, the Leizhou Peninsula (LZP) in the north part of the South China Sea is an ideal place to study the impact of topographic variations on microplastic distribution during typhoon events. This study investigated microplastics ranging in size from 50 μm to 5 mm in sediment. Microscopic inspection and μ-FTIR tests were used to identify microplastic characteristics from offshore surface sediments before and after typhoons. The average microplastic abundance in offshore sediments decreased from 18 ± 17 items/kg to 15 ± 15 items/kg after typhoons. Results show that typhoons only increase the microplastic abundance in topographically protected areas along the northeast coast of LZP, with no significant difference observed in other regions. The influence of typhoon on the morphological characteristics of microplastics in sediments is more pronounced and widespread, as evidenced by a shift in the predominant shape of microplastics from fibers to fragments and a decrease in size accompanied by an increased abundance within the 100 μm–1 mm fraction. The color of microplastics remained similar before and after typhoons, and the polymer composition of microplastics became more uniform. The alteration of microplastic morphology may be attributed to the enhancement of wave intensity induced by typhoons. This study enhances the comprehension of typhoon-induced impacts on pollutant redistribution, specifically microplastics, thereby providing essential empirical evidence and theoretical foundations for pollution regulation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Coral reefs are increasingly identified as microplastic sinks. Understanding the trapping and deposition effects on microplastics among coral colonies of different morphologies can help identify which corals and coral reefs are at higher risk of microplastic exposure. Here, we used a current-generating saltwater flume to explore microplastic trapping and deposition among branching coral, Pocillopora acuta, colonies with contrasting morphologies (open and compact), together with varying coral surface conditions (live, dead, and waxed), microplastic sizes (400 to 500 μm and 900 to 1000 μm), and seeding points (above-colony and mid-colony). Results revealed that more microplastics were trapped by, and deposited nearer to, compact colonies compared to those with a more open morphology—likely due to differences in flow dynamics. More of the larger microplastics were trapped, as were those introduced at the mid seeding point, but coral surface condition had no significant effect. These findings add to the growing evidence that corals are effective at trapping and facilitating deposition of microplastics. Branching corals with compact structures are potentially at high risk of microplastic pollution impact. We posit that coral composition, i.e. the relative abundance of compact branching colonies, will affect microplastic accumulation in natural reef environments. Synopsis: This study demonstrates the effects of coral morphology on microplastic trapping and deposition, providing mechanistic insights into the factors that contribute to coral reefs acting as microplastic sinks. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The widespread presence of micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) in the environment threatens ecosystem integrity, and thus, it is necessary to determine and assess the occurrence, characteristics, and transport of MNPs between ecological components. However, most analytical approaches are cost- and time-inefficient in providing quantitative information with sufficient detail, and interpreting results can be difficult. Alternative analyses integrating novel measurements by imaging or proximal sensing with signal processing and machine learning may supplement these approaches. In this review, we examined published research on methods used for the automated data interpretation of MNPs found in the environment or those artificially prepared by fragmenting bulk plastics. We critically reviewed the primary areas of the integrated analytical process, which include sampling, data acquisition, processing, and modeling, applied in identifying, classifying, and quantifying MNPs in soil, sediment, water, and biological samples. We also provide a comprehensive discussion regarding model uncertainties related to estimating MNPs in the environment. In the future, the development of routinely applicable and efficient methods is expected to significantly contribute to the successful establishment of automated MNP monitoring systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Throughout evolution, bacteria and other microorganisms have learned efficient foraging strategies that exploit characteristic properties of their unknown environment. While much research has been devoted to the exploration of statistical models describing the dynamics of foraging bacteria and other (micro-) organisms, little is known, regarding the question of how good the learned strategies actually are. This knowledge gap is largely caused by the absence of methods allowing to systematically develop alternative foraging strategies to compare with. In the present work, we use deep reinforcement learning to show that a smart run-and-tumble agent, which strives to find nutrients for its survival, learns motion patterns that are remarkably similar to the trajectories of chemotactic bacteria. Strikingly, despite this similarity, we also find interesting differences between the learned tumble rate distribution and the one that is commonly assumed for the run and tumble model. We find that these differences equip the agent with significant advantages regarding its foraging and survival capabilities. Our results uncover a generic route to use deep reinforcement learning for discovering search and collection strategies that exploit characteristic but initially unknown features of the environment. These results can be used, e.g., to program future microswimmers, nanorobots, and smart active particles for tasks like searching for cancer cells, micro-waste collection, or environmental remediation.

       " BACKGROUND: Global plastic use has consistently increased over the past century with several different types of plastics now being produced. Much of these plastics end up in oceans or landfills leading to a substantial accumulation of plastics in the environment. Plastic debris slowly degrades into microplastics (MPs) that can ultimately be inhaled or ingested by both animals and humans. A growing body of evidence indicates that MPs can cross the gut barrier and enter into the lymphatic and systemic circulation leading to accumulation in tissues such as the lungs, liver, kidney, and brain. The impacts of mixed MPs exposure on tissue function through metabolism remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the impacts of polymer microspheres on tissue metabolism in mice by assessing the microspheres abil-ity to translocate across the gut barrier and enter into systemic circulation. Specifically, we wanted to examine microsphere accumulation in different organ systems, identify concentration-dependent metabolic changes, and evaluate the effects of mixed microsphere exposures on health outcomes. METHODS: To investigate the impact of ingested microspheres on target metabolic pathways, mice were exposed to either polystyrene (5 lm) micro-spheres or a mixture of polymer microspheres consisting of polystyrene (5 lm), polyethylene (1–4 lm), and the biodegradability and biocompatible plastic, poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (5 lm). Exposures were performed twice a week for 4 weeks at a concentration of either 0, 2, or 4 mg=week via oral gastric gavage. Tissues were collected to examine microsphere ingress and changes in metabolites. RESULTS: In mice that ingested microspheres, we detected polystyrene microspheres in distant tissues including the brain, liver, and kidney. Additionally, we report on the metabolic differences that occurred in the colon, liver, and brain, which showed differential responses that were dependent on concentration and type of microsphere exposure. DISCUSSION: This study uses a mouse model to provide critical insight into the potential health implications of the pervasive issue of plastic pollution. These findings demonstrate that orally consumed polystyrene or mixed polymer microspheres can accumulate in tissues such as the brain, liver, and kidney. Furthermore, this study highlights concentration-dependent and polymer type-specific metabolic changes in the colon, liver, and brain after plastic microsphere exposure. These results underline the mobility within and between biological tissues of MPs after exposure and emphasize the importance of understanding their metabolic impact. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13435. © 2024, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

       " Determining the sources of marine litter is necessary to mitigate this increasing global problem. Plastic bottles are useful tracers of marine litter and constitute the main item (24%) stranding on remote beaches in the Galapagos Islands. The aim of this study was to estimate the abundance of plastic bottles in remote beaches and inferred their sources. To do so, we collected plastic bottles at 60 remote Galapagos Island beaches from 2018 to 2022. 76% of beaches were qualified as badly polluted, with >34 bottles·100 m−1. Most identified bottles came from Peru (71%), followed by China (17%) and Ecuador (9%). Although most locally-sold products are made in Ecuador, they contribute little to beach litter loads. Polyethylene terephthalate bottles with lid (necessary for litter dispersal) represented 88% of all bottles, demonstrating that most of the litter reaching the Galapagos comes from distant sources, mainly from South America. However, bottle ages indicate that at least 10% of Peruvian, 26% of Ecuadorian, and all Chinese bottles likely were dumped from ships. Reducing marine litter reaching the Galapagos Islands requires tackling litter leakage from land-based sources in South America and better compliance with regulations banning the dumping of plastics and other persistent wastes from ships. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The abundance of air pollutants over the last few years, including the concentration of microplastics, has become an alarming concern across the world. Initially discovered in marine life, these toxic and inflammatory particles have recently been found in human lung tissues. When inhaled, these harmful particles settle down in the lung airways and, over time, lead to respiratory failures. A recent study analyzed the microplastic transport behavior in the mouth-throat airways. However, the knowledge of the microplastic migration in bifurcating tracheobronchial airways is missing in the literature. Therefore, this first-ever study analyzes in detail the transport behavior and settling patterns of microplastic particles of different sizes and shapes at different respiratory intensities in the tracheobronchial lung airways. A numerical technique based on discrete phase modeling is employed to simulate the flow of microplastic particles in a three-dimensional realistic lung geometry. The numerical model results indicate low velocity and turbulence intensity magnitudes with smooth flow in the trachea compared to the airways of left and right lobes, which experience higher velocities and generate secondary vortices. Lower lung lobes are the deposition hotspots for the harmful microplastic particles at a lower flow rate. These hotspots shift to upper lung lobes at a higher flow rate for the same particle size. Moreover, microplastic particle size and shape influence the overall deposition rate in the tracheobronchial lung airways. The results of the current study, including microplastic accumulation regions at different breathing intensities, will contribute to the updated knowledge of pollutant inhalation and facilitate relevant treatment measures. © 2024 Author(s).,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have been recognized as a serious new pollutant, especially nanoplastics (NPs) pose a greater threat to marine ecosystem than larger MPs. Within these ecosystems, phytoplankton serve as the foundational primary producers, playing a critical role in carbon sequestration. Copper (Cu), a vital cofactor for both photosynthesis and respiration in phytoplankton, directly influences their capacity to regulate atmospheric carbon. Therefore, we assessed the impact of NPs on Cu bioavailability and carbon sequestration capacity. The results showed that polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) could inhibit the growth of Thalassiosira weissflogii (a commonly used model marine diatom) and Chlorella pyrenoidosa (a standard strain of green algae). The concentration of Cu uptake by algae has a significant negative correlation with COPT1 (a Cu uptake protein), but positive with P-ATPase (a Cu efflux protein). Interestingly, PS-NPs exposure could reduce Cu uptake and carbon Cu sequestration capacity of algae, i.e., when the concentration of PS-NPs increases by 1 mg/L, the concentration of fixed carbon dioxide decreases by 0.0023 ppm. This provides a new perspective to reveal the influence mechanisms of PS-NPs on the relationship between Cu biogeochemical cycling and carbon source and sink. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Significant concerns on a global scale have been raised in response to the potential adverse impacts of emerging pollutants (EPs) on aquatic creatures. We have carefully reviewed relevant research over the past 10 years. The study focuses on five typical EPs: pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), drinking water disinfection byproducts (DBPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and microplastics (MPs). The presence of EPs in the global aquatic environment is source-dependent, with wastewater treatment plants being the main source of EPs. Multiple studies have consistently shown that the final destination of most EPs in the water environment is sludge and sediment. Simultaneously, a number of EPs, such as PFASs, MPs, and BFRs, have long-term environmental transport potential. Some EPs exhibit notable tendencies towards bioaccumulation and biomagnification, while others pose challenges in terms of their degradation within both biological and abiotic treatment processes. The results showed that, in most cases, the ecological risk of EPs in aquatic environments was low, possibly due to potential dilution and degradation. Future research topics should include adding EPs detection items for the aquatic environment, combining pollution, and updating prediction models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Today, the world is struggling with the colossal amount of microplastics (MPs) due to the tremendous increase in the global production. Presence of MPs in the water samples, biological samples, and its potential to carry lethal chemicals raised the interest on better management of MPs. However, an effective degradation methodology is necessary to decrease the prolonged lifetime of such polymeric materials. So far, very limited reports are available on the degradation methods such as photo-oxidation, biodegradation, photo-thermal oxidative process, subsequent mechanisms involved during the degradation of MPs. Many critical challenges pertaining to those are poorly understood. Particularly, the extraction process, reliable methods to degrade MPs and their analytical techniques, level of MPs contamination in commercially caught fishes and the population at large. Here, we have revisited shortly on current MPs extraction process, various degradation methods using catalyst with their respective mechanisms. Also, the role of most common analytical methods/tools, to identify, analyse the degraded product from MPs, both environment samples and experimental samples, were elaborated. Finally, the solutions to overcome the problems were identified.

       " Assessing the profitability of river restoration requires knowledge of the importance of individual ecosystem elements for the value of specific ecosystem services. The aim of this study was to experimentally estimate the effect of the presence of bed load on the processes of water self-purification from suspended solids, organic matter and microplastic fibres. The experiment was carried out in channels with and without bed load, simulating conditions in a lowland river. The system was supplemented with artificial sewage containing FPOM and polypropylene fibres. Changes in the amount of suspended solids in the water, as well as organic matter and microplastics in the water and sediment, were recorded over the course of a week. The presence of a bed load increased the rate of suspension removal from the river water many times over. The decomposition rate of organic matter in the sediment was much higher than in the water, reaching 1 g of organic carbon per week. Bed load favoured the immobilisation of large microplastic fibres, facilitating their incorporation into bottom biofilms. The fibres formed a 'skeleton' that led to the formation of larger bed load biofilms. The study suggests that, even without restoring the connection between river water and groundwater, the supply of bed load to the river significantly increases the efficiency of natural processes in the river ecosystem, including self-purification. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic pollution poses a serious risk globally and is having a major adverse impact on nearly every marine and freshwater ecosystem on the planet. The plastic trash collected from the marine environment, can harm marine ecosystems and humans. While there are several challenges to manufacture products from recycled marine plastics, including a high price and consumer demand for high-quality recycled materials, efforts, and research to recycle marine plastics are critical. One promising application of recycled marine plastics is blending recycled polyethylene terephthalate (re-PET) with other polymers, such as polycarbonate (PC), to reproduce desired physical properties in composites. In this study, we investigated the optimal ratio of PC and ocean-bound plastic (OBP), recycled PET (re-PET) as a composite material suitable for sustainable electronic device covers, and analyzed its physicochemical properties. The results showed that PC/re-PET5 composites containing 5% re-PET recycled from OBP had the most suitable properties for electronic device covers. Developing composite materials using recycled plastics represents a promising stride towards advancing the principles of a circular economy and fostering sustainable product design. © The Korean Ceramic Society 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is a global and ubiquitous environmental problem in the oceans as well as in the terrestrial environment. We examined the fate of microplastic polystyrene (MPS) beads in experimental soil in the presence and absence of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and simulated acid rain (SAR) to determine whether the combinations of these three factors altered the growth of white clover Trifolium repens. We found that MPS, SAR, or AMF added singly to soil did not alter T. repens growth or yields. In contrast, MPS and AMF together significantly reduced shoot biomass, while SAR and MPS together significantly reduced soil available phosphorus independent of AMF presence. Microplastic polystyrene, AMF, and SAR together significantly reduced soil NO3--N. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi added singly also enriched the beneficial soil bacteria (genus Solirubrobacter), while MPS combined with AMF significantly enriched the potential plant pathogenic fungus Spiromastix. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation with MPS increased the abundance of soil hydrocarbon degraders independent of the presence of SAR. In addition, the abundance of soil nitrate reducers was increased by MPS, especially in the presence of AMF and SAR. Moreover, SAR alone increased the abundance of soil pathogens within the fungal community including antibiotic producers. These findings indicate that the coexistence of MPS, SAR, and AMF may exacerbate the adverse effects of MPS on soil and plant health. © 2024 Soil Science Society of China,\n",
       " In the 21st Century, marine plastic pollution emerges as a prominent wicked issue, posing threats to planetary boundaries, biological and anthropogenic systems. Such complex and multiscale issues significantly contribute to the degradation of our land and ocean ecosystem. For example, loss of aquatic life due to ghost fishing or microplastic pollution from broken-down plastics in the oceans. These 'wicked societal issues' can no longer be resolved through our existing societal structures and methods. The aquaculture and fisheries sectors are significant contributors to plastic marine debris globally. However, research and practices on this matter have been fragmented, siloed, and often limited to specific value chain sections (material science, waste). If more sustainable circular practices are to be realised in the use and management of plastic in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, interdisciplinary-cross sector co-operation is required, which addresses such global issues at the local level. Using Norway and early findings from the SHIFTPLASTICs project as a case study, this paper presents how interdisciplinary co-production framed by the Systems Design Approach + has enabled creative spaces whereby: 1) a clear identification of the most problematic areas of plastic pollution across the whole service model value chain, and, 2) targeted measures in enabling the transition to more sustainable circular practices and plastic pollution mitigation in the sectors. Key findings include the logic, development, application, and outcomes of the SDA + methodological approach. This includes enabling interdisciplinary co-development and critiquing the Norwegian service model value chain of plastic pollution in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The identification and potential solutions in tackling 16-plastic pollution ‘hot spots’ of the most problematic plastic-based products for the sectors. We conclude that the Systems Design Approach + framework, as undertaken, has enabled collaborative spaces and interactions suitable to generate knowledge, insights, tool development, and creativity in pursuit of innovation and circular transitions for these wicked societal issue. This approach has potential for scalability. © 2024,\n",
       " In recent years, the presence of pharmaceuticals and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic ecosystems has raised concerns about their environmental impact. This study explores the combined effects of caffeine, a common pharmaceutical pollutant, and MPs on the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Caffeine, at concentrations of 20.0 μg L−1, and MPs (1 mg L−1, 35–50 μm size range), was used to mimic real-world exposure scenarios. Two hundred M. galloprovincialis specimens were divided into four groups: caffeine, MPs, Mix (caffeine + MPs), and Control. After a two-week acclimation period, the mollusks were subjected to these pollutants in oxygen-aerated aquariums under controlled conditions for 14 days. Histopathological assessments were performed to evaluate gill morphology. Cellular volume regulation and digestive gland cell viability were also analyzed. Exposure to caffeine and MPs induced significant morphological changes in M. galloprovincialis gills, including cilia loss, ciliary disk damage, and cellular alterations. The chitinous rod supporting filaments also suffered damage, potentially due to MP interactions, leading to hemocyte infiltration and filament integrity compromise. Hemocytic aggregation suggested an inflammatory response to caffeine. In addition, viability assessments of digestive gland cells revealed potential damage to cell membranes and function, with impaired cell volume regulation, particularly in the Mix group, raising concerns about nutrient metabolism disruption and organ function compromise. These findings underscore the vulnerability of M. galloprovincialis to environmental pollutants and emphasize the need for monitoring and mitigation efforts. Research Highlights: The synergy of caffeine and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic ecosystems warrants investigation. MPs and caffeine could affect gill morphology of Mytilus galloprovincialis. Caffeine-exposed cells had lower viability than the control group in the NR retention test. MPs and mix-exposed cells struggled to recover their volume. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Marine debris pollution in wetlands is a largely neglected problem despite its impact on the biodiversity. This manuscript presents the findings of a comprehensive study conducted in the Point Calimere wetland, spanning March 2022 to February 2023, to assess the abundance, composition, and sources of anthropogenic debris. During the survey, 1760 debris items weighing 192.51 kg were collected from fifteen transects, revealing significant variations in both count and weight across the sampling sites. Plastic debris was predominant in terms of both count and weight, followed by cloth/fabric. They emerged as the most prevalent type, exhibiting the widest count range and maximum abundance per transect. Specific debris types, such as plastic rope/small net pieces, were more prevalent in both count and weight. Analysis of debris per square meter indicated an average abundance of 1.23 ± 1.17 items and an average weight of 144.34 ± 70.01 g. Statistical analysis confirmed the significant influence of transects and quadrats on debris count abundance, with varying effects across different transects. The study also identified shoreline and recreational activities and ocean/water activities as primary sources of marine debris. Land-based sources had a higher count, while sea-based sources contributed more to the overall weight. These findings provide valuable insights into marine debris distribution, composition, and sources, which can inform targeted mitigation strategies and conservation efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Considerable research has been conducted to evaluate microplastics (MPs) as vehicles for the transfer of hazardous pollutants in organisms. However, little effort has been devoted to the chemical release of hazardous additive-derived pollutants from MPs in gut simulations. This study looked at the leaching kinetics of organophosphate esters (OPFRs) from polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) MPs in the presence of gut surfactants, specifically sodium taurocholate, at two biologically relevant temperatures for marine organisms. Diffusion coefficients of OPFRs ranged from 1.71 × 10−20 to 4.04 × 10−18 m2 s−1 in PP and 2.91 × 10−18 to 1.51 × 10−15 m2 s−1 in PS. The accumulation factors for OPFRs in biota-plastic and biota-sediment interactions ranged from 1.52 × 10−3−69.1 and 0.02−0.7, respectively. Based on B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) calculations, the biodynamic model analysis revealed a slight increase in the bioaccumulation of OPFRs at a minor dose of 0.05% MPs. However, at higher concentrations (0.5% and 5% MPs), there was a decrease in bioaccumulation compared to the lower concentration for most OPFR compounds. In general, the ingestion of PE MPs notably contributed to the bioaccumulation of OPFRs in lugworms, whereas the contribution of PP and PS MPs was minimal. This could vary among sites exhibiting varying levels of MP concentrations or MPs displaying stronger affinities towards chemicals. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a pressing global concern. Oysters are well-known filter feeders who ingest food by filtering microscopic particles suspended in the surrounding water. Along with organic matter, filter-feeding also causes accidental ingestion of MP by oysters. Hence, the aim of the current investigation is to understand the MP contamination in filter-feeding oysters. A total of 500 specimens of oyster Saccostrea cuccullata collected from the intertidal zone of five sampling locations on the Gujarat coast, India. Specimens underwent analysis following established protocols. Each specimen was found to exhibit MP contamination, showing an abundance of 2.72 ± 1.98 MPs/g. A negative relationship was found between shell length and MP abundance. Predominantly, fibers were documented across all study sites. Black, blue, and red-colored MPs with 1–2 mm sizes were most dominant. MP polymer composition was identified as polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. Findings provide baseline information on levels of MPs contamination, which can be used to monitor future effects of MP pollution. © 2024,\n",
       " Climate change and plastic pollution are the big environmental problems that the environment and humanity have faced in the past and will face in many decades to come. Sediments are affected by many pollutants and conditions, and the behaviors of microorganisms in environment may be influenced due to changes in sediments. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the differential effects of various microplastics and temperature on different sediments through the metabolic and oxidative responses of gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sediments collected from various fields including beaches, deep-sea discharge, and marine industrial areas. Each sediment was extracted and then treated with various microplastics under different temperature (−18, +4, +20 and 35 °C) for seven days. Then microplastics were removed from the suspension and microplastic-exposed sediment samples were incubated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to test bacterial activity, biofilm, and oxidative characteristics. The results showed that both the activity and the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased with the temperature of microplastic treatment in the experimental setups at the rates between an average of 2–39 % and 5–27 %, respectively. The highest levels of bacterial activity and biofilm formation were mainly observed in the beach area (average rate +25 %) and marine industrial (average rate +19 %) sediments with microplastic contamination, respectively. Moreover, oxidative characteristics significantly linked the bacterial activities and biofilm formation. The oxidative indicators of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that catalase and glutathione reductase were more influenced by microplastic contamination of various sediments than superoxide dismutase activities. For instance, catalase and glutathione reductase activities were changed between −37 and +169 % and +137 to +144 %, respectively; however, the superoxide dismutase increased at a rate between +1 and + 21 %. This study confirmed that global warming as a consequence of climate change might influence the effect of microplastic on sediments regarding bacterial biochemical responses and oxidation characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " Microplastics are found in continental and oceanic waters worldwide, but their spatial distribution shows an intricate pattern. Their driving factors remain difficult to identify and widely discussed due to insufficient and unstandardized monitoring data. Here, based on in situ experiments and hundreds of river samples from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we formulate a model to standardize aquatic microplastic measurements. The model was applied to existing data on a global scale. These data are standardized to a 20 µm mesh size, resulting in a new spatial distribution of aquatic microplastic densities, with average concentrations of 554.93 ± 1352.42 items/m3 in Europe, 2558.90 ± 4799.62 in North America and 1741.94 ± 3225.09 in Asia. Excessive contaminations (microplastic concentration > 10⁴ items/m3) are in the Yangtze River, the Charleston Harbor Estuary, the Bodega Bay and the Winyah Bay. We show that, based on these standardized concentrations, new driving factors could be used to predict the global or regional microplastic distribution in continental waters, such as the Human Development Index with a correlation of 75.86% on a global scale, the nighttime lights with a correlation of 37.26 ± 0.30% in Europe and 39.02 ± 0.54% in Asia, and the Mismanagement Plastic Waste with a correlation of 61.21 ± 19.86% in North America. Mapping standardized concentrations of aquatic microplastics enables a better comparison of contamination levels between regions and reveals more accurate hotspots to better adapt remediation efforts and future plastic pollution scenarios. © 2024,\n",
       " Litter pollution is a growing concern, including for Antarctica and the species that inhabit this ecosystem. In this study, we investigated the microplastic contamination in three seal species that inhabit the Western Antarctic Peninsula: crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) seals. Given the worldwide ubiquity of this type of contaminant, including the Southern Ocean, we hypothesized that the three seal species would present anthropogenic debris in their feces. We examined 29 scat samples of crabeater (n = 5), leopard (n = 13) and Weddell (n = 11) seals. The chemical composition of the items found were identified using micro-Raman and micro-FTIR spectroscopies. All the samples of the three species presented anthropic particles (frequency of occurrence - %FO – 100 %). Fibers were the predominant debris, but fragments and filaments were also present. Particles smaller than 5 mm (micro debris) were predominant in all the samples. Leopard seals ingested significantly larger micro-debris in comparison with the other seal species. The dominant color was black followed by blue and white. Micro-Raman and micro-FTIR Spectroscopies revealed the presence of different anthropogenic pigments such as reactive blue 238, Indigo 3600 and copper phthalocyanine (blue and green). Carbon black was also detected in the samples, as well as plastic polymers such as polystyrene, polyester and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide, polypropylene and polyurethane These results confirm the presence of anthropogenic contamination in Antarctic seals and highlight the need for actions to mitigate the effects and reduce the contribution of debris in the Antarctic ecosystem. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in the oceans is increasing, yet most global sea surface data is collected using plankton nets which limits our knowledge of the smaller and more bioaccessible size fraction of microplastics (<5 mm). We sampled the biodiverse coastal waters of the Galapagos Island of San Cristobal, comparing two different microplastic sampling methodologies; 1 l whole seawater grab samples filtered to 1.2 μm and sea surface plankton tows with a net mesh size of 200 μm. Our data reveal high concentrations of microplastics in Galapagos coastal waters surrounding the urban area, averaging 11.5 ± 1.48 particles l−1, with a four-order of magnitude increase in microplastic abundance observed using grab sampling compared with 200 μm plankton nets. This increase was greater when including anthropogenic cellulose particles, averaging 19.8 ± 1.86 particles l−1. Microplastic and anthropogenic cellulose particles smaller than 200 μm comprised 44 % of the particles from grab samples, suggesting previous estimates of microplastic pollution based on plankton nets likely miss and therefore underestimate these smaller particles. The particle characteristics and distribution of these smaller particles points strongly to a local input of cellulosic fibres in addition to the microplastic particles transported longer distances via the Humbolt current found across the surface seawater of the Galapagos. Improving our understanding of particle characteristics and distributions to highlight likely local sources will facilitate the development of local mitigation and management plans to reduce the input and impacts of microplastics to marine species, not just in the Galapagos but globally. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " While scientific research and media coverage has led to some legislation and policy changes in relation to the plastic pollution problem, in general these developments have been uncoordinated. In 2022 the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) resolution to end plastic pollution became the first legally binding provision to address the problem; it includes a requirement for multi-level stakeholder action agendas. In this research, we examine how key stakeholders with management responsibilities within a coastal area on the south coast of the United Kingdom view the issue of coastal microplastics. We find that stakeholders are susceptible to the same influences as the public and are focussed on the global rather than the local issues of plastic pollution. We also find that visitors to these coastal areas appear to be unconcerned about the potential threat caused by MP either due to a lack of awareness or assessment of risk. The research also highlights the management priorities amongst the stakeholders and makes recommendations for a more localised approach to implementing management policies in the future. © 2024,\n",
       " As millions of tonnes of plastics wind up in the environment, plastic pollution is a severe issue that worsens with time. In addition to primary plastic particles, large plastic items are fragmented due to ultraviolet radiation, degradation, and other environmental causes, resulting in minuscule compounds, known as microplastics or nanoplastics. They adsorb hazardous contaminants or easily get absorbed by organisms, for example, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or heavy metals get adhered to microplastic surfaces due to their tiny size and large surface area. Studies on their toxicity and environmental fate are crucial in light of these challenges, but their effectiveness depends on sampling procedure, sample preparation, characterization, analysis, and quantification techniques. The standard methods for the characterization of microplastics are performed using Fourier transform infrared resonance, Raman Spectroscopy, and pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Unfortunately, none of these techniques can achieve in-situ non-invasive characterization. These processes are complex, non-uniform across the studies, and different for specific sampling domains such as soil/sediment, surface water or groundwater, biota, and atmosphere. Thus, the current study highlights a specific methodology being used for sampling, sample preparation, characterization, and analysis from solid, aqueous, air, or biota samples. This review paper also specifies the characterization tool and quantification of microplastic concentration and types in the different environmental samples. Future studies on microplastics should prioritize the development of standardized sampling protocols to ensure comparability across diverse ecosystems. Additionally, employing advanced analytical techniques and collaborating across interdisciplinary fields can enhance the accuracy and reliability of microplastic separation and quantification methods. © 2024,\n",
       " The microplastic pollution in freshwater system is gradually becoming more severe, which has led to increasing attention on the distribution and potential harmful effects of microplastics. Moreover, microplastics may have an impact on river ecology and pose risks to ecosystems. Therefore, it is important to reveal this process. This study aimed to explore correlations between microplastics and free-living microorganisms in an urban drinking water source of Xiangjiang River by using multivariate statistical analysis. The results indicated that the abundance of microplastics (size 50 μm to 5 mm) in surface water and sediments ranged from 0.72 to 18.6 (mean ± SD: 7.32 ± 2.36) items L−1 and 26.3–302 (150 ± 75.6) items kg−1 dry weight (dw), respectively, suggesting potential microplastic pollution despite the protected status as a drinking water source. Higher microplastic abundances were observed in urban areas and the downstream of wastewater plants, with mostly granular shape, transparent and black color as well as 50–100 μm in size. The multivariate statistical analysis presented that the abundance of microplastics is not significantly correlated with water indicators, due to the complexity of the abundance data. The water indicators showed an obvious correlation with microplastics in colors of transparent and black, and smaller sizes of 50–100 μm. This is also true for microplastics and microorganisms in water and sediment. Proteobacteria was the main prokaryote in water and sediments, being positively correlated with 50–100 μm microplastics; while Chloroplastida was the dominated eukaryotes, presenting a weak correlation with smaller-size microplastics. Overall, when considering the properties of microplastics such as shape, color and size, the potential correlations with water indicators and microorganisms were more evident than abundance. This study provides new insights into the multivariate statistical analysis, explaining the potential correlations among microplastic properties, microorganisms and environmental factors in a river system. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The environmental risks arising from ubiquitous microplastics or plastic debris (PD) acting as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have attracted widespread attention. Enormous amounts of plastic waste are transported by rivers and traverse estuaries into the sea every year. However, changes in the antibiotic resistome within the plastisphere (the biofilms formed on PD) as PD travels through estuaries are largely unknown. In this study, we performed sequential migration incubations for PD along Haihe Estuary to simulate the natural process of PD floating from rivers to the ocean. Metagenomic sequencing and analysis techniques were used to track microbial communities and antibiotic resistome on migrating PD and in seawater representing the marine environment. The total relative gene copies of ARGs on traveling PD remained stable. As migration between greatly varied waters, additional ARG subtypes were recruited to the plastisphere. Above 80 % ARG subtypes identified in the plastisphere were persistent throughout the migration, and over 30 % of these persistent ARGs were undetected in seawater. The bacterial hosts composition of ARGs on PD progressively altered as transported downstream. Human pathogenic bacteria carrying ARGs (HPBs-ARG) exhibited decreasing trends in abundance and species number during transfer. Individual HPBs-ARG persisted on transferred PD and were absent in seawater samples, comprising Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Based on all detected ARGs and HPBs-ARG, the Projection Pursuit model was applied to synthetically evaluate the potential risks of antibiotic resistance on migrating PD. Diminished risks on PD were observed upon the river-to-sea journey but consistently remained significantly higher than in seawater. The potential risks posed to marine environments by drifting PD as dispersal vectors for antibiotic resistance deserve greater attention. Our results provide initial insights into the dynamics or stability of antibiotic resistome on PD crossing distinct aquatic systems in field estuaries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a rising environmental issue, with millions of tons of plastic debris collecting in the world's seas and on its shores. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become increasingly widely used as a more precise approach that can identify targets in remote sensing aquatic missions. The interference from other beach materials, and the need for proper identification of litter types can make identifying dumped plastics on sand-surrounded beaches challenging. This study lays the groundwork for a physical laboratory setting for images captured by a hyperspectral (HS) imager. The suggested testing setup included the development of a fluorescence signature for the target theater of operations (low-density polyethylene (LD-PE) and wood surrounded by sand) for detecting polymers in a simulated beach environment using the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) approach. Initially using broadband-spectrum light, strong sample diffuse reflectance contrast is observed in the imaging at wavelengths between 400 and 460 nm. Next, a dedicated LIF system for plastic litter discovery was developed using an ultraviolet (UV) laser source. Initial findings show that there is a distinct fluorescence signal for plastics at 450 nm and at 750 nm for wood. Our pilot studies support current efforts to determine the optimum spectral signature that these polymers will appear with clarity on shorelines using an inexpensive imagery combined with our UV LIF approach, which may have an impact on applications for the detection of beach pollution. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to construct reliable aerial conventional cameras for plastic waste environmental monitoring and management. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is overflowing in rivers. A limited understanding of the physics of plastic transport in rivers hinders monitoring, the prediction of plastic fate and restricts the implementation of effective mitigation strategies. This study investigates two unexplored aspects of plastic transport dynamics across the near-surface, suspended and bed load layers: (i) the complex settling behaviour of plastics and (ii) their influence on plastic transport in river-like flows. Through hundreds of settling tests and thousands of 3D reconstructed plastic transport experiments, our findings show that plastics exhibit unique settling patterns and orientations, due to their geometric anisotropy, revealing a multimodal distribution of settling velocities. In the transport experiments, particle-bed interactions enhanced mixing beyond what established turbulent transport theories (Rouse profile) could predict in low-turbulence conditions, which extends the bed load layer beyond the classic definition of the bed load layer thickness for natural sediments. We propose a new vertical structure of turbulent transport equation that considers the stochastic nature of heterogeneous negatively buoyant plastics and their singularities. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution is widely investigated owing to its potential threats to river ecosystems. However, it remains unclear whether hydraulic disturbance deepens or mitigates the effects of MPs-contaminated sediments on the river environment. Herein, we studied the impact of sediment aggregates, organic matter, and enzyme activity, with emphasis on microbial community structure and function in sediments exposed to MPs (1 %, 5 %, and 10 % w/w) in conjunction with hydraulic disturbance. The experimental results showed that the influence of MPs on the sediment under hydraulic disturbance is more significant than that of static culture, especially for various environmental factors (MWD, MBC, and sucrase activity etc.). The proportions of the >0.05 mm-fraction aggregates increased from 74–76 % to 82–88 % in the sediment throughout the entire disturbance process. It has been found that the disturbance generally promotes the interaction between MPs and sediments. FAPROTAX analysis demonstrated that the disturbance reduced the difference in effects on microbial functional genes between the control group and the MPs-added groups by up to 10 times, suggesting that the effects of disturbance on MPs-contaminated sediments are relatively complex. This work provides new insights into the effects of hydraulic disturbance on physicochemical properties and microbial communities of MPs-contaminated sediment. © 2024,\n",
       " Micro/nano-plastics (MPs/NPs) represent an emerging contaminant, posing a significant threat to oceanic halobios. While the adverse effects of joint pollutants on marine organisms are well-documented, the potential biological impacts on the food chain transmission resulting from combinations of MPs/NPs and heavy metals (HMs) remain largely unexplored. This study exposed the microbial loop to combined contaminants (MPs/NPs + HMs) for 48h, bacteria and contaminants are washed away before feeding to the traditional food chain, employing microscopic observation, biochemical detection, and transcriptome analysis to elucidate the toxicological mechanisms of the top predator. The findings revealed that MPs/NPs combined with Cd2+ could traverse both the microbial loop and classical food chain. Acute exposure significantly affected the carbon biomass of the top predator Tigriopus japonicus (75.8% lower). Elevated antioxidant enzyme activity led to lipid peroxidation, manifesting in increased malondialdehyde levels. Transcriptome sequencing showed substantial differential gene expression levels in T. japonicus under various treatments. The upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and inflammatory responses, highlighting the impact of co-exposure on oxidative damage and necroptosis within cells. Notably, NPs-Cd exhibited stronger toxicity than MPs-Cd. NPs-Cd led to a greater decrease in the biomass of top predators, accompanied by lower activities of GSH, SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX, resulting in increased production of lipid peroxidation product MDA and higher oxidative stress levels. This investigation provides novel insights into the potential threats of MPs/NPs combined with Cd2+ on the microbial loop across traditional food chain, contributing to a more comprehensive assessment of the ecological risks associated with micro/nano-plastics and heavy metals. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The co-occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and nano-microplastic pollution in the water is becoming an emerging risk. To assess the combined hepatotoxicity of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on zebrafish (Danio rerio), male adult zebrafish were exposed to single MC-LR (0, 1, 5, 25 μg/L) and a mixture of MC-LR and PSMPs (100 μg/L). After 60 d exposure, the results indicated that PSMPs significantly increased the MC-LR bioaccumulation in the livers in contrast to the single 25 μg/L MC-LR treatment group. Moreover, the severity of hepatic pathological lesions was aggravated in the MC-LR + PSMPs treatment groups, which were mainly characterized by cellular vacuolar degeneration, swollen hepatocytes, and pyknotic nucleus. The ultrastructural changes also proved that PSMPs combined with MC-LR could enhance the swollen mitochondria and dilated endoplasmic reticulum. The biochemical results, including increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased glutathione (GSH), indicated that PSMPs intensified the MC-LR-induced oxidative damage in the combined treatment groups. Concurrently, alterations of sod1 and keap1a mRNA levels also confirmed that PSMPs together with MC-LR jointly lead to enhanced oxidative injury. Our findings demonstrated that PSMPs enhanced the MC-LR bioavailability by acting as a vector and exacerbating the hepatic injuries and antioxidant dysfunction in zebrafish. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution poses a global concern, especially for benthic invertebrates. This one-month study investigated the accumulation of small MP polymers (polypropylene and polyester resin, 3–500 μm, 250 μg L−1) in benthic invertebrates and on one alga species. Results revealed species-specific preferences for MP size and type, driven by ingestion, adhesion, or avoidance behaviours. Polyester resin accumulated in Mytilus galloprovincialis, Chamelea gallina, Hexaplex trunculus, and Paranemonia cinerea, while polypropylene accumulated on Ulva rigida. Over time, MP accumulation decreased in count but not size, averaging 6.2 ± 5.0 particles per individual after a month. MP were mainly found inside of the organisms, especially in the gut, gills, and gonads and externally adherent MP ranged from 11 to 35 % of the total. Biochemical energy assessments after two weeks of MP exposure indicated energy gains for water column species but energy loss for sediment-associated species, highlighting the susceptibility of infaunal benthic communities to MP contamination. © 2024,\n",
       " This review explains the sources of nanoplastics (NPs) and microplastics (MPs), their release, fate, and associated health risks in the aquatic environment. In the 21st century, scientists are grappling with a major challenge posed by MPs and NPs. The global production of plastic has skyrocketed from 1.5 million tons in the 1950s to an astonishing 390.7 million tons in 2021. This pervasive presence of these materials in our environment has spurred scientific inquiry into their potentially harmful effects on living organisms. Studies have revealed that while MPs, with their larger surface area, are capable of absorbing contaminants and pathogens from the surroundings, NPs can easily be transferred through the food chain. As a result, living organisms may ingest them and accumulate them within their bodies. Due to their minuscule size, NPs are particularly difficult to isolate and quantify. Furthermore, exposure to both NPs and MPs has been linked to various adverse health effects in aquatic species, including neurological impairments, disruption of lipid and energy metabolism, and increased susceptibility to cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It is alarming to note that MPs have even been detected in commercial fish, highlighting the severity of this issue. There are also challenges associated with elucidating the toxicological effects of NPs and MPs, which are discussed in detail in this review. In conclusion, plastic pollution is a pressing issue that governments should tackle by ensuring proper implementation of rules and regulations at national and provincial levels to reduce its health risks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marine pollution is becoming ubiquitous in the environment. Observations of pollution on beaches, in the coastal ocean, and in organisms in the Antarctic are becoming distressingly common. Increasing human activity, growing tourism, and an expanding krill fishing industry along the West Antarctic Peninsula all represent potential sources of plastic pollution and other debris (collectively referred to as debris) to the region. However, the sources of these pollutants from point (pollutants released from discrete sources) versus non-point (pollutants from a large area rather than a specific source) sources are poorly understood. We used buoyant simulated particles released in a high-resolution physical ocean model to quantify pollutant loads throughout the region. We considered non-point sources of debris from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Bellingshausen Sea, Weddell Sea, and point source pollution from human activities including tourism, research, and fishing. We also determined possible origins for observed debris based on data from the Southern Ocean Observing System and Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program. Our results indicate that point source pollution released in the coastal Antarctic is more likely to serve as a source for observed debris than non-point sources, and that the dominant source of pollution is region-specific. Penguin colonies in the South Shetland and Elephant Islands had the greatest debris load from point sources whereas loads from non-point sources were greatest around the southernmost colonies. Penguin colonies at Cornwallis Island and Fort Point were exposed to the highest theoretical debris loads. While these results do not include physical processes such as windage and Stokes Drift that are known to impact debris distributions and transport in the coastal ocean, these results provide critical insights to building an effective stratified sampling and monitoring effort to better understand debris distributions, concentrations, and origins throughout the West Antarctic Peninsula. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In an extensive exploration of microplastics within soil environments, our study aims to investigate the presence, spread, and ecological impact of microplastics in soil, focusing on Makassar City, Indonesia. Using a Sinher binocular digital microscope, we visually examined soil samples in Petri dishes, measuring microplastic sizes with Image-J software. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was also employed for additional identification and analysis of polymer compositions. Our research uncovered a widespread presence of microplastics across diverse soil types and land uses, including residential, fishpond, agricultural, landfill, coastal, and bareland areas. The concentration of these microplastics was found to be between 16.6 to 21.9 particles/gram, showing consistency across most land uses, with some variations in coastal areas. We noted a significant variety in microplastic forms, predominantly fragments and films, across the different land uses. A wide range of colors was observed, including blue, green, red, and transparent. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were identified as the predominant polymers. Our study highlights the non-uniform distribution of microplastics in soil, suggesting potential significant impacts on soil organisms and the wider ecosystem. These findings underscore the critical need for more comprehensive research on the ecological implications of microplastics in soil environments. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Abstract: The results of the research of the microplastic accumulation in the floodplain alluvium of the river Volga in the area of Tver are presented Soil samples were taken within the city, upstream and downstream of the river. Samples were processed using a modified method of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Microplastic particles were detected in all samples, the largest amount was found in the area where plastic production and processing enterprises are located. It has been established that films, granules and fragments of plastic particles predominate in all selected samples ranging in size from 1 to 2.5 mm along the largest axis. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

       " Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve a pivotal role in transferring microplastics (MPs) from wastewater to sludge streams, thereby exerting a significant influence on their release into the environment and establishing wastewater and biosolids as vectors for MP transport and delivery. Hence, an accurate understanding of the fate and transport of MPs in WWTPs is vital. Enumeration is commonly used to estimate concentrations of MPs in performance evaluations of treatment processes, and risk assessment also typically involves MP enumeration. However, achieving high accuracy in concentration estimates is challenging due to inherent uncertainty in the analytical workflow to collect and process samples and count MPs. Here, sources of random error in MP enumeration in wastewater and other matrices were investigated using a modeling approach that addresses the sources of error associated with each step of the analysis. In particular, losses are reflected in data analysis rather than merely being measured as a validation step for MP extraction methods. A model for addressing uncertainty in the enumeration of microorganisms in water was adapted to include key assumptions relevant to the enumeration of MPs in wastewater. Critically, analytical recovery, the capacity to successfully enumerate particles considering losses and counting error, may be variable among MPs due to differences in size, shape, and type (differential analytical recovery) in addition to random variability between samples (nonconstant analytical recovery). Accordingly, differential analytical recovery among the categories of MPs was added to the existing model. This model was illustratively applied to estimate MP concentrations from simulated data and quantify uncertainty in the resulting estimates. Increasing the number of replicates, counting categories of MPs separately, and accounting for both differential and nonconstant analytical recovery improved the accuracy of MP enumeration. This work contributes to developing guidelines for analytical procedures quantifying MPs in diverse types of samples and provides a framework for enhanced interpretation of enumeration data, thereby facilitating the collection of more accurate and reliable MP data in environmental studies. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Microplastics have been reported to be present in zooplankton, yet questions persist regarding their fate and dynamics within biota. We selected the commercial mysid shrimp, Mesopodopsis orientalis, as the focal zooplankton for this study due to their crucial role in our study area, the Inner Gulf of Thailand in January 2022. We investigated the presence of microplastics in mysid bodies and fecal pellets, examining both attached microplastics on external body parts and those ingested. In addition, we conducted microplastic feeding experiments, exposing mysids to various treatments of microplastics. The results of the field investigation indicate that mysids exhibited an average of 0.12 ± 0.03 microplastic items/mysid from whole-body samples. The shape, type, and color of microplastics found in mysids were similar to those present in seawater, with blue PET microfibers being the most prevalent. Our observations on live mysids revealed that microplastics were acquired through ingestion and adherence to appendages and exoskeletons. Microplastics were observed in mysid's fecal pellets at 0.09 ± 0.03 items/mysid, while microplastics adhering to the mysid's body and appendages were observed at 0.10 ± 0.04 items/mysid. The sizes of microplastics extracted from preserved mysids ranged from 58 μm to 4669 μm, with median of 507 μm. The laboratory experiments revealed that the presence of microalgae enhanced microplastic ingestion in mysids; microplastics incubated with a cyanobacterium, Oscillatoria sp., and diatom Navicula sp. significantly increased the number of microplastic particles ingested by mysids. This study showed that microplastics can be more ingested in mysids, especially when food items are present. Microplastic fate in these animals may involve expulsion into the environment or adherence, potentially facilitating their transfer up the marine food web. © 2024,\n",
       " Given their pervasiveness in the environment, particularly in aquatic ecosystems, plastics are posing a growing concern worldwide. Many vertebrates and invertebrates in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems exhibit microplastic (MP) uptake and accumulation. Some studies have indicated the fatal impacts of MPs on animals and their possible transfer through food chains. Thus, it is crucial to study MP pollution and its impacts on environment-sensitive and globally threatened animal groups, such as amphibians, which also play an important role in the energy transfer between ecosystems. Unfortunately, research in this field is lacking and sources of organized information are also scarce. Hence, we systematically reviewed published literature on MPs in amphibians to fill the existing knowledge gap. Our review revealed that most of the previous studies have focused on MP bioaccumulation in amphibians, whereas, only a few research highlighted its impacts. We found that more than 80% of the studied species exhibited MP accumulation. MPs were reported to persist in different organs for a long time and get transferred to other trophic levels. They can also exhibit cytotoxic and mutagenic effects and may have fatal impacts. Moreover, they can increase the disease susceptibility of amphibians. Our study concludes the MPs as a potential threat to amphibians and urges increasing the scope and frequency of research on MP pollution and its impacts on this vulnerable animal group. We also provide a generalized method for studying MPs in amphibians with future perspectives and research directions. Our study is significant for extending the knowledge of MPs and their impacts on amphibians and guiding prospective research. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic contamination is a global pervasive issue, extending from coastal areas and open oceans to polar regions and even the deep sea. Microplastic (MP) contamination in hydrothermal vents, which are known for their high biodiversity even under extreme conditions, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present, for the first time, MP pollution in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent at one of the biodiversity hotspots─the Central Indian Ridge. Not only the environment (seawater: 2.08 ± 1.04 MPs/L, surface sediments: 0.57 ± 0.19 MP/g) but also all six major benthic species investigated were polluted by MPs. MPs mainly consisted of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene fragments ≤100 μm and were characterized as being either transparent or white in color. Remarkably, bioaccumulation and even biomagnification of microplastics were observed in the top predators of the ecosystem, such as squat lobsters (14.25 ± 4.65 MPs/individual) and vent crabs (14.00 ± 2.16 MPs/individual), since they contained more MPs than animals at lower trophic levels (e.g., mussels and snails, 1.75-6.00 average MPs/individuals). These findings reveal MP contamination of an ecosystem in a hydrothermal vent, thereby suggesting that their accumulation and magnification can occur in top-level animals, even within remote and extreme environments. © 2024 American Chemical Society,\n",
       " BACKGROUND: Since the 1970s, microplastic contamination has been discovered in various environments. These emerging pollutants threaten water quality and freshwater ecosystems. We aimed to assess microplastic contamination in the Nan River by quantifying their presence, characterising their morphology, and identifying their polymer composition. METHODS: The survey was conducted along the Nan River in northern Thailand, which is divided into three distinct zones based on land use (ie, community areas, agricultural areas, and natural areas). A wide array of samples, including surface water, sediment, and specimens from five aquatic species-Barbonymus altus, Laides hexanema, Kryptopterus cryptopterus, Pomacea canaliculata, and Pseudodon cambodjensis cambodjensis-were collected. The presence of microplastics was analysed via the wet peroxide oxidation process for sample digestion, morphological characteristics were assessed through microscopic examination, and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry was used to identify the polymer composition of the microplastics. FINDINGS: Natural areas had the highest mean concentration of microplastics in surface water (23·67 pcs/L, SD 14·22), whereas community areas had the highest mean concentration in soil sediment (24·67 pcs/g, 15·04). No statistically significant differences in the amounts of microplastics were observed among the various land-use zones. Microplastics were predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish specimens, with varying quantities observed among different aquatic species; B altus had the highest concentration (11·80 pcs/g, 8·98). The primary microplastic shapes identified were filaments (53·99%), fragments (35·58%), and cylindrical forms (10·43%). We identified ten different polymer types, with polypropylene, nylons, and polymethyl methacrylate being the most prevalent among them. INTERPRETATION: Analysing microplastic pollution in this area brings attention to the issues affecting the rivers of Thailand and emphasises ecological risks, particularly microplastic presence in aquatic species. Because of the Nan River's ecological importance, we call for increased research and collaboration to address the increasing threat of microplastic pollution. FUNDING: Naresuan University.

       " In this work, organic chemicals associated with microplastics (MPs) exposed to a coastal anthropogenized environment for up to eight weeks have been screened for, in order to discern the (de)sorption dynamics of chemicals in the marine ecosystem. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pellets were studied since they represent primary MPs used by the plastic industry and a relevant input of MPs into the oceans. To maximize the coverage of chemicals that could be detected, both liquid and gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight (GC-QTOF and LC-QTOF, respectively) were used. In the case of LC-QTOF, an electrospray ionization source was employed, and the compounds were investigated by combining suspect and non-target screening workflows. The GC-QTOF was equipped with an electron ionization source and compounds were screened in raw and derivatized (silylated) extracts by deconvolution and contrast to high- and low-resolution libraries. A total of 50 compounds of multifarious classes were tentatively identified. Among them, melamine and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS) were detected in the original MPs but were rapidly desorbed. Melamine was completely released into the marine environment, while EHS was partly released but a portion remained bound to the MPs. On the other hand, many other chemicals of both anthropogenic (e.g. phenanthrene or benzophenone) and natural origin (e.g. betaine and several fatty acids) accumulated onto MPs over time. Quantification of 12 unequivocally identified chemicals resulted into a total concentration of 810 μg/kg after MPs exposure for 8 weeks. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This review summarizes recent data related to the management of marine plastic litter to promote sustainable development. It discusses the distribution and identification of marine plastic litter, assesses the potential socio-economic and environmental impacts of these pollutants, and explores their recovery strategies, from a circular economy perspective. The main findings indicate that the majority of marine plastic litter originates from land-based sources. Current technologies and approaches for valorizing marine plastic litter include mechanical and chemical recycling, blockchain technologies by providing traceability, verification, efficiency and transparency throughout the recycling process, and public awareness programs and education. The developed policies to prevent marine plastic litter emphasize regulations and initiatives focused toward reducing plastic use and improving plastic waste management. By adopting a holistic and sustainable approach, it is possible to mitigate the environmental impact of marine plastic debris while simultaneously creating economic opportunities. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " In the coastal environment, a large amount of microplastics (MPs) can accumulate in the sediments of seagrass beds. However, the potential impact these pollutants have on seagrasses and associated organisms is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the differences in MPs abundance and composition (i.e., shape, colour and polymer type) in marine sediments collected at different depths (−5 m, −15 m, −20 m) at two sites characterized by the presence of Posidonia oceanica meadows and at one unvegetated site. In the vegetated sites, sediment samples were collected respectively above and below the upper and lower limits of the meadow (−5 m and −20 m), out of the P. oceanica meadow, and in the central portion of the meadow (−15 m). By focusing on the central part of the meadow, we investigated if the structural features (i.e. shoots density and leaf surface) can affect the amount of MPs retained within the underlying sediment and if these, in turn, can affect the associated benthic communities. Results showed that the number of MPs retained by P. oceanica meadows was higher than that found at the unvegetated site, showing also a different composition. In particular, at vegetated sites, we observed that MPs particles were more abundant within the meadow (at – 15 m), compared to the other depths, on unvegetated sediment, with a dominance of transparent fragments of polypropylene (PP). We observed that MPs entrapment by P. oceanica was accentuated by the higher shoots density, while the seagrass leaf surface did not appear to have any effect. Both the abundance and richness of macrofauna associated with P. oceanica rhizomes appear to be negatively influenced by the MPs abundance in the sediment. Overall, this study increases knowledge of the potential risks of MPs accumulation in important coastal habitats such as the Posidonia oceanica meadows. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have been identified as a major potential threat to the biota and human health. Despite the exponential increase in MP research worldwide, few studies have focused on the extensive Amazon biome. To assess research priorities, the present study reviewed and summarized the available scientific knowledge on MPs in the Amazon, in addition to analyzing population and waste-management data, to evaluate potential sources of MPs in the hydrographic system. Poor sanitation conditions are a main source of MPs for the vast hydrographic basin, and, consequently, for the adjacent ocean. Secondary MPs predominated, mostly fibers (96% of debris), composed of polyamide (32%). Mean MP concentrations ranged from 0.34 to 38.3 particles.individual−1 in biota, 5 to 476,000 particles.m−3 in water, and 492.5 to 1.30848 × 107 particles.m−3 in sediment, values in close comparison with those found in areas profoundly affected by anthropogenic pollution. MPs were widespread in a range of Amazonian environments and species, and negative effects are probably occurring at various ecological levels. However, limited research, methodological constraints, flaws and the lack of standardization, combined with the continental dimensions of the Amazon, hampers the collection of the fundamental knowledge needed to reliably evaluate the impacts and implement effective mitigation measures. There is an urgent need to expand scientific data available for the region, improving local research infrastructure, and training and deploying local researchers. © 2024 The Authors,\n",

       " The environmental impact of microplastics is increasingly being recognized, leading to their inclusion as contaminants of emerging concern. Consequently, it is essential to identify and monitor microplastics and their impact on the ecosystem. In this study, a ball miller was employed to process plastic waste, generating microplastics for the optimisation of separation methods. Microplastics of various sizes and shapes were produced and used to spike the sediments for optimisation of the density separation method. The recovered microplastics ranged from 0.74-5 mm, as confirmed by stereomicroscopy. In addition, the types of polymers present in microplastics were confirmed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR). The developed analytical method was employed to study the occurrence of microplastics in river sediments passing through informal settlements after floods. Moreover, the evaluated data confirmed that informal settlements are a major source of microplastics found in the ocean after a flood. Microplastics in river and ocean sediments were predominantly composed of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene with a size range of 0.90-5 mm. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the impacts of informal settlements on the ocean during floods in Africa. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.,\n",
       " The COVID-19 pandemic during 2020–2023 has wrought adverse impacts on coastal and marine environments. This study conducts a comprehensive review of the collateral effects of COVID-19 on these ecosystems through literature review and bibliometric analysis. According to the output and citation analysis of these publications, researchers from the coastal countries in Asia, Europe, and America payed more attentions to this environmental issue than other continents. Specifically, India, China, and USA were the top three countries in the publications, with the proportion of 19.55%, 18.99%, and 12.01%, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly aggravated the plastic and microplastic pollution in coastal and marine environments by explosive production and unproper management of personal protective equipment (PPE). During the pandemic, the estimated mismanaged PPE waste ranged from 16.50 t/yr in Sweden to 250,371.39 t/yr in Indonesia. In addition, the PPE density ranged from 1.13 × 10−5 item/m2 to 2.79 item/m2 in the coastal regions worldwide, showing significant geographical variations. Besides, the emerging contaminants released from PPE into the coastal and marine environments cannot be neglected. The positive influence was that the COVID-19 lockdown worldwide reduced the release of air pollutants (e.g., fine particulate matter, NO2, CO, and SO2) and improved the air quality. The study also analyzed the relationships between sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the publications and revealed the dynamic changes of SDGs in different periods the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, the air was cleaner due to the lockdown, but the coastal and marine contamination of plastic, microplastic, and emerging contaminants got worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Last but not least, the study proposed four strategies to deal with the coastal and marine pollution caused by COVID-19, which were regular marine monitoring, performance of risk assessment, effective regulation of plastic wastes, and close international cooperation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study aims to investigate the influence of wheel configurations on hydrodynamic resistance of an amphibious vessel through experiments and simulations. To evaluate the resistance performance associated with wheel attachments, three configurations were examined: vessel without attachments, with caterpillars, and with both caterpillars and shoe−paddles. A comprehensive series of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for these attachment types, complemented by experimental validations. The Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) model was employed in CFD simulations to capture the free surface movement, and the Dynamic Fluid–Body Interaction (DFBI) model was adopted to represent the two-degree-of-freedom motion of the vessel, specifically trim and sinkage. The total resistance derived from CFD simulations was calculated across a range of Froude numbers (Fns), including the design speed of the target vessel, and validated through model tests conducted in a wave basin equipped with a towing facility. The analysis indicated a general increase in resistance when attachments were added to the amphibious vessel. Remarkably, at the design speed (Fn = 0.27), the total resistance with both caterpillars and shoe−paddles exceeded that of the configuration without any attachments by more than 75.7%. These results provide crucial insights for the preliminary design stage of amphibious vessels, particularly those intended for marine debris collection in hard-to-reach areas. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " The pervasive use of plastic in modern society has led to plastic litter becoming ubiquitous within the ocean. Land-based sources of plastic litter are thought to account for the majority of plastic pollution in the marine environment, with plastic bags, bottles, wrappers, food containers and cutlery among the most common items found. In the marine environment, plastic is a transboundary pollutant, with the potential to cause damage far beyond the political borders from where it originated, making the management of this global pollutant particularly complex. In this study, the risks of land-derived plastic litter (LDPL) to major groups of marine megafauna – seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, elasmobranchs, turtles, sirenians, tuna and billfish – and a selection of productive and biodiverse biogenic habitats – coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass, saltmarsh and kelp beds – were analysed using a Spatial Risk Assessment approach. The approach combines metrics for vulnerability (mechanism of harm for megafauna group or habitat), hazard (plastic abundance) and exposure (distribution of group or habitat). Several potential high-risk zones (HRZs) across the North Atlantic were highlighted, including the Azores, the UK, the French and US Atlantic coasts, and the US Gulf of Mexico. Whilst much of the modelled LDPL driving risk in the UK originated from domestic sources, in other HRZs, such as the Azores archipelago and the US Gulf of Mexico, plastic originated almost exclusively from external (non-domestic) sources. LDPL from Caribbean islands - some of the largest generators of marine plastic pollution in the dataset of river plastic emissions used in the study - was noted as a significant input to HRZs across both sides of the Atlantic. These findings highlight the potential of Spatial Risk Assessment analyses to determine the location of HRZs and understand where plastic debris monitoring and management should be prioritised, enabling more efficient deployment of interventions and mitigation measures. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The assessment of microplastic (MP) pollution in urban areas is essential considering its abundance in freshwater, particularly due to urban wet weather discharge. The precise sources of MPs must be identified to better understand its characteristics. This study examines the relationship between MP pollution in detention basin sediments and land use in the investigated catchments. The study of stormwater management infrastructure, mainly in detention basins, has enabled the quantification of MP abundance in sediments conveyed by stormwater in urban areas. Sediment sampling was conducted in ten detention basins and one combined sewer overflow (CSO) structure in the Lyon metropolitan area, France. These basins correspond to stormwater outlets of representative urban catchment areas. MP extraction involves densimetric separation and organic matter degradation. MPs were then characterized using micro-Fourier infrared spectroscopy and siMPle software. This protocol identified MPs between 50 and 500 μm in the study sites. This study highlights the high abundance in the collected sediment samples, ranging from 2,525 to 1,218,82 MP kg−1 by dry weight sediment. The MPs found have a median size around 115 μm, making them very small MPs that are mainly composed of polypropylene followed by polyethylene and polystyrene or polyethylene terephthalate. The abundance of MPs in sediments is associated with the land use type. Catchments in predominantly industrial and commercial zones were more significantly polluted with MPs compared with those in predominantly agricultural or heterogeneous zones. Finally, statistical analyses revealed links between sedimentary and urban parameters and MPs concentrations. Several recommendations are given for future research, notably concerning the analyzing of stormwater sediments to understand the sources of MP pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The term “Plastisphere” refers to the biofilm layer naturally formed by microorganisms attaching to plastic surfaces. This layer possesses the capability to adsorb persistent organic and inorganic pollutants, particularly trace metals, which are the focus of this research study. Immersion experiments were concurrently conducted in five locations spanning four European countries (France, Ireland, Spain, and Italy) utilising eight distinct polymers. These immersions, repeated every three months over a one-year period, aimed to evaluate the baseline bioaccumulation of 12 trace metals. The study underscores the intricate nature of metal bioaccumulation, influenced by both micro-scale factors (such as polymer composition) and macro-scale factors (including geographical site and seasonal variations). Villefranche Bay in France exhibited the lowest metals bioaccumulation, whereas Naples in Italy emerged as the site where bioaccumulation was often the highest for the considered metals. Environmental risk assessment was also conducted in the study. The lightweight nature of certain plastics allows them to be transported across significant distances in the ocean. Consequently, evaluating trace metal concentrations in the plastisphere is imperative for assessing potential environmental repercussions that plastics, along with their associated biota, may exert even in locations distant from their point of emission. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Abstract: A quantitative assessment of microplastic (MP) content has been conducted in the gastrointestinal tract of perch, roach, and bream in Lake Kubenskое in Vologda oblast. MPs are detected in 60% of bream specimens and 43% of perch specimens. Plastic microparticles are not found in the gastrointestinal tract of the roach. It is found that the average number of MP particles is 1.6 ± 0.4 items per bream individual and 4.2 ± 1.4 items of MP per perch individual. MPs in the gastrointestinal tract of fish are mainly fibers, with a small proportion of fragments and films. No significant differences (р > 0.05) in the content of MPs in the gastrointestinal tract of benthivorous (bream) and euryphagous (perch) fish are found. These data are the first evidence of the presence of MPs in fish in the water bodies of Vologda oblast. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

       " Global food security, particularly in South Asia and low-income coastal regions like India, relies on seafood consumption, both fresh and dried. Seafood, encompassing small pelagic fish, dried varieties, and salt-cured fish, absorbs xenobiotics like micro/nanoplastics and their associated contaminants during processing. This occurs due to factors such as processing conditions, the status of fish muscle biochemistry, and the additives used, presenting largely unexplored health risks that have received minimal study attention. This study investigates the impact of salting on microplastics (MPs) contamination in cured fish, exploring the intricate relationship between salting, muscle biochemistry, and MPs under controlled conditions. Commercial solar salt used for curing contained an average of 40.72 ± 5.97 MPs/g. Microplastic abundance in cured fish decreased significantly, from 65.7 ± 6 to 3.36 ± 1.5 MPs items/g, with a lower salt-to-fish ratio of 1:10. Characteristics of MPs such as morphotype, size, colour and polymer type in both cured fish and curing salt exhibited similar trends. Protein content and MPs showed a strong negative correlation, while the lipid content correlation with MPs presence was weak. Various MPs indices such as contamination factor, load index and polymer induced risk index emphasized salt's significant role in enhancing contamination in cured fish, posing safety risks to consumers. Given the limited number of studies conducted on comprehending the uptake of microplastics in processed seafood, a critical aspect of food safety, the present study aims to illuminate the intricate interplay between fish biochemistry and microplastic characteristics. Additionally, it explores the role of salt in this dynamic, highlighting implications for both food safety and human health. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Biodegradable polymers have been proposed as an alternative to conventional plastics to mitigate the impact of marine litter, but the research investigating their toxicity is still in its infancy. This study evaluates the potential ecotoxicological effects of both virgin and marine-incubated microparticles (MPs), at environmentally relevant concentration (0.1 mg/l), made of different biodegradable polymers (Polycaprolactone, Mater-Bi, cellulose) and conventional polymers (Polyethylene) on Mytilus galloprovincialis by using transcriptomics. This approach is increasingly being used to assess the effects of pollutants on organisms, obtaining data on numerous biological pathways simultaneously. Whole hepatopancreas de novo transcriptome sequencing was performed, individuating 972 genes differentially expressed across experimental groups compared to the control. Through the comparative transcriptomic profiling emerges that the preponderant effect is attributable to the marine incubation of MPs, especially for incubated polycaprolactone (731 DEGs). Mater-Bi and cellulose alter the smallest number of genes and biological processes in the mussel hepatopancreas. All microparticles, regardless of their polymeric composition, dysregulated innate immunity, and fatty acid metabolism biological processes. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the interactions of MPs with the environmental factors in the marine ecosystem when performing ecotoxicological evaluations. The results obtained contribute to fill current knowledge gaps regarding the potential environmental impacts of biodegradable polymers. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics pose a substantial threat to our environment. Given China's large population and rapid economic growth, it is urgent to estimate the annual emissions of microplastics into its marine environment. The microplastics show a significant variation in their source emissions as well as in their physical and chemical properties, leading to differences in their transport and fate in aquatic environments. To account for these variations, we developed a process-oriented model that considers microplastics from different sources and the inter-provincial variation in their retention rate to assess annual microplastic emissions into the China seas. On a national scale, of the microplastics emitted, 36.05 % are from household laundry activities, 27.26 % are from the wear and tear of vehicle tires, and 24.04 % are from the abrasion of plastic household items. After emission, 60.21 % are removed by wastewater treatment plants. The overall proportion of microplastics that end up in the marine environment highly depends on the specific riverine retention rate of microplastics from vehicle tires. Including the high settling rate of these microplastics, this proportion drops from 9.96 % to 3.29 %, rendering vehicle tires a minor contributor to microplastic emissions into the China seas compared to other sources. Moreover, when using the density-dependent approach and considering the east/west dimension of each province, the microplastic emissions from vehicle tires into the China seas decrease from 71 % to 5.27 %. This underscores the urgent need for global and regional models to account for the detailed riverine transport process of microplastics from vehicle tires in order to enhance the accuracy of their emission estimates into coastal waters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Pollution of plastic waste in aquatic ecosystems in Ghana is of significant concern with potential adverse effects on food safety and ecosystem function. This study examined the abundance and distribution of microplastics (MPs) in freshwater biota samples namely: the African river prawn (Macrobrachium vollenhovenii), the Volta clam (Galatea paradoxa), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and sediment from the Volta Lake. Both biota and sediment samples were subjected to microscopic identification and FTIR analysis. In biota samples, the highest mean microplastic abundance of 4.7 ± 2.1 items per individual was found in the prawn, while the Nile tilapia recorded the least (2.8 ± 0.6 items per individual). A total of 398 microplastic particles were observed in sediment samples from the Volta Lake. Microfibers were the major plastic shapes identified in biota and sediment samples. We examined the relationship between microplastic abundance, biota size, and sediment properties. Despite the lack of statistical significance, microplastic shape, size, and polymer composition in assessed organisms mirrored those in the benthic sediment. Polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, and polystyrene were the four dominant polymer types identified in the organisms and sediments. Although the estimated human exposure was relatively low compared with studies from other regions of the world, the presence of microplastics raises concern for the safety of fisheries products consumed by the general populace in the country. This research is essential for developing effective mitigation measures and tackling the wider effects of microplastic contamination on Ghana's freshwater ecosystems, particularly the Volta Lake. © 2024,\n",
       " Sediments act as sinks of microplastics (MPs) derived from terrestrial ecosystems. However, the fate and transport of MPs at the zone of sediment-overlying water in reservoir environment are poorly understood. Here, the MPs distribution patterns in surface sediments of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and dominant mechanisms responsible for the sinking of MPs at the zone of sediment-overlying water were comprehensively investigated. The predominant occurrence of small microplastics (<300 µm, SMPs) in surface sediments of the TGR was found, with buoyant polyethene (PE) was dominant polymer types. Interestingly, the high abundance of SMPs in sediments correlated well with the Ca2+/Mg2+ in overlying water, suggesting that divalent cations in overlying water may enhance the preferential deposition of SMPs. Simulation sinking experiments under the presence of Microcystis aeruginosa and two divalent cations using different-sized PE MPs demonstrated that the greater deposition of SMPs was mainly the result of the formation of biogenic calcite on the surface of MPs rather than magnesium minerals, which provides stronger ballasting effects for SMPs than for large MPs. This study first highlights that the impact of biomineralization on preferential sinking of SMPs and enhances the understanding of the transport behaviour of MPs in aquatic environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Fly-ash particles formed during industrial fossil-fuel combustion show a globally observed rapid increase in concentration within natural archives post-1950 and have been proposed as a marker for the Anthropocene Epoch. Here, we present the first record of fly-ash particles incorporated into coral skeletons. Particles are present in Mediterranean corals between CE 1957 and 1992 at concentrations of 8–30 g−1 coral, mirroring the period of increased industrial activity in the area, and corroborating with spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) records globally. The findings have important implications for the use of SCPs as markers in natural archives. With the exception of microplastics, this is the first evidence of particulate contamination in corals collected from natural environments. Further research is needed to understand incorporation pathways into coral skeletons, any subsequent ecotoxicological impact of contaminants, and the influence on overall coral health globally. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG), significantly impacts marine ecosystems and biodiversity by incidental capture known as ghost fishing. Such impacts were quantified during the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries' annual ALDFG cleanup operation in September 2023 by examining the characteristics of retrieved ALDFG and recording the taxonomically sorted catch abundance and biomass. A total of 307 specimens equaling 382 kg of biomass were caught in the recovered gillnets and king crab pots. Gillnets exhibited a 27.3 % greater catch abundance and 50.3 % higher biomass per ALDFG unit mass compared to king crab pots. Margalef, Menhinick, Simpson, Shannon, and Pielou diversity indices showed a more pronounced impact on species richness and biodiversity associated with recovered gillnets. This study introduces an approach to assess the impact of ghost fishing on ecosystems and biodiversity through ALDFG retrieval operations, instrumental in developing estimates of the total ghost fishing capture by ALDFG. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Despite the significant negative impact of marine pollution on the ecosystem and humans, its automated detection and tracking from the broadly available satellite data is still a major challenge. In particular, most research and development efforts focus on one specific pollutant implementing, in most cases, binary classification tasks, e.g., detect Plastics or no Plastics, or target a limited number of classes, such as Oil Spill, Look-alikes and Water. Moreover, most developed algorithms tend to operate successfully only locally, failing to scale and generalize adequately towards operational deployments. Our aim is to address these challenges by introducing a holistic approach towards marine pollutant detection using remote sensing. We argue that constructing such operational solutions requires detectors trained and tested against different types of pollutants, various sea surface features and water-related thematic classes. We offer such a Marine Debris and Oil Spill (MADOS) dataset, composed of high-resolution multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) data, consisting of 174 scenes captured between 2015 and 2022, with approximately 1.5 M annotated pixels, which are globally distributed and collected under various weather conditions. Moreover, we propose a novel Deep Learning (DL) framework named MariNeXt, based on recent state-of-the-art architectural advancements for semantic segmentation, which outperforms all baselines by at least 12 % in F1 and mIoU metrics. The extensive quantitative and qualitative validation justifies our choices and demonstrates the high potential of the proposed approach. We further discuss the underlying discrimination challenges among the competing thematic classes.

       " Oceanic islands are exposed to plastic debris that has accumulated in the open ocean, particularly in the subtropical gyres. This study investigates the abundance and typology of microplastics (from 0.1 to 5 mm) on 19 sandy beaches spread across 8 oceanic islands of the Azores archipelago. Between January and April 2016, a total of 341 particles retrieved from all beaches, were identified as microplastics. The highest concentration (50.19 ± 21.93 particles kg−1 dw) was found in Terceira Island. Beach morphology and grain size were important factors explaining microplastic concentration. Fibres were the most dominant morphology recovered (80.9 %), followed by fragments (12.3 %). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that 41 % of the fibres consisted of polyester and 60 % of the fragments were polyethylene. This research underlines the widespread contamination of microplastics in oceanic islands of the Atlantic Ocean. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (5 mm - 1 μm) have become one of the major pollutants in the environment. Numerous studies have shown that microplastics can have negative impacts on aquatic organisms, affecting their liver function levels. However, the extent of these effects and their potential toxicological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, a meta-analysis and systematic review were conducted to assess the effects of microplastics on fish liver function and summarize the potential toxicological mechanisms of microplastic-induced liver toxicity. The meta-analysis results indicate that compared to the control group, exposure to microplastics significantly affects fish liver indicators: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p < 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p < 0.001), total protein (TP) (p < 0.001), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), including oxidative stress indicators: superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p < 0.001), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (p < 0.001), glutathione (GSH) (p < 0.001), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.001) in fish liver. For fish living in different environments, the potential toxicological mechanisms of microplastics exposure on fish liver may exhibit some differences. For freshwater fish, the mechanism may be that microplastics exposure causes overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fish hepatocyte mitochondria. ROS promotes the expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and activates downstream molecules myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) of the TLR2 signaling pathway, leading to phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. This leads to the release of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress and inflammation in fish liver. In addition, for seawater fish, the mechanism may be that microplastics exposure can cause damage or death of fish hepatocytes, leading to continuous pathological changes, inflammation, lipid and energy metabolism disorders, thereby causing significant changes in liver function indexes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastics have widespread applications for human use, but their disposal poses a significant threat to living organisms and these plastics end up in the marine environment. They will be fragmented into small pieces as a result of ultraviolet exposure, climatic changes, and temperature changes; Microplastics (MPs) are plastics that are less than 5 mm in size. The level of MP (Microplastic) pollution in commercially harvested fish from different habitant in Vellore, India is currently unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the presence and characteristics of ingested or inhaled MPs in marine and freshwater fishes highly consumed by the local population. Fish gills and gastrointestinal tracts were aseptically dissected and digested (30% hydrogen peroxide), then filtered and examined under a microscope for the presence of MPs. Further analysis was performed on the samples using Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDAX). Of the samples analysed, a total of 875 MPs were recovered from 32 fishes, with 478 from marine fishes and 397 from freshwater fishes. The most common colours of the MPs were blue and black, while stereo microscopy analysis revealed that the majority of MPs were fibers (91%), followed by fragments (8%) and a small number of films. The ATR-FTIR analysis identified polyvinyl alcohol (39.76%), polyethylene (16.51%), methylcellulose (12.84%) and styrene (9.07%), as the predominant types of MPs in the fish samples. This study highlights the significant impact of MP pollution on marine ecosystems. The research provides insight into the nature and extent of MPs in fish from both marine and freshwater habitats, with an aim for policies and interventions aimed to reduce plastic pollution in the locality. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The adverse environmental impacts on mangrove ecosystems due to anthropogenic marine debris contamination have attracted public attention not only in Sri Lanka but worldwide. Therefore, quantification of marine debris in sensitive ecosystems like mangroves is critical to assess the impacts on ecosystem vitality and services. We conducted this study to assess the abundance and density of marine debris in Negombo lagoon, Western Province, Sri Lanka. We selected two sites (n = 2) using the purposive sampling technique. Marine debris cover and concentration were calculated to explore the extent of pollution from marine debris. The findings revealed that 9.83 ± 1.05 % of the substrate of the mangrove ecosystem is covered by debris. Nine types of marine debris were recorded, and a higher abundance belonged to single-use plastic items. A significantly higher debris cover was found in Kadolkele (18.80 ± 1.74 %, n = 120) than in Molekadolwetiya (0.85 ± 0.03 %, n = 120) (One-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). The study indicated that the mangroves in lagoon are highly polluted with marine debris and act as “litter catchers.” Correlation coefficient analysis was used to find the impact of debris cover on physical damage to roots, seedlings, and undergrowth vegetation. Correlation analysis revealed that physical damage to seedlings and branches/barks have a positive correlation with debris cover. To conserve these valuable coastal habitats in Negombo lagoon, it is recommended to take remedial measures to reduce arriving debris loads and to remove the debris present in mangroves. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " An important number of studies have evaluated the presence of microplastics, particles with a size below 5 mm, in aquatic organisms. Studies have shown that these fragments are widely present in the marine environment, but research on the estuarine ecosystem is still scarce. In this study, two different approaches were used to evaluate the presence and ingestion of plastic particles in the ragworm Hediste diversicolor: a field study for the environmental assessment and a laboratory experiment in controlled condition. For the environmental evaluation, ingestion of microplastics was evaluated in the ragworm H. diversicolor sampled from the mudflats of the Seine estuary (France) during March and June 2017 and 2018, on two locations: S1 and S2, both characterized by high anthropogenic pressures, and for S2 a more influential hydrodynamic component. Ingestion of microplastics was measured in ragworms tissues and in gut content (sediment) after depuration. The number of particles as well as their size, shape and color were reported and compared between sampling period and locations. Results showed the presence of a low number of particles in both worms and gut content. In gut content, 45.6% and 87.58% of samples from site S1 and S2 respectively contained plastic like particles. In worms, 41.7% (S1) and 75.8% (S2) of analysed samples contained plastic like items. The lowest mean number of particles was 0.21 ± 0.31 (S1 in June 2017) in worms’ tissues, but 0.80 ± 0.90 (S1 in June 2017) in the gut content and the highest was 1.47 ± 1.41 (S2 in April 2017) while the highest number was 2.55 ± 2.06 (S2 in June 2017) in worms and gut content respectively. The majority of suspected microplastics observed were fibers (66%) and fragments (27%), but films (3.7%) foam (2.1%), and granules (0.2%) were also identified. In addition, the most polymer type observed by Raman spectroscopy was polypropylene. Furthermore, a preliminary study of the ingestion and egestion of fluorescent polyethylene (PE) microbeads in the digestive tract of ragworms was conducted after exposure through water, during 1h at 1.2 × 106 MP/mL. Results showed a rapid turnover of PE microbeads throughout the digestive tract of worms especially after exposure through water. This study revealed that microplastics are ingested by the ragworm H. diversicolor but do not seem to bioaccumulate. More research is needed to measure potential chronic effects of microplastics on physiological parameters of H. diversicolor and potential trophic transfer of microplastics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is becoming a continuously growing environmental concern, while bivalve mollusks are particularly vulnerable due to their sessile habits and feeding through water filtration processes. Microplastic incidence in soft tissues of the clam Amarilladesma mactroides was assessed along unconsolidated substrates distributed in extensive coastal regions of southern Brazil. Influence of urbanization levels, distance to rivers and local hydrodynamics on microplastic accumulation by the clam was tested. The average concentration of microplastics was high (3.09 ± 2.11 particles.g−1), considering 16 sampled sites. Particles were mainly composed by polyamide, polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, while were mainly smaller, fibrous and colorless. High urbanization and closer proximity to rivers insured higher contamination, which is a trend observed globally. No influence of coastal hydrodynamics was seen. Considering obtained findings, A. mactroides presents good potential to be used as a valuable tool to assess microplastic contamination in unconsolidated substrates of beach areas. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Water pollution is an environmental concern especially due to microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) that received significant consideration for small-sized plastic particle pollution from the soil, dust, marine environment, and drinking water. MPs/NPs, with a large surface area and fine particle sizes, have strong adsorption and substantial transfer for several pollutants. These particles are stable in water bodies and have been identified in the media to possess potential respiratory and oral alignment sources. Therefore, efficacy and feasible techniques for detecting and removing/degradation of MPs/NPs from the environment are imperative. Various conventional and non-conventional methods have been used to eliminate plastic particles; however, these technologies are inefficient due to coagulant types, degradation resistance, and occupying a large space. This study reviewed the types, properties, and occurrence of MPs and NPs. The various technological methods for detecting MPs and NPs and their effects on human health are discussed. The new integrated approaches for removing MPs and NPs, and the challenges currently facing MP and NP remediation in the environment were also put forward. This review will not only help to understand the removal of MPs and NPs from the environment but also provide insight into the removal of plastic particles during water treatment and the thermal pyrolysis process of screened waste plastics into fuel oil. Besides synthesized liquid fuel, adequate information on converting non-condensable pyrolysis gas as byproducts for carbon materials like multi-walled carbon nanotubes is proposed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MP) can be detected in all environmental systems. Marine and terrestrial aquatic systems, especially the transported suspended solids, have often been the focus of scientific investigations in the past. Sediments of aquatic river systems, on the other hand, were often ignored due to the time-consuming sample preparation and analysis procedures. Spectroscopic measurement methods counting particle numbers are hardly suitable as detection methods, because there are plenty of natural particles next to a small number of MP particles. Integral methods, such as thermoanalytical methods are determining the particle mass independently of the inorganic components. In this study, a workflow for sample preparation via density separation and subsequent analysis by thermal extraction desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is presented, which leads to representative and homogeneous samples and allows fast and robust MP mass content measurements suitable for routine analysis. Polymers were identified and quantified in all samples. Polyethylene and styrene-butadiene rubber are the dominant polymers, besides polypropylene and polystyrene. Overall, total polymer masses between 1.18 and 337.0 µg/g could be determined. Highest MP concentrations in riverbed sediment are found in sites characterized by low flow velocities in harbors and reservoirs, while MP concentrations in sandy/gravelly bed sediments with higher flow velocities are small. © 2023 The Authors.

       " This paper provides a detailed description of the findings and methodology related to the monitoring of microplastics in three lakes and one river of the Akmola Region in Kazakhstan. The concentration of microplastic particles and the analysis of water and sediment quality of the Yesil River and Kopa, Zerendinskoye, and Borovoe lakes have been analyzed. A total of 64 water samples were collected across the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, with subsequent analysis revealing a seasonal increase in microplastic concentrations. The average microplastic content ranged from 1.2 × 10−1 particles/dm3 in spring to 4.5 × 10−1 particles/dm3 in autumn. Lakes exhibited higher concentrations compared to the Yesil River. Correlation analysis highlighted a connection between microplastic content and turbidity, particularly notable during the spring season. Analysis of sediments revealed a decrease in microplastic concentrations from the coastal zone toward open waters sediments. Microplastic fibers were predominant in sediments (69.6%), followed by fragments (19.1%), films (7.4%), and granules (3.9%). Larger particles (>500 µm) were found in beach sediments, constituting an average of 40.5% of the total plastics found. This study contributes valuable insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and management strategies to address this environmental concern. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge to public health, but human-caused environmental changes have not been widely recognized as its drivers. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between environmental degradation and antibiotic resistance, demonstrating that the former can potentially fuel the latter with significant public health outcomes. We describe that (i) global warming favors horizontal gene transfer, bacterial infections, the spread of drug-resistant pathogens due to water scarcity, and the release of resistance genes with wastewater; (ii) pesticide and metal pollution act as co-selectors of antibiotic resistance mechanisms; (iii) microplastics create conditions promoting and spreading antibiotic resistance and resistant bacteria; (iv) changes in land use, deforestation, and environmental pollution reduce microbial diversity, a natural barrier to antibiotic resistance spread. We argue that management of antibiotic resistance must integrate environmental goals, including mitigation of further increases in the Earth's surface temperature, better qualitative and quantitative protection of water resources, strengthening of sewage infrastructure and improving wastewater treatment, counteracting the microbial diversity loss, reduction of pesticide and metal emissions, and plastic use, and improving waste recycling. These actions should be accompanied by restricting antibiotic use only to clinically justified situations, developing novel treatments, and promoting prophylaxis. It is pivotal for health authorities and the medical community to adopt the protection of environmental quality as a part of public health measures, also in the context of antibiotic resistance management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The study aimed to obtain environmentally relevant microfibers (MFs) from polyester fabric and assess their impact on the oyster Crassostrea gasar. MFs were obtained by grinding the fabric, and their accumulation in oysters gills and digestive glands was analyzed after exposure to 0.5 mg/L for 2 and 24 h. Additionally, a 48 h depuration was conducted on the oysters exposed for 24 h. Sublethal effects were assessed in oysters exposed for 24 h and depurated for 48 h, using biomarkers like Catalase (CAT), Glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), along with histological analyses. Polyester fabric grinding produced significant MFs (average length: 570 μm) with degraded surface and increased malleability. Oysters showed increased MF accumulation in digestive glands post-exposure, with no impact on antioxidant enzymes. Depuration decreased MFs accumulation. Histological analysis revealed accumulation in the stomach and brown cells, possibly indicating inflammation. This raises concerns about MFs bioaccumulation in marine organisms, impacting the food chain and safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Marine microorganisms have been reported to degrade microplastics. However, the degradation mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, a bacterium Roseibium aggregatum ZY-1 was isolated from seawater, which can degrade poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT). The PBAT-PLA(polylactic acid, PLA) films, before and after degradation, were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), the weight loss rate and water contact angle were measured. The results indicate that ZY-1 colonized on PBAT-PLA film, changed the functional groups and decreased water contact angle of PBAT-PLA film. Moreover, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis reveales that PBAT was degraded into its oligomers (TB, BTB) and monomers (T, A) during 10 days, and adipic acid (A) could be used as a sole carbon source. The whole genome sequencing analyses illustrate the mechanisms and enzymes such as PETase, carboxylesterases, arylesterase (PpEst) and genes like pobA, pcaBCDFGHIJKT, dcaAEIJK, paaGHJ involved in PBAT degradation. Therefore, the R. aggregatum ZY-1 will be a promising candidate of PBAT degradation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " We examined the presence of microplastics in blue mussels Mytilus spp. from the intertidal zone of western Spitsbergen in Arctic Svalbard. The optical microscopy technique detected a total of 148 microplastics, with the highest concentration per mussel being 24 particles. Microplastics were found in 84% of the examined mussels. The microplastics ranged in size from <0.5 mm to 5 mm and consisted of fibers (83%), fragments (13%), plates (3%), and spherules (1%). The micro-Raman spectroscopy technique revealed four different types of polymers: polyethylene (67%), nylon-12 (17%), low-density polyethylene (11%), and polypropylene (5%). Our research shows that Arctic coastal waters are polluted with microplastics notwithstanding their remoteness. These findings suggest that microplastic contamination may harm marine life and coastal ecosystems and require further research into long-term environmental effects. We also indicate that intertidal mussels may be beneficial for monitoring microplastics because they can be collected without involving diving. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics are a complex mix of chemicals containing polymers and certain plastic additives such as bisphenols and phthalates. These particles are porous materials that can also sorb contaminants from their surroundings, and leach chemicals from the particle under certain circumstances. Aquatic animals can ingest microplastic particles, which mostly bioaccumulate in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. In terms of dietary exposure, small animals consumed whole such as mussels, contribute more to the dietary intake of microplastic particles. Plastic additives and contaminants are not chemically bound to the polymers, and certain processing methods or cooking processes result in the release of these chemicals that leach from the plastic particles, leaving them more available for absorption when ingested. Analytical methods are crucial for a better understanding of the occurrence of plastic additives and contaminants in aquatic products, and to know certain circumstances and treatments that influence human exposure. This study uses an MSPD-HPLC methodology for the simultaneous determination of 9 analytes (BPA, BPF, BPS, DEP, DBP, DEHP, DDD, DDT, and DDE) analyzing, for the first time, the occurrence of these chemicals in raw, steamed and canned mussels of two different harvesting areas (Atlantic and the Mediterranean), becoming one of the most efficient methodologies for determining the presence of these analytes in very complex food matrices, able to define the changes in cooking and processing activities. The results showed that the heat and pressure treatment could influence the migration of plastic additives from microplastic particles present in mussels to the cooking liquids. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Monitoring microplastics (MPs) in the marine environment is an ongoing process, and our understanding of their impact on marine organisms is limited. The present study evaluates the effects of ingested MPs on the marine MP pollution bioindicator fish species Mullus surmuletus. The study follows a three-fold approach to assess the impact of MPs on marine organisms by investigating: 1) the ingestion of MPs, 2) the bioaccumulation of phthalate compounds as plastic additives, and 3) the evaluation of toxicological biochemical and cellular biomarkers. Striped red mullets were sampled in the marine protected area (MPA) of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos and coastal sites with high touristic pressure in Zakynthos Island in the Ionian Sea, Greece. Fewer ingested MPs and lower phthalate concentrations were found in fish inside the MPA compared to those sampled outside the marine park. However, no relationship was found between either phthalate concentrations or biomarker levels with the ingested MPs in the red striped mullets. Biomarker levels were influenced by season and site, but no effect could be attributed to the ingested MPs. The lack of association of biomarker responses and plasticizer bioaccumulation to MP ingestion can be explained by the low number of ingested MPs in the fish from Zakynthos coastal area as MP abundance ranged from 0.15 to 0.55 items per individual fish. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) were analyzed in seven shrimp species Tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), Red tiger shrimp (Caridina cantonensis), Indian shrimp (Penaeus indicus), Red shrimp (Metapenaeus dobsoni), White shrimp (Penaeus merguiensis), Brown shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros), and Roshna shrimp (Palaemon styliferus) collected from the Bay of Bengal. The abundance and characteristics of MPs were assessed in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which certainly translocated to the muscle of shrimp species. The highest MP abundance was found in C. cantonensis with 7.2 items/individual (25.3 items/g in the GIT and 6.3 items/g in muscle). The prominent types of MPs in shrimp samples were fibers (30 %) and fragments (29 %). The ingestion rate of MPs of black and transparent color was comparatively higher, with 64 % of the ingested MPs were < 100 μm. The primary polymer types detected based on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis were Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polypropylene (PP), and Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA). Results from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed rough surface textures and adhered particles on the MPs isolated from shrimps. The margin of exposure for females was 71.42, and for males, it was 80.64, indicating that women in Bangladesh are more likely to be exposed to MPs and face a higher risk than men. Sensitivity analysis revealed that MPs particle size was the most sensitive parameter. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of MP ingestion, human exposure, and contamination in shrimps of Bangladesh, which can help future monitoring efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Water and soft drink bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sink at sea unless they contain trapped air, whereas their lids are made from polymers that float and can drift long distances. We sampled loose lids and bottles at 21 South African beaches to compare their origins. The proportions of foreign-made bottles and lids were correlated, and increased away from urban centres, indicating that much land-based litter strands close to source areas. Over 80 % of foreign-made drink bottles and 90 % of lids came from Asia, but most bottles were manufactured in China, Malaysia-Singapore and the UAE, and were dumped from ships. By comparison, most loose lids were in poor condition after being carried across the Indian Ocean from Indonesia by the South Equatorial Current. Reducing PET drink bottles at sea requires enforcement of regulations banning dumping at sea, whereas reducing their lids requires better control of littering in source countries. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Inappropriate disposal of plastic wastes and their durability in nature cause uncontrolled accumulation of plastic in land/marine ecosystems, also causing destructive effects by bioaccumulating along the food chain. Microplastics may cause chronic inflammation in relation to their permanent structures, especially through oxidative stress and cytotoxic cellular damage, which could increase the risk of cancer development. The accumulation of microplastics in the liver is a major concern, and therefore, the identification of the mechanisms of their hepatotoxic effects is of great importance. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a widely used thermoplastic. It has been determined that PMMA disrupts lipid metabolism in the liver in various aquatic organisms and causes reproductive and developmental toxicity. PMMA-induced hepatotoxic effects in humans have not yet been clarified. In our study, the toxic effects of PMMA (in the range of 3–10 μm) on the human liver were investigated using the HepG2/THP-1 macrophage co-culture model, which is a sensitive immune-mediated liver injury model. Cellular uptake of micro-sized PMMA in the cells was done by transmission electron microscopy. Determination of its effects on cell viability and inflammatory response, oxidative stress, along with gene and protein expression levels that play a role in the mechanism pathways underlying the effects were investigated. The results concluded that inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions in lipid metabolism should be the focus of attention as important underlying causes of PMMA-induced hepatotoxicity. Our study, which points out the potential adverse effects of microplastics on human health, supports the literature information on the subject. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The present study investigated the contamination of oysters farmed in Amazonian estuaries by microplastics (MPs). A total of 120 adult oysters (Crassostrea gasar) were collected from four sites along the Mangrove Coast of Pará/Brazil: S1, S2, S3 and S4, with 30 oyster for each. Overall, 58.33 % of the oyster samples contained microplastics, with mean concentrations of 0.23 MPs/g and 1.9 MPs/ind. The concentration of microplastics varied among the four sites, where S1 and S3 had the highest values while S4 had the lowest. PA fibers were the majority of particles (91 %), followed by PS fragments (9 %). The hepatopancreas and the gonad concentrated more microplastics than the rest of the body. As an important species for aquaculture in Amazon, we recommend additional regulation to reduce human exposure to microplastics, such as the installation of depuration facilities and constant monitoring of the contamination of oysters from farms in the region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Pollution with anthropogenic waste, particularly persistent plastic, has now reached every remote corner of the world. The French Atlantic coast, given its extensive coastline, is particularly affected. To gain an overview of current plastic pollution, this study examined a stretch of 250 (Formula presented.) (Formula presented.) along the Silver Coast of France. Sampling was conducted at a total of 14 beach sections, each with five sampling sites in a transect. At each collection site, a square of 0.25 m2 was marked. The top 5 (Formula presented.) (Formula presented.) of beach sediment was collected and sieved on-site using an analysis sieve (mesh size 1 (Formula presented.) (Formula presented.)), resulting in a total of approximately 0.8 (Formula presented.) of sediment, corresponding to a total weight of 1300 (Formula presented.) (Formula presented.) of examined beach sediment. A total of 1972 plastic particles were extracted and analysed using infrared spectroscopy, corresponding to (Formula presented.) particles kg−1 of beach sediment. Pellets (885 particles), polyethylene as the polymer type (1349 particles), and particles in the size range of microplastics (943 particles) were most frequently found. The significant pollution by pellets suggests that the spread of plastic waste is not primarily attributable to tourism (in February/March 2023). The substantial accumulation of meso- and macro-waste (with 863 and 166 particles) also indicates that research focusing on microplastics should be expanded to include these size categories, as microplastics can develop from them over time. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Transport of microplastics (MPs) in coastal zones is influenced not only by their own characteristics, but also by the hydrodynamic conditions and coastal environment. In this article, we first summarized the source, distribution and abundance of MPs in coastal zones around the world through the induction of in-situ observation literature, and then comprehensively reviewed the different transports of MPs in coastal zones, including sedimentation, vertical mixing, resuspension, drift and biofouling. Afterwards, we conducted a comparative analysis of relevant experimental literature, and found that the current experimental research on microplastic transport mainly focused on the settling velocity under static water and the transport distribution under dynamic water. Based on the relevant literature on numerical simulation of microplastic transport in coastal zones, it was also found that the Euler-Lagrange method is the most widely used. The main influencing factor in the Euler method is hydrodynamic, while the Lagrange method and Euler-Lagrange method is hydrodynamic and microplastic particle characteristics. Tides in hydrodynamics are mentioned the most frequently, and the role of turbulence in almost all the literature. The density of MPs is the most influencing factor on transport results, followed by size, while shape is only studied in small-scale models. Some literature has also found that the influence of biofilms is mainly reflected in the changes in the density and size of MPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The exponential increase in plastic production coupled with variable global waste management system efficiencies has resulted in large amounts of plastic waste entering the ocean every year. Although we know millions of tonnes of plastic have entered the oceans, we do not yet understand the patterns of its accumulation across space nor the drivers of these patterns. The deep ocean is expected to be a resting place, or reservoir, for most plastic pollution. Here, we conducted a rigorous, systematic review of previously published datasets to synthesize our understanding of macroplastic pollution (>5 mm) on the ocean floor. Using extracted data, we built predictive additive models to estimate the amount and distribution of plastic on the ocean floor. We built two models: one using data from remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and another using data from bottom trawls. Using the model built with ROV data, which was better-constrained, we estimate that 3 to 11 million metric tonnes (MMT) of plastic pollution resides on the ocean floor as of 2020. This is of similar magnitude to annual inputs from land and one to two orders of magnitude greater than what is predicted to be floating on the ocean surface. To improve future estimates and our understanding of global patterns, we provide recommendations for ocean floor monitoring of plastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics are widely found in rivers and their sediments, which will cause harm to the water ecological environment. The Wei River is a first-class tributary of the Yellow River, the fifth largest river in the world, and has vulnerable ecological environment and most sediment in the world. However, understanding how anthropogenic activities and environmental factors affect the microplastics distribution in this river is not clear. Based on this, the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the Wei River were investigated. The abundance of microplastics ranged from 1033 to 8333 items/m3 and from 120 to 840 items/kg in the water and in the sediment, respectively. Fibers and fragments were the main shapes of Wei River, microplastics less than 500 μm were the main sizes, and black and white/transparent were the main colors. In Wei River, the abundance of microplastics in urban areas was higher than that in agricultural areas and mountainous areas. Furthermore, the correlation analysis revealed that microplastic abundance in the water was related to anthropogenic activities (population density, per capita GDP and distance) and environmental factors (water temperature, NH3-N, ORP), while in the sediments was correlated with anthropogenic activities (per capita GDP) and environmental factors (water temperature and NH3-N). This study reveals new patterns in microplastic pollution in the Wei River, underscoring the need for targeted environmental strategies. Our findings provide novel insights into the characteristics and distribution of microplastics, significantly adding to the current understanding of riverine microplastic pollution. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) contamination has been reported in all environmental compartments, but very limited information is available at higher-altitude lakes. Nainital Lake, located at a high altitude in the Indian Himalayas, has various ecosystem services and is the major source of water for Nainital town, but the MP abundance is still unknown. This study presents the first evidence of the abundance and distribution of MP in Nainital Lake. Surface water and sediment samples were analysed from 16 different sites in and around the catchment area of Nainital Lake. The MP were observed in all the samples, and their abundance in surface water was 8.6–56.0 particles L−1 in the lake and 2.4–88.0 particles L−1 in hotspot sites. In the surface sediment, MP abundance ranged from 0.4–10.6 particles g−1, while in the hotspot sediment, the mean abundance was 0.6 ± 0.5 particles g−1. Fibers were the dominant MP, while 0.02–1 mm were the predominant size of MP particles. The results of chemical characterization showed the presence of six polymers, among which high-density polyethylene was the most abundant. The Polymer Hazard Index assessment classified the identified polymers as low-to high-risk categories, with a higher abundance of low- (polypropylene) and medium- (polyethylene)-risk polymers. Tourist activities and run-off catchments can be considered the major sources of MP, which can affect the ecosystem. Minimal concentrations of MP were observed in the tube well and drinking water, which depicts the direct risks to humans and, thus, the need for remedial measures to prevent MP contamination in drinking water. This study improves the knowledge of MP contamination in the higher-altitude freshwater lake, which can be the major pathway for the transport of MP to the rivers, and also emphasizes the need for waste management in Nainital town. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Floating marine debris (FMD) poses several threats to marine species, such as entanglement, ingestion, and the transport of pollutants. The Shiretoko Peninsula, located in northern Japan, is a registered World Natural Heritage Site and a biodiversity hotspot. However, FMD has not yet been thoroughly investigated in this region. In 2022, sighting surveys were conducted in Abashiri (west side of the peninsula) and Rausu (east side) to assess the abundance, composition, and distribution of FMD. The mean densities were notably higher in Abashiri, and there was more fishing-related debris in Rausu. Regarding local human activities, the population and number of tourists are higher in Abashiri, and fishing activities are higher in Rausu. While marine pollution is a global issue, our study suggests that addressing it should commence with community-based management at the local level. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Sea turtle mortality is often related to materials that reach the coast from different anthropic activities worldwide. This study aimed to investigate whether sea turtle mortality was related to older marine problems, such as solid waste, or one of the largest oil spill accidents on the Brazilian coast, that occurred in 2019. We posed three questions: 1) Are there solid residues in the digestive tract samples, and which typology is the most abundant? 2) Can meso‑ and macro-waste marine pollutants cause mortality? 3) Is the dark material found really oil? A total of 25 gastrointestinal content (GC) samples were obtained, of which 22 ingested waste of anthropogenic origin and 18 were necropsied. These 22 samples were obtained during or after the 2019 oil spill, of which 17 specimens were affected, making it possible to suggest oil ingestion with the cause of death in the animals that could be necropsied. Macroscopic data showed that the most abundant solid waste was plastic (76.05 %), followed by fabrics (12.18 %) and oil-like materials. However, chemical data confirmed only three specimens with oil levels ranging from remnants to high. It was possible to infer possible causes of death in 16 of the total 18 necropsied cases: Most deaths were due to respiratory arrest (62.5 %), followed by pulmonary edema (12.5 %), cachexia syndrome (12.5 %), circulatory shock (6.25 %), and head trauma (6.25 %), which may have been caused by contact with solid waste, oil, or both. The study showed that not all dark material found in the GCs of turtles killed in oiled areas is truly oil, and in this sense, a chemical analysis step to prove the evidence of oil must be added to international protocols. © 2024,\n",
       " The Bay of Bengal (BoB) is home to a range of commercially important species with different food habits and feeding features. Microplastic (MP) contamination in the fish of BoB, like in many other marine environments, is a significant environmental concern. The study aimed to investigate the presence of microplastics (MPs) in the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of selected commercial marine fishes from the Bangladesh coast of the BoB. Six fish species (Escualosa thoracata, Tenualosa ilisha, Johnius belangerii, Trichiurus lepturus, Planiliza parsia, and Mystus gulio) were investigated (n = 120) following hydrogen peroxide digestion, and floatation (saline solution) protocols. After analyses, a total number of 696 MPs (dimension 0.3 to 5 mm) were identified. Moreover, the highest occurrence of MPs in fish GITs was found in planktivorous fish (average of 7.7 items/individual), followed by omnivorous (average of 5.2 items/individual), and carnivorous fish (average of 4.6 items/individual) (p < 0.001). However, planktivorous E. thoracata showed the highest number of MPs per g of GIT (average of 30.99 items/g GIT), whereas T. ilisha showed the lowest count (average of 0.77 items/g GIT). Different types of MPs (fibers (19 to 76%), fragments (6 to 61%), films (8 to 35%), microbeads (0 to 5%), and foams (0 to 2%)) were also observed. In terms of the color of MPs, the transparent, black, green, and blue types were the most common. Polymers were found as polyethylene (35 to 43%), polyethylene terephthalate (28 to 35%), polyamide (20 to 31%), and polystyrene (0 to 7%). The study provides a significant incidence of MPs in fish from the Bangladesh part of the BoB, which is very concerning. Therefore, long-term research is indispensable to ascertain the variables affecting the presence of MPs in fish, their origins, and their potential effects on the BoB fisheries. Stringent policies on plastic use and disposal should be strongly urged in this coastal region.

       " Limited information exists on the potential of aged microplastics to induce photodegradation of organic pollutants under sunlight irradiation. In this work, nicotine (NIC), a widespread emerging contaminant, was used as a model organic substrate to investigate this innovative degradation process. Polystyrene (PS) pellets were artificially aged and became rich in oxygenated moieties with their carbonyl index reaching 0.43 ± 0.04 after 4 d of aging. The degradation of NIC photosensitized by aged PS at different pH values was monitored for 6 h under simulated sunlight irradiation (650 W/m2). The maximum degradation rate was observed at pH = 11 (75 % NIC removal from a 10 mg L−1 solution containing 50 g L−1 aged PS pellets), suggesting that the unprotonated NIC is the most photoreactive form. Increasing the PS load from 50 to 200 g L−1 accelerated NIC degradation. The addition of 2.5 mg L−1 humic acids had a slight enhancement role (82 % NIC degradation), which confirms their effectiveness as photosensitizers. NIC photosensitization by aged PS was also studied in the presence of t-butanol (55 % NIC removal in solutions containing 100 mg L−1 t-butanol) and in anoxic conditions (NIC solution purged with N2; 95 % NIC removal), to gain insight into the respective roles of the potentially formed •OH and 1O2. The main photo-produced reactive species involved in NIC degradation likely were the triplet states of the PS beads (3PS*). Differently from most advanced oxidation processes, NIC's photodegradation by aged PS was not affected by increasing amount of chloride and we observed negligible differences between NIC degradation in ultra-pure water and seawater. The effectiveness of irradiated PS towards NIC photodegradation was also investigated in tap water and secondary wastewater. Overall, the possibility to decontaminate polluted water with waste-derived materials is interesting in the framework of circular economy. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic pollution has been a widespread issue across the world ever since its invention in the early 1900s to its flourishment during the Industrial Revolution. The viciousness of plastics further elevates with the emergence of microplastics with smaller size and larger surface area than larger plastic debris. Smaller plastic particles of micro- and nano-size range are ubiquitous in all environmental compartments and have the potential to penetrate the biological system resulting in bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Evaluation of the presence of microplastics in the water and soil of an area is necessary for the implementation of precautionary and remedial measures. The present study attempts to evaluate the extent of microplastic pollution along the beaches of Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala, India. Surface sediment samples were collected from 25 locations across the coastal line of Thiruvananthapuram. Microplastics were quantified and categorized based on their colour, shape, size, and composition. Visual identification and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy were used for the estimation. The result revealed that the majority of plastic particles present were fibres accounting for around 80.80%. The maximum distribution of particles was reported from the sampling location at Thazhampalli-Chirayinkeezhu and Bheemapally. Around 78.05% of particles were coloured while the remaining were either white or colourless. Nylon fibres and polypropylene fragments were the dominant polymer types obtained. The results point to the role of fishing activities as the major source of microplastic input along the coastal beach sediments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have the potential to modify aquatic microbial communities and distribute microorganisms, including pathogens. This poses a potential risk to aquatic life and human health. Despite this, the fate of ‘hitchhiking’ microbes on MPs that traverse different aquatic habitats remains largely unknown. To address this, we conducted a 50-day microcosm experiment, manipulating estuarine conditions to study the exchange of bacteria and microeukaryotes between river, sea and plastisphere using a long-read metabarcoding approach. Our findings revealed a significant increase in bacteria on the plastisphere, including Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Hyphomonas, Brevundimonas, Aquabacterium and Thalassolituus, all of which are known for their pollutant degradation capabilities, specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We also observed a strong association of plastic-degrading fungi (i.e., Cladosporium and Plectosphaerella) and early-diverging fungi (Cryptomycota, also known as Rozellomycota) with the plastisphere. Sea MPs were primarily colonised by fungi (70%), with a small proportion of river-transported microbes (1%–4%). The mere presence of MPs in seawater increased the relative abundance of planktonic fungi from 2% to 25%, suggesting significant exchanges between planktonic and plastisphere communities. Using microbial source tracking, we discovered that MPs only dispersed 3.5% and 5.5% of river bacterial and microeukaryotic communities into the sea, respectively. Hence, although MPs select and facilitate the dispersal of ecologically significant microorganisms, drastic compositional changes across distinct aquatic habitats are unlikely. © 2024 The Authors.

       " This systematic review aims to comprehensively review and critically analyze the status of microplastics (MPs) in ASEAN countries. 273 publications related to ASEAN were shortlisted for analysis. The findings showed that 28 (10.2%) articles are review-based studies, and 245 articles (89.8%) are data analysis or experiment-based studies published between 2017 and December 31, 2022. Among the 10 ASEAN countries, Indonesia and Malaysia reported the highest number of studies in the year 2021, while Laos has not published any articles on MPs and Myanmar has the least (only one). Most of the samplings of MPs were done in sediments, water sources, and marine ecosystems, followed by studies of solid waste and air. Only 13 articles out of 273 reported on the effects of MPs on human health in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. Microscopy examination and FTIR techniques were commonly used for MP detection. Fiber and fragment shapes and all common colors were identified. Sizes and concentrations of particles were reported randomly without any specific unit of measurement. Removal studies were focused on drinking water. Heterogeneity in sampling methods, analysis techniques, and reporting units hinders comparison and conclusion on the present state of knowledge. Future remedies focus on homogeneity in MPs analysis and characterization. This comprehensive review would be beneficial to policymakers and researchers in ASEAN to develop effective strategies for addressing MPs issues in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution in karst systems is still poorly studied, despite the presence of protected species and habitats, and important water reserves. Vulnerable key species hosted in these habitats could consume or assimilate microplastics, which can irreversibly damage management efforts, and thus ecosystems functionality. This can be particularly true for subterranean water habitats where microplastic pollution effects on wildlife management programs are not considered. The aim of this study is to provide a case study from the Classical Karst Region, which hosts peculiar habitats and key species protected at European level, such as the olm Proteus anguinus. As this area has been deeply exploited and modified over time, and is adjacent to highways, roads and railways, which could contribute to pollution within the karst system, threatening the ecosystems, it provides a perfect model system. In this study we collected and investigated water and sediment samples from aquatic environments of surface and subterranean habitats hosting several subterranean environment-adapted organisms. Examined particles were counted and characterized by size, color and shape via visual identification under a microscope, with and without UV light. Furthermore, spectroscopic analyses were carried out in order to identify microplastics typology. Microplastics were found in all examined habitats. In water, microplastics concentration ranged from 37 to 86 items/L, in sediments from 776 to 2064 items/kg. Fibre-shape was the main present, followed by fragments and beads, suggesting multiple sources of pollution, especially textile products. Most of the particles were fluorescent under UV light and were mainly transparent, while not-fluorescent ones were especially black, blue or brown. Samples contained especially polyesters and copolymers. These results highlight intense MP pollution in karst areas, with significant impacts on water quality, and potential effects on subterranean environment-dwelling species. We stress the importance of monitoring pollution in these critical environments for biodiversity and habitat conservation: monitoring in karst areas must become a priority for habitat and species protection, and water resources management, improving analyses on a larger number of aquatic surface and subterranean habitats. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study examined the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of 384 fishes classified into four species from 11 sites in 2022 from the southern part of the Caspian Sea. GITs of fishes were collected and digested in H2O2 and KOH at 45 °C for 72 h. After filtration, extracted MPs were observed under a stereomicroscope, and selected MP particles were identified using FTIR. Presence of MPs was 68.98% in the GIT of the investigated fish. The mean abundance of MPs was 5.9 ± 0.9 MPs/GIT in Rutilus kutum, 9.2 ± 1.2 MPs/GIT in Chelon auratus, 3.6 ± 0.7 MPs/GIT in Alosa braschnikowi, and 2.7 ± 0.5 MPs/GIT in Vimba vimba. The predominant form of MPs was fiber (58.21%), followed by fragment (34.77%). Black (34.4%), white (19.07%), and blue (14.58%) were the most frequently detected colors of MPs. Overall, 6 MP polymers were identified, dominantly polypropylene (42.86%), polystyrene (17.86%), and cellophane (14.28%). The western part of the Caspian Sea (mostly tourist spots and urban areas) showed more MP pollution in fish compared to the eastern part. Polymer hazard index (PHI) revealed alarming microplastic contamination in the southern Caspian Sea. The PHI value of the present study showed that PES (PHI = 8403.78) and PS (PHI = 535.80) were “Extreme danger” and “Danger” risk categories, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " The monitoring of plastics in freshwater ecosystems has witnessed a significant increase in recent years, driven by the awareness that approximately 80 % of marine plastic litter originates from terrestrial sources transported to the seas through lakes and rivers. Consequently, it is imperative to develop monitoring plans that offer a comprehensive understanding of plastic contamination in these aquatic environments, given their seasonal variations in hydrochemical characteristics and anthropogenic sources. Historically, most global lake monitoring campaigns have been limited to one-time or, at most, seasonal sampling. In this context, the primary objective of the present study was to assess the quantitative and qualitative monthly variations of floating plastics in Lake Maggiore, a large European lake with high ecological and economic significance. Twelve transverse transects were conducted from January to December 2022 using a Manta-net with a 100 μm mesh. Characterization of each plastic particle was performed using a μ-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscope (μFT-IR). The results revealed relatively low levels of contamination in Lake Maggiore when compared with other lakes worldwide exclusively from a secondary origin. However, a considerable heterogeneity was observed, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, we identified a 13-fold difference between the minimum (0.02 plastics/m3 in September) and maximum (0.29 plastics/m3 in December) concentrations of plastics, accompanied by significant variations in polymer composition. Our monitoring underscored the necessity of also considering the temporal variation as a potential factor influencing plastic contamination in a lake. Moreover, frequent sampling emerged as a crucial requirement to accurately gauge the extent of plastic pollution, yielding robust and valuable data essential for effective environmental management. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Biodegradable plastics have been massively produced and used as potential substitutes for conventional plastics, resulting in their inevitable entry into the environment and generation of biodegradable microplastics (MPs). The sulfidation transformation of MPs is an important process for their transformation in anoxic environments (e.g., sediments, anaerobic activated sludges) that can alter their environmental effects and risks. However, how sulfides induce the transformation of biodegradable MPs and whether they are similar to conventional MPs remains unknown. In the present study, we compared the transformation and mechanism of conventional polyethylene (PE) MPs and biodegradable poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) MPs during sulfidation. The results demonstrated that sulfidation resulted in oxidation of PE MPs, whereas PBAT MPs underwent reduction and had higher physical damage, as evidenced by fragmentation, chain scission and organic compound release. Besides, reactive oxygen species and sulfide species played important roles in the sulfidation of PE and PBAT MPs, respectively. The presence of ester groups in PBAT MPs led to their hydrolysis, causing chain scission and further reduction. Furthermore, sulfidation caused a higher degree of adsorption and toxicity alterations in PBAT MPs than in PE MPs. This work uncovers critical abiotic transformation behaviors of biodegradable microplastics and highlights the necessity of considering microplastic structural features to accurately predict microplastic occurrence. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " We report the first empirical confirmation of the co-occurrence of organophosphate esters (OPEs) additives and microplastics (MPs) in benthic compartments from the Loire estuary. Higher median concentrations of MPs (3387 items/kg dw), ∑13tri-OPEs (12.0 ng/g dw) and ∑4di-OPEs (0.7 ng/g dw) were measured in intertidal sediments with predominance of fine particles, and under higher anthropogenic pressures, with a general lack of seasonality. Contrarily, Scrobicularia plana showed up to 4-fold higher ∑tri-OPE concentrations in summer (reaching 37.0 ng/g dw), and similar spatial distribution. Polyethylene predominated in both compartments. Tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), its degradation metabolite (BEHP) and tris-(2-chloro, 1-methylethyl) phosphate (TCIPP) were the most abundant OPEs in sediments, while TCIPP predominated in S. plana. The biota-sediment accumulation factors suggest bioaccumulation potential for chlorinated-OPEs, with higher exposure in summer. No significant correlations were generally found between OPEs and MPs in sediments suggesting a limited role of MPs as in-situ source of OPEs. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The adverse impacts of microplastics (MPs) or ocean acidification (OA) on mollusks have been widely reported, however, little is known about their combined effects on mollusks. The oysters Crassostrea gigas were exposed to two sizes of polystyrene MPs with 1 × 104 particles/L (small polystyrene MPs (SPS-MPs): 6 μm, large polystyrene MPs (LPS-MPs): 50–60 μm) at two pH levels (7.7 and 8.1) for 14 days. The antagonistic effects between MPs and OA on oysters were mainly observed. Single SPS-MPs exposure can induce CAT enzyme activity and LPO level in gills, while LPS-MPs exposure alone can increase PGK and PEPCK gene expression in digestive glands. Ocean acidification can increase clearance rate and inhibit antioxidant enzyme activity, whereas combined exposure of OA and SPS-MPs can affect the metabolomic profile of digestive glands. This study emphasized that the potential toxic effects of MPs under the scene of climate change should be concerned. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The flushing of wet wipes down toilets leads to blockages of sewerage systems. This, together with unregulated sewage discharge, often results in increasing numbers of wet wipes washing up onto beaches. However, it is unclear how long wet wipes can persist on the beach and whether they pose a prolonged public health risk if contaminated by E. coli. In this mesocosm study, three types of wet wipes (plastic containing, and home and commercially compostable) colonised with E. coli were buried in beach sand and their degradation, tensile strength, and concentration of E. coli was quantified over 15 weeks. Wet wipes containing plastic remained largely intact for 15 weeks, whilst both compostable wet wipes fragmented and degraded. Importantly, E. coli persisted on all three wet wipe types, representing localised reservoirs of E. coli in the sand, which could present a human health risk at the beach. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " In Africa, Morocco is the 10th largest producer of plastic. The severity of this plastic has attracted increasing amounts of attention in the Moroccan Atlantic and Mediterranean in recent years. However, at the national level, there is limited knowledge of plastic pollution. To obtain an exhaustive and comprehensive evaluation of plastic pollution levels in Morocco, large-scale monitoring is needed on all the coasts of the country. In this context, this paper examined the composition, abundance, distribution, source and quality of beaches on two Moroccan coasts using four beach quality indices along 29 beaches. During two seasons, a total of 72,105 items were counted. The mean litter abundance was 0.31 items/m2 and the Mediterranean beaches were more dense than the Atlantic beaches. In particular, litter density was greater in spring (0.35 items/m2) than in summer (0.29 items/m2). The data indicate considerable differences in the density of marine debris according to the seasonality, beach typology and presence of rivers. Hazardous litter items were collected along both Moroccan coasts, constituting 8.41 % of the total collected items, with a mean of 0.026 items/m2. The use of environmental indices allowed us to classify Moroccan beaches as “moderate cleanliness”, “moderate abundance” of plastics, “moderately safe” presence of hazardous litter and “mediocre” environmental status. The findings of the present study indicate that the sources of litter on both Moroccan coasts come mainly from recreational activities and dumping. The waste management practices recommended for Moroccan beaches include reducing sources, mitigating mitigation measures and changing littering behavior. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Coastal mangrove forests provide a suite of environmental services, including sequestration of anthropogenic contamination. Yet, research lags on the environmental fate and potential human health risks of mangrove-sequestered contaminants in the context of mangrove removal for development and range shifts due to climate change. To address this, we conducted a study on Moloka'i, Hawai'i, comparing microplastic and pesticide contamination in coastal compartments both at areas modified by non-native red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and unmodified, open coastline. Sediment, porewater, and mangrove plant tissues were collected to quantify microplastic and pesticide concentrations across ecosystem type. Average microplastics were similar between mangrove (8.89 items/kg) and non-mangrove areas (9.01 items/kg) in sediment and porewater, but mangrove roots were a substantial reservoir of microplastics (2004 items/kg). Additionally, there was a strong relationship between proximity to urban development and microplastics detected. Six pesticides were detected, most commonly the insecticide bifenthrin, found in most sediment samples (11.3 ng/g), all root samples (243.3 ng/g), and one propagule sample (8.60 ng/g). Other pesticides detected with appreciable concentrations include the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the legacy insecticide transformation product, p,p’-DDE. The other detections, all at concentrations < 1 ng/g, were p,p’-DDT, trifluralin, and permethrin. The high concentrations of bifenthrin in roots compared to lower concentrations detected in sediment suggest that mangrove roots strongly accumulate some pesticides, indicating mangrove roots as a sink for organic contaminants. Study methods could be applied to other Hawaiian Islands and other locations where mangroves have been introduced to further examine the observed trends. Additional information is needed to investigate the fate and cycling of pesticides and microplastics adhered to mangrove roots, to better inform non-native mangrove removal efforts on Moloka'i and elsewhere. © 2023 The Author(s),\n",
       " To mitigate marine pollution, we improved the photo-Fenton reaction of modified nanoscale CuO/BiVO4 photocatalysts to resolve the challenge of efficient microplastic degradation in wastewater treatment. Material property analysis and computational results revealed that deposition of CuO onto BiVO4 nanocomposites improved photocatalytic activity by promoting an excess of electrons in CuO and surface charge transfer, resulting in an increased production of e−-h+ for ROS generation via H2O2 activation. 1O2 was dominated and identified through quenching experiments, XPS analysis, and EPR. ROS generation increased via H2O2 activation, causing major surface abrasion and increased carbonyl and vinyl indices in microplastics. Treated water had minimal impact on Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. seedling growth but caused considerable mortality in cell lines and Moina macrocopa mortality at greater dosages due to their sensitivity to ions and H2O2 residuals. Overall, this treatment can effectively degrade microplastics, but the dilution of treated water is still needed before being discharged. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Flame retardants (FRs) are released throughout the plastic life cycle, potentially impacting the environment, biodiversity, and human health. This study analyzed novel flame retardants (NFR) in marine plastic litter (MPL) from six coastal areas in central Chile in November 2017. Target chemicals (n = 19) were analyzed using ultrasonic extraction with hexane, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry (GC–MS). From all nineteen NFRs analyzed, only ten (53 %) were routinely detected. BTBPE (1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane) showed the highest concentrations at the Bellavista site (618 to 424,000 pg g−1), and HBB (Hexabromobiphenyl), banned since 1970, was detected in Coliumo (2630 to 13,700 pg g−1). These results show emerging transport patterns and underscore the critical need for enhanced waste management practices for MPL in coastal regions to prevent adverse impacts on marine biodiversity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) accumulating in freshwater sediment have raised concerns about potential risks to benthic dwelling organisms, yet few studies have examined the long-term impacts caused by MP exposure. This study investigated alterations to lipid profiles in an Australian freshwater invertebrate, Chironomus tepperi, induced by polyethylene MP fragments (1–45 μm) at environmentally relevant concentrations (125, 250, 500 and 1000 MPs/kg sediment), using a two-generational experimental design. In the parental generation, the relative abundance of triacylglycerols, total fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids exhibited apparent hormetic patterns, with low-concentration stimulation and high-concentration inhibition observed. The overall trend in these lipid classes is consistent with previously observed changes to polar metabolite profiles, indicating that ingestion of MPs could inhibit nutrient assimilation from food leading to disruption of energy availability. In the first filial generation continuously exposed to MPs, however, abundance of cholesterol and total fatty acids increased with increasing exposure concentrations, suggesting different effects on energy metabolism between the parental generation and offspring. No differences in the lipidome were observed in first filial larvae that were not exposed, implying that MPs pose negligible carry-over effects. Overall, the combined results of this study together with a preceding metabolomics study provide evidence of a physical effect of MPs with subsequent impacts to bioenergetics. Nevertheless, future research is required to explore the potential long-term impacts caused by MPs, and to unravel the impacts of the surfactant control as a potential contributor to the observed hormetic response, particularly for studies exploring sub-lethal effects of MP exposure using sensitive omics techniques. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) accumulation in rocky shore organisms has limited knowledge. This study investigated MPs accumulation in filter-feeding oysters, herbivorous limpets and carnivorous snails to assess their performance as sentinel species in the MPs trophic transfer. The samples were obtained along a contamination gradient in the Santos Estuarine System, Brazil. All three studied species showed MPs concentrations related to the contamination gradient, being the oysters the species that showed the highest levels, followed by limpets and snails (average of less and most contaminated sites of 1.06–8.90, 2.28–5.69 and 0.44–2.10 MP g−1, respectively), suggesting that MPs ingestion rates are linked to feeding habits. MPs were mainly polystyrene and polyacetal. The polymer types did not vary among sites nor species. Despite minor differences in percentages and diversity of size, shape, and color classes, the analyzed species were equally able to demonstrate dominance of small, fiber, transparent, black and blue MPs. Thus, oysters, limpets, and snails are proposed as sentinels of MPs in monitoring assessments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic debris in the marine environment is a global problem. Biodegradable polymers are being developed as alternatives to petroleum-based plastics, and quick and easy methods for screening for bacterial strains that can degrade such polymers are needed. As a screening method, the clear zone method has been widely used but has technical difficulties such as plate preparation and interpretation of results. In this study, we adapted the MicroResp™ system to easily detect biodegradation activity of marine bacteria in a 3-day assay. Among the 6 bacterial strains tested, 3, 2 and 1 strain degraded poly (butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA), poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), respectively. Only one strain that showed degradation activity of PBSA and PCL in the MicroResp™ system was also positive in the clear zone assay on the respective emulsion plates. Our results show that the adapted MicroResp™ system can screen for bacterial strains that degrade plastic. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials, mainly consisting of polymers. The use of plastics has increased to over 300 million metric tonnes in recent years, and by 2050, it is expected to grow to 800 million. Presently, a mere 10% of plastic waste is recycled, with approximately 75% ended up in landfills. Inappropriate disposal of plastic waste into the environment poses a threat to human lives and marine species. Therefore, this review article highlights potential routes for converting plastic/microplastic waste into valuable resources to promote a greener and more sustainable environment. The literature review revealed that plastics/microplastics (P/MP) could be recycled or upcycled into various products or materials via several innovative processes. For example, P/MP are recycled and utilized as anodes in lithium-ion (Li-ion) and sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries. The anode in Na-ion batteries comprising PP carbon powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of ∼340 mAh/g at 0.01 A/g current state. In contrast, integrating Fe3O4 and PE into a Li-ion battery yielded an excellent capacity of 1123 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g current state. Additionally, recycled Nylon displayed high physical and mechanical properties necessary for excellent application as 3D printing material. Induction heating is considered a revolutionary pyrolysis technique with improved yield, efficiency, and lower energy utilization. Overall, P/MPs are highlighted as abundant resources for the sustainable production of valuable products and materials such as batteries, nanomaterials, graphene, and membranes for future applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is ubiquitous in freshwater environments, including rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Plastic particles can accumulate in the sediment mainly in lentic environments offering several risks to the benthic community. While there are records on the distribution of microplastics in freshwater systems worldwide, limited research has been conducted on their distribution in reservoirs in the Southern Hemisphere. We investigated the levels of microplastic pollution in the sediments from the Billings Reservoir, Brazil, located in an area with high anthropogenic activities. Microplastics were recovered from all sediment samples, indicating their extensive distribution in the reservoir. Microplastic abundance in the sediment ranged from 11,800 to 31,900 particles.kg−1 dry weight. We observed different abundances between the shapes of microplastics: fiber > fragment > film > foam. Colorless fibers were the most abundant particles and small-sized (100 – 300 µm) microplastics were predominant. Of all the microplastics identified by FTIR, polyethylene was the most common type (25.0%), followed by polycarbonate, polypropylene, and nitrocellulose, each polymer representing 15.0% of the analyzed particles. The entry and the damming area of the reservoir seem to be more susceptible to the accumulation of microplastics in the sediment. This study was the first to report microplastic pollution in a Brazilian reservoir, which elucidates the incipience of the studies investigating microplastic pollution in Brazil. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Antarctica, and its surrounding environment, is considered untouched, and it is thought that it is free from microplastic (MP) pollution. However, recent studies and science projects have reported MPs in both water and sediment in the South Polar Regions. These reports state that MP pollution occurs in this region due to fishing, tourism, and research activities by the nearby countries, with natural circulation also part of it. The Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has given attention to MP pollution and has initiated research on it. MPs are tiny plastic particles with a size of less than 5 mm. They have two types: 1. Primary MPs, which have been manufactured directly from various applications like cosmetics and scrubbing, etc. 2. Secondary MPs, which are generated by the photochemical degradation of large plastics. Although several studies have been done, there is a quite gap in our understanding of the concentration, characteristics, and impact of plastics on the ecosystem of the Antarctic Region. The impact of MP pollution in this region may be very high. The presence of MPs is a serious issue that is affecting not only the aquatic environment but also humans. It is an alarming situation that causes environmental damage. The main objective of this paper is to review MP introduction, occurrence in biotic and abiotic components, sources, harmful effects, and detection methods/techniques. This review highlights the various methodologies and analyses like density separation, microscope observation of MP’s properties Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectrometer, respectively, and urges for more research in the future, giving several recommendations to maintain the pristine region near Antarctica. © 2024, Kasetsart University Faculty of International Maritime Studies.

       " Microplastic ingestion by marine fishes has been of particular interest, as many species are the target of commercial fisheries and, thus, have a strong connection with human health. Consumption of microplastic thru seafood is likely to have harmful effects on people globally but mainly on social groups that highly depend on fisheries for self-consumption. Here, we first aim to characterize the presence of microplastics in species targeted by small-scale fishers; and explore if the fish consumption of microplastic particles is associated with biological factors. Second, we applied semi-structured interviews to small-scale fishers to investigate, from a socio-environmental perspective, the potential social and environmental impacts of contamination by microplastics on the local communities. We found that commercially important fish families regularly contained microplastics in their tissues, and the consumption of microplastics by fish caught through traditional fishing gear depends on traits such as species mobility but the microplastic load also depended on the type of fishing gear used. Species with a wide home range had a higher load of microplastics than fish with a small home range but also seemed to be related to the fishing method. The observed differences in microplastic content on target species are likely to be transferred to humans in a non-random fashion. This work implies that microplastic pollution in commercial fish might represent an environmental and social issue that is not well understood by the fishing community in the Mexican Caribbean, with potential ramifications for marine resource management. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " This study analyzed the distribution characteristics and sources of pollutants in the coastal estuaries of Zhanjiang Bay (ZJB) to provide theoretical and data support for the scientific prevention and control of bay pollution. Monitoring data from eight rivers and flood drains flowing into ZJB in March 2021 were used to analyze the composition and spatial distribution characteristics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phthalate esters (PAEs) in the water bodies of the bay. The dominant components in the eight rivers and flood drains were 3–4-ring PAHs, with Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and Dibutyl-O-phthalate (DBP) being the main PAE compounds. Higher pollutant levels were observed in residential areas, aquaculture zones, and industrial areas. Eigen-ratio analysis and principal component analysis were used to identify pollution sources, including atmospheric inputs (coal, petroleum products, biomass combustion products), offshore petroleum pollution, and plastic pollution sources. The assessment showed that atmospheric inputs contributed to 89.75% of the total PAHs in the bay, with coal and biomass combustion accounting for 62.12% and petroleum fuel combustion accounting for 27.63%. The content of ΣPAEs ranged from 588.43 to 1427.26 ng·L−1, with a mean value of 906.59 ng·L−1, which is at a low to medium level compared to other regions of China and abroad, indicating a medium-low level of pollution risk. The results of this study have important implications for guiding urban development, adjusting energy consumption structures, and planning pollution prevention and control measures in ZJB. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Since the 1950s, usage of plastic's ubiquity and durability have fostered significant microplastic pollution, set to double in oceans by 2030. Originating from diverse sources including product wear, waste, and now identified e-waste recycling, these particles traverse to marine ecosystems, accumulating and causing ecological harm. Measuring less than 20 μm, microplastics can penetrate cell membranes, posing risks to animal and human health. Confronting this challenge demands improved detection, comprehensive understanding of behaviors, enhanced hazard assessment, and recognizing e-waste's contribution. Mitigation hinges on global pollution management, innovative sustainable materials, and reducing plastic and electronic waste dependency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " This study investigates the dynamics of microplastic infiltration into non-stationary sandy sediments, a pressing environmental concern due to the rising prevalence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems. An annular flume was used to simulate riverine bedform motion, examining the suspension and infiltration of denser-than-water microplastic particles, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), and polylactide (PLA). The experiments focused on various particle sizes (ranging from 0.2 to 5 mm in diameter) and bedform migration speeds, known as celerities. The findings indicate that particle size is a significant factor influencing the depth of infiltration and distribution within sediment layers, whereas the impact of bedform celerities and particle densities appears less significant. This research provides novel insights into the behavior of microplastics in dynamic sedimentary environments, highlighting the intricate interaction between microplastic characteristics and sedimentary processes. The results contribute to an enhanced understanding of microplastic distribution and accumulation in riverine systems, offering crucial data for developing predictive models and formulating potential remediation strategies for microplastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " In recent years, global attention has been extensively focused on the water pollution and health risks caused by microplastics(MPs), thereby making the treatment of microplastics a key area of research. Chemical removal and degradation present effective approaches to addressing this issue. Consequently, this review summarizes the latest research advancements in the chemical removal and degradation of microplastics in water, comparing the treatment efficacy and advantages and disadvantages of various removal/degradation techniques. It elucidates the chemical mechanisms underlying the removal/degradation of microplastics and identifies the primary influencing factors during the treatment process.

       " Data on MP in aquatic environments have low resolution in space and time. Scaling up sampling and increasing analysis throughput are the main bottlenecks. We combined two approaches: an uncrewed surface vehicle (USV) and near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for sampling and analysis of MP > 300 μm. We collected 35 water samples over 4 d in a coastal area. Samples were analyzed using NIR-HSI and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Spiked samples were used to determine recovery. We conclude that using a USV can mitigate issues of traditional trawls like scalability, repeatability, and contamination. NIR-HSI detects more polyethylene but less polypropylene than FTIR analysis and reduces analysis time significantly. Highly variable concentrations were found at both sampling locations, with mean MP concentration of 0.28 and 0.01 MP m-3 for location A and B respectively. USV sampling in tandem with NIR-HSI is an effective analytical pipeline for MP monitoring. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics were discovered in sea salts worldwide because they are directly supplied by seawater. This study explores the contamination of five traditionally produced and 10 branded sea salts with microplastics. The highest number of particles was found in the traditionally produced salt (563 items) an abundance of 106.67–3753.33 items/kg. Branded salts had abundance of 25.67 to 866.67 items/kg. There was no significant difference (p > 0.540) in the amount and abundance between these salts. The most predominant shape of microplastics was fiber. The particles sizes ranged from 17 μm to 4.86 mm. The predominant polymers were polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. The results indicate both traditionally produced and branded salts are contaminated with microplastics. It is necessary to implement technology to eliminate microplastics from abiotic sea salt to protect health and the environment. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Coastal environments, essential for about half of the world's population living near coastlines, face severe threats from human-induced activities such as intensified urbanization, aggressive development, and particularly, coastal sewage pollution. This type of pollution, comprising untreated sewage discharging nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals, microplastics, and organic compounds, significantly endangers these ecosystems. The issue of sewage in coastal areas is complex, influenced by factors like inadequate sewage systems, septic tanks, industrial and agricultural runoff, and natural processes like coastal erosion, further complicated by oceanic dynamics like tides and currents. A global statistic reveals that over 80 % of sewage enters the environment without treatment, contributing significantly to nitrogen pollution in coastal ecosystems. This pollution not only harms marine life and ecosystems through chemical contaminants and eutrophication, leading to hypoxic zones and biodiversity loss, but also affects human health through waterborne diseases and seafood contamination. Additionally, it has substantial economic repercussions, impacting tourism, recreation, and fisheries, and causing revenue and employment losses. Addressing this issue globally involves international agreements and national legislations, but their effectiveness is hindered by infrastructural disparities, particularly in developing countries. Thus, effective management requires a comprehensive approach including advanced treatment technologies, stringent regulations, regular monitoring, and international cooperation. The international scientific community plays a crucial role in fostering a collaborative and equitable response to this pressing environmental challenge. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Ingestion of microplastics can lead to deleterious consequences for organisms, as documented by numerous laboratory studies. The current knowledge is based on a multitude of effect studies, conducted with conventional fossil-based and non-degradable plastics. However, there is a lack of information about the acceptance and the effects of novel bio-based and biodegradable plastics. Biodegradable plastics are considered an alternative to conventional plastics and are showing rapidly growing production rates. Biodegradable plastics can disperse into the environment in the same way as conventional plastics do, becoming available to marine organisms. This study aims to provide new insights into the uptake and effects of biodegradable microplastics on marine invertebrates. Rockpool shrimp, Palaemon elegans, were fed with algal flakes coated with polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) and conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microparticles. Live observations showed that all of the different types of microplastics were ingested. After dissection of the shrimp, less LDPE particles were found in the stomachs than PLA and PHBV particles. This indicates a longer retention time of biodegradable microplastics compared to conventional microplastics. Presumably, less LDPE particles were ingested or evacuated from the stomach, probably by regurgitation. The ingestion of microparticles of all types of plastics induced enzymatic activity of short-chain carboxylesterases in the midgut glands of the shrimp. However, only PLA induced enzymatic activity of medium-chain carboxylesterases. Palaemon elegans showed no oxidative stress response after ingestion of microparticles, irrespective of polymer type. From our results we conclude that biodegradable plastics might have different effects than conventional plastics. The longer retention times of biodegradable plastics might enhance exposure to leaching additives and other harmful substances. Our study provides new insights into how biodegradable plastics might affect aquatic fauna and indicate that the use of biodegradable plastics needs to be reconsidered to some extent. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Marine litter and microplastic pollution in mangroves pose significant threats. This study of litter in Omani mangroves revealed an average density of 0.83 to 21.92 items/m2. Quriyat lagoon emerged as the most contaminated area, hosting 133 items/m2, while Qurum Natural Reserve lagoon showed the least contamination at 10 items/m2. Plastics constituted 73–96 % of the litter, with microplastic levels in sediment ranging from 6 to 256 pieces/kg. Al-Sawadi's lagoon had the highest microplastic abundance (27.52 ± 5.32 pieces/kg), in contrast to Al Qurum's Marine Protected Area with the lowest (0.60 ± 1.12 pieces/kg). Microplastics, categorized as fragments, pellets, and fibers, were distributed across zones 40.05 % landward, 30.97 % seaward, and 28.98 % in the middle mangrove zones. Primary plastic polymers identified were Polyethylene (PE) at 40 % and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) at 28 %, along with others found in specific areas. Our findings provide essential baseline data for future monitoring efforts and management strategies in Oman and other countries. © 2024,\n",
       " The environmental accumulation of microplastics poses a formidable global challenge, with tyre wear particles (TWPs) emerging as major and potentially harmful contributors to this particulate pollution. A critical pathway for TWPs to aquatic environments is via road drainage. While drainage assets are employed worldwide, their effectiveness in retaining microplastics of highly variable densities (TWP ~ 1–2.5 g cm3) remains unknown. This study examines their ability to impede the transfer of TWPs from the UK Strategic Road Network (SRN) to aquatic ecosystems. Samples were collected from the influent, effluent and sediments of three retention ponds and three wetlands. The rate of TWP generation is known to vary in response to vehicle speed and direction. To ascertain the significance of this variability, we further compared the mass of TWPs in drainage from curved and straight sections of the SRN across eight drainage outfalls. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) was used to quantify tyre wear using benzothiazole as a molecular marker for TWPs (with an internal standard benzothiazole-D4). Tyre wear was present in drainage from the SRN at concentrations of 2.86 ± 6 mg/L and was found within every sample analysed. Drainage from curved sections of the SRN contained on average a 40% greater TWP mass than straight sections but this was not significant. The presence of wetlands and retention ponds generally led to a reduction in TWP mass (74.9% ± 8.2). This effect was significant for retention ponds but not for wetlands; most probably due to variability among sites and sampling occasions. Similar drainage assets are used on a global scale; hence our results are of broad relevance to the management of TWP pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " This study was carried out at the Danube River and its tributaries during the Joint Danube Survey 4 (JDS4) expedition. Three freshwater benthic species were used to estimate the quantity of microplastics (MPs): Corbicula spp., Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (Claparede, 1862), and Polypedilum nubeculosum (Meigen, 1804). Following the kick and sweep technique, individuals were sampled using a hand net or dredge. In order to estimate the number of MP particles/individual particles/g wet body mass, the body mass and total length of all specimens were measured. Alkaline (Corbicula spp. and L. hoffmaisteri) and enzymatic (P. nubeculosum) protocols were performed for tissue degradation. All samples were filtered through glass microfiber filters (mesh size 0.5 µm). The particles were photographed, measured, and counted. A total of 1904, 169, and 204 MPs were isolated from Corbicula spp., L. hoffmaisteri, and P. nubeculosum, respectively. To confirm the chemical composition of isolated MPs, a subsample of 46 particles of the fragmented particles from 14 sampling sites was analysed via µ-ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis. The particles were characterised as polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene–polyethylene copolymer (PP-PE), nylon (polyamide-PA) and cellophane, with the domination of PET. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Management of plastic litter in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is expensive but crucial to avoid harms to critical environments. In the present work, an open-source numerical modelling chain is proposed to estimate the seasonal pathways and fates of macro-plastics, and hence support the effective planning and implementation of sea and beach cleaning operations. The proposed approach is applied to the nearshore region that includes the MPA of Capo Milazzo (Italy). A sensitivity analysis on the influence of tides, wind, waves and river floods over the year indicates that seasonality only slightly affects the location and extension of the macro-plastic accumulation zones, and that beach cleaning operations should be performed in autumn. Instead, the influence of rivers on plastic litter distribution is crucial for the optimal planning of cleaning interventions in the coastal area. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastics ranging from nano-scale to micron-scale are frequently ingested by many marine animals. These particles exhibit biotoxicity and additionally perform as vectors that convey and amass adsorbed chemicals within organisms. Meanwhile, the frequency of detection of the benzophenone-3 and ciprofloxacin can be adsorbed on plastic particles, then accumulated in bivalves, causing biotoxicity. To understand their unknown accumulative kinetics in vivo affected by different plastic sizes and toxic effect from co-exposure, several scenarios were set up in which the mode organism were exposed to 0.6 mg/L of polystyrene carrying benzophenone-3 and ciprofloxacin in three sizes (300 nm, 38 μm, and 0.6 mm). The live Asian green mussels were chosen as mode organism for exposure experiments, in which they were exposed to environments with plastics of different sizes laden with benzophenone-3 and ciprofloxacin, then depurated for 7 days. The bioaccumulation and depuration kinetics of benzophenone-3 and ciprofloxacin were measured using HPLC-MS/MS after one week of exposure and depuration. Meanwhile, their toxic effect were investigated by measuring the changes in six biomarkers (condition index, reactive oxygen species, catalase, glutathione, lipid peroxidation, cytochrome P450 and DNA damage). The bioconcentration factors in mussels under different exposure conditions were 41.48–111.75 for benzophenone-3 and 6.45 to 12.35 for ciprofloxacin. The results suggested that microplastics and nanoplastics can act as carriers to increase bioaccumulation and toxicity of adsorbates in mussels in a size-dependent manner. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species caused by microplastics and nanoplastics led to increased DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and changes in antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants during exposure. Marked disruption of antioxidant defenses and genotoxic effects in mussels during depuration indicated impaired recovery. Compared to micron-scale plastic with sizes over a hundred micrometers that had little effect on bivalve bioaccumulation and toxicity, nano-scale plastic greatly enhanced the biotoxicity effect. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastics introduced into the natural environment persist, degrade, and fragment into smaller particles due to various environmental factors. Microplastics (MPs) (ranging from 1 μm to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs) (less than 1 μm) have emerged as pollutants posing a significant threat to all life forms on Earth. Easily ingested by living organisms, they lead to ongoing bioaccumulation and biomagnification. This review summarizes existing studies on the sources of MPs and NPs in various environments, highlighting their widespread presence in air, water, and soil. It primarily focuses on the sources, fate, degradation, fragmentation, transport, and ecotoxicity of MPs and NPs. The aim is to elucidate their harmful effects on marine organisms, soil biota, plants, mammals, and humans, thereby enhancing the understanding of the complex impacts of plastic particles on the environment. Additionally, this review highlights remediation technologies and global legislative and institutional measures for managing waste associated with MPs and NPs. It also shows that effectively combating plastic pollution requires the synergization of diverse management, monitoring strategies, and regulatory measures into a comprehensive policy framework. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " It is generally acknowledged that microplastic pollutants are prevalent in ocean waters and sediments across a range of tropical, temperate, subpolar, and polar regions. The waters surrounding King George Island are significantly impacted by human activities, particularly those related to scientific stations, fishing, and tourism. Organisms, such as Laternula elliptica, can be used as environmental monitors due to the likelihood that they will bioaccumulate pollutants. The goal of this study was to quantify and identify plastic and cellulosic micro-fragments and microfibers present in the soft body of clams (n = 21), collected from Fildes Bay near sewage and wastewater discharges. Plastic and cellulose microfragments and microfibers were counted, and their compositions were determined using FT-IR. All 21 individuals sampled contained fragments and fibers, with a total of 900 items detected (42.86 ± 25.36 mean ± SD items per individual), or 1.82 items g.wet mass−1. 58 % of items were cellulose and 22 % plastic. Considering the plastic polymer compositions, 28.57 % were polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 21.43 % acrylic, 14.29 % high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 14.29 % Polypropylene (PP), 7.14 % ultra-high drawn polyethylene filament (UHMWPE), 7.14 % polyester and 7.14 % Polyethylene. The quantities and prevalence of MP in L. elliptica were higher than those found in other Antarctic marine species, and even in bivalves from populated regions of the world. Our work assessed the pollution status of L. elliptica near an effluent of wastewater plants and found that 95 % of individuals displayed MP and 100 % microfibers that could impact their population. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The kleptoparasitic pea crab Zaops ostreum lives within the gills of bivalves, including the economically important eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Previous research along the east coast of central Florida has found an average of 2.3 pieces of plastic per oyster. The goals of our research were to determine if filter-feeding oysters transfer microfibers to Z. ostreum via the crab: 1) actively consuming plastic particles, or 2) passively becoming entangled in microfibers. Our results show that both occur. While only 11.6 % of Z. ostreum (total n = 122) consumed microfibers, those that did had up to 14 pieces in their soft tissues. Similarly, only 7.4 % of Z. ostreum had microfibers entangled around their appendages. Mean lengths of consumed and entangled fibers were similar, 1.9 and 2.7 mm, respectively. Additional research is needed to understand the positive and negative impacts of microfibers associated with pea crabs on both species. © 2024,\n",
       " The pursuit of development in an economically sustainable and ecologically sound manner is a goal of modern society. It has been investing in products that minimize their environmental impact, particularly concerning the use of plastic. This material is highly detrimental to nature due to its toxicity and long decomposition period. The present study aims to analyze the feasibility of producing blocks made of concrete with different amounts of waste plastic taken from coastal and estuarine areas. After laboratory analysis, it was found that blocks containing 5% plastic exhibit good compressive strength and are lighter. Additionally, there was an increase in the acidity of the sample, a decrease in the density of the block, and reductions in both flexural and compressive strength. The prototype, composed of 5% plastic by mass, proves to be efficient for constructing single-story houses. It meets the minimum requirements for normative resistance, effectively encapsulating the plastic within the block and thereby reducing its environmental impact.

       " Microplastics (MPs) in soil can influence CO2 dynamics by altering organic carbon (OC) and microbial composition. Nevertheless, the fluctuation of CO2 response attributed to MPs in mangrove sediments is unclear. This study explores the impact of micro-sized polypropylene (mPP) particles on the carbon dynamics of intertidal mangrove sediments. In the high-tide level sediment, after 28 days, the cumulative CO2 levels for varying mPP dosages were as follows: 496.86 ± 2.07, 430.38 ± 3.84 and 447.09 ± 1.72 mg kg−1 for 0.1%, 1% and 10% (w/w) mPP, respectively. The CO2 emissions were found to be increased with a 0.1% (w/w) mPP level and decreased with 1% and 10% (w/w) mPP at high-tide level sediment, suggesting a tide level-specific dose dependence of the CO2 emission pattern in mangrove sediments. Overall, results indicated that the presence of mPP in mangrove sediments would potentially affect intertidal total CO2 storage under given experimental conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The Eastern Tropical and South-Eastern Pacific region is of global biodiversity importance. At COP26, the governments of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador committed to the expansion of existing MPAs to create a new Mega MPA, safeguarding the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor. It offers a profound step forward in conservation efforts but is not specifically designed to protect against the more diffuse anthropogenic threats, such as plastic pollution. We combine published data with our own unpublished records to assess the abundance and distribution of plastic pollution in the region. Macro- and microplastic concentrations varied markedly and were not significantly different when comparing areas inside and outside existing MPA boundaries. These findings highlight the diffuse and complex nature of plastic pollution and its ubiquitous presence across MPA boundaries. Understanding the sources and drivers of plastic pollution in the region is key to developing effective solutions. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have attracted global concern because of their harmful effects on marine biota; their toxic properties can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. Fish is an essential source of protein for humans, playing a crucial role in daily food intake. Until recently, MPs were addressed primarily as environmental pollutants, but they are now increasingly recognized as contaminants in the food supply. The present review has comprehended the current knowledge of MP contamination in freshwater and marine fishes of Asia, including 112 peer-reviewed sources from 2016 to 2023. The review recorded 422 Asian fishes (345 marine and 77 freshwater) to be contaminated with MPs. Clarias gariepinus and Selaroides leptolepi have shown maximum MP contamination in the freshwater and marine environments of Asia, respectively. Omnivorous and carnivorous fishes exhibited higher susceptibility to ingesting MPs. Benthopelagic, demersal, and reef-associated habitats were identified as more prone to MP accumulation. In both freshwater and marine environments, China has the highest number of contaminated species among all the countries. Pollution indices indicated high MP contamination in both freshwater and marine environments. A prevalence of fibers was recorded in all fishes. Black- and blue-colored MPs of <500 µm–1 mm size were found dominantly. Polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene were recorded as the prevalent plastic polymers in freshwater and marine fish, respectively. Overall, the review served as a comprehensive understanding of MP concentrations and variations between species, between feeding habits, and between geographic locations, which can be pivotal for addressing pressing environmental challenges, protecting human health, and fostering global sustainability efforts in the face of escalating plastic pollution.

       " A detailed understanding of microplastics (MPs) behaviour in freshwater ecosystems is crucial for a proper ecological assessment. This includes the identification of significant transport pathways and net accumulation zones, considering their inherent, and already proven influence on aquatic ecosystems. Bioavailability of toxic agents is significantly influenced by macroinvertebrates' behaviour, such as bioturbation and burrowing, and their prior exposure history. This study investigates the effect of bioturbation activity of Chironomus riparius Meigen, 1804 on the vertical transfer of polyethylene MPs ex-situ. The experimental setup exposes larvae to a scenario of 10× the environmentally relevant high concentration of MPs (80 g m−2). Bioturbation activity was estimated using sediment profile imaging with luminophore tracers. This study demonstrated that spherical MPs are vertically transferred in the sediment due to the bioturbation activity of C. riparius larvae and that their presence influences the intensity of the bioturbation activity over time. The present findings provide a noteworthy contribution to the understanding of the relationship between ecosystem engineers and the dispersion and accumulation of MPs within freshwater ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study aimed to investigate the presence of microplastics in three economically essential shellfish species: green mussels, cockles and spotted babylon. The average abundance of microplastics ranged from 2.41 to 2.84 particles/g wet weight. The predominant shape was fiber, with colors ranging from black-grey to transparent. The size of the microplastics discovered was <1.0 mm. Polystyrene and polyethylene were the most detected types in mussels and cockles, while linen was the predominant type in spotted babylon. The Thai population's estimated annual intake (EAI) of microplastics through shellfish consumption ranged from 20.23 to 1178.42 particles/person/year. The potential human health risks were evaluated using the polymer hazard index (PHI), which led to risk categories III-IV. These findings, along with others from the literature, indicate that shellfish consumption may pose risks to human health, depending on the species consumed and the origin of the specimens. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic particles, measuring <5 mm in size, mainly originate from larger plastic debris undergoing degradation, fragmenting into even smaller fragments. The goal was to analyze the spatial diversity and polymer composition of microplastics (MPs) in North Chennai, South India, aiming to evaluate their prevalence and features like composition, dimensions, color, and shape. In 60 sediment samples, a combined count of 1589 particles were detected, averaging 26 particles per 5 g−1 of dry sediment. The water samples from the North Chennai vicinity encompassed a sum of 1588 particles across 71 samples, with an average of 22 items/L. The majority of MPs ranged in size from 1 mm to 500 μm. The ATR-FTIR results identified the predominant types of MPs as polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene in sediment and water. The spatial variation analysis revealed high MPs concentration in landfill sites, areas with dense populations, and popular tourist destinations. The pollution load index in water demonstrated that MPs had contaminated all stations. Upon evaluating the polymeric and pollution risks, it was evident that they ranged from 5.13 to 430.15 and 2.83 to 15,963.2, which is relatively low to exceedingly high levels. As the quantity of MPs and hazardous polymers increased, the level of pollution and corresponding risks also escalated significantly. The existence of MPs in lake water, as opposed to open well water, could potentially pose a cancer risk for both children and adults who consume it. Detecting MPs in water samples highlights the significance of implementing precautionary actions to alleviate the potential health hazards they create. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic organisms which are found across many ecosystems, including freshwater and marine habitats. They are also found on natural and artificial surfaces. In this study, we cultured and characterise a novel cyanobacterium from the surfaces of foam microplastics of tropical coastal waters. We study the chemical ecology of this cyanobacterium, Sphaerothrix gracilis gen. et sp. nov., together with its potential to form harmful cyanobacterial blooms and bioremediation applications to combat plastic pollution. The genome of S. gracilis spanned 6.7 Mbp, with identification of antibiotic resistance, nitrogen-fixation, plastic-degrading and genes involved in harmful metabolite production. The transport of potentially harmful S. gracilis in coastal environments could have severe implications on human health and food security, especially in times of a cyanobacterial bloom. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging pollutant whose ability to adsorb potentially toxic elements (PTEs) poses a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems, including rivers. In highly developed basins, the abundance of MPs in river sediment is expected to be high, elevating the sedimentary accumulation of PTEs. This hypothesis was tested in the Zayandeh-Rood River, Central Iran, with 21 sediment sampling stations distributed along the entire river stretch. Results of sediment analysis showed significant variations in the abundance and size of MPs, with concentrations ranked as Ba (270.71 mg/kg) > Li (21.29 mg/kg) > Cs (2.50 mg/kg) > Be (1.44 mg/kg) > Sn (1.17 mg/kg) > Mo (1.06 mg/kg) > Ag (0.76 mg/kg), along with sediment physicochemical attributes such as EC, TOC, pH and grain size. MPs were identified in all sediment samples with a mean of 588 items/kg dry weight. Except for Ag, all other PTEs were classified as uncontaminated but exhibited increased enrichment downstream. According to the results of the generalized additive model (maximum R-sq of 0.766), the sedimentary concentration of the majority of PTEs is nonlinearly and positively associated with smaller and more abundant MPs. This study acknowledges that MPs might influence sediment porosity, permeability and structure, thereby directly affecting the settling dynamics of other particles, especially PTEs.

       " Microplastic (MP) contamination is a growing global concern, with lake sediments serving as a significant sink for MP due to both anthropogenic and natural activities. Given the increasing evidence of MP accumulation in sediments, it was crucial to assess their influence on sediment erosion resistance, which directly affected sediment resuspension. To fill this gap, this study focused on the effect of MP on the sediments rheological properties. After 60-day experiments, it was found that MP addition into sediments reduced sediment viscosity, yield stress, and flow point shear stress. Meanwhile, MPs also significantly altered sediment properties and extracellular polymer composition. MP addition reduced extracellular polymeric substances production and cation exchange capacity, which then worked together and led to a weak sediment structure. Seemingly, MPs changed fluid sediment characteristics and caused stronger fluidity under less shear force. Consequently, the accumulation of MP might facilitate the resuspension of sediments under smaller wind and wave disturbances. This study provided novel insights into the direct impact of MPs on sediment physical properties using rheology, thereby enhancing our understanding of the environmental behavior of MPs in lake ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) is a bottom-dwelling elasmobranch that represents the most discarded catch in terms of biomass in the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean). Potential impacts affecting its population and food safety implications have been assessed in three localities along the Catalan coast. Distinct indicators were integrated, such as biological data, ingested anthropogenic items (plastic and cellulose-like items), parasitological indices, trace metal concentrations and histopathology using liver as target organ. Although high ingestion rates of fibres and levels of some heavy metals, they do not seem negatively affected by any major pathology nor by the current levels of pollutants. Small-scale differences among localities and depths were found and discussed. No zoonotic parasites were found. Encysted larvae of Grillotia adenoplusia and, above all, the levels of Hg found in the musculature, that are well over the European Commission limits, rise concerns regarding human consumption of S. canicula in this region. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics, ubiquitous anthropogenic marine pollutants, represent potential threats to coral-Symbiodiniaceae relationships in global reef ecosystems. However, the mechanism underlying the impacts of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on Symbiodiniaceae remains poorly understood. In this study, the cytological, physiological, and microbial responses of Symbiodinium tridacnidorum, a representative Symbiodiniaceae species, to varying concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 5, 50, 100, and 200 mg L−1) were investigated. The results revealed that microplastic exposure inhibited cell division, resulting in reduced cell density compared to control group. Furthermore, algal photosynthetic activity, as indicated by chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm, and net photosynthetic rate, declined with increasing microplastic concentration up to 50 mg L−1. Notably, elevated levels of microplastics (100 and 200 mg L−1) prompted a significant increase in cell size in S. tridacnidorum. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy indicated that hetero-aggregation was formed between high levels of PS-MPs and algal cells, ultimately causing damage to S. tridacnidorum. Moreover, the impact of PS-MPs exposure on the bacterial community associated with S. tridacnidorum was investigated. The results showed a reduction in alpha diversity of the bacterial community in groups exposed to 50, 100, and 200 mg L−1 of microplastics compared to those treated with 0 and 5 mg L−1. Additionally, the relative abundance of Marinobacter, Marivita, and Filomicrobium significantly increased, while Algiphilus and norank Nannocystaceae declined after microplastic exposure. These findings suggest that MPs can inhibit the growth of S. tridacnidorum and alter the associated bacterial community, posing a potential serious threat to coral symbiosis involving S. tridacnidorum. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Mangroves have emerged as one of the ecosystems facing severe threats from microplastic pollution originating from both terrestrial and marine sources. The contamination of mangrove sediment has become a widespread concern, with limited global data on this issue. In this study, surface mangrove sediments (at a depth of 0–5 cm) were collected from six representative mangroves in eastern Thailand to assess microplastic abundance, distribution, and characteristics and conduct an ecological risk assessment. The results revealed that the microplastic concentration in all mangrove sediments had an average abundance of 2213.33 ± 1787.74 items/kg of dry weight. The higher microplastic concentration observed in the Mueang Rayong mangrove (MR) and Laem Chabang mangrove (LB) was primarily attributed to sewage discharge from municipal and industrial areas. These microplastics were predominantly fibers and fragments, measuring less than 1 mm, and exhibited blue and transparent-white colors. They were primarily composed of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), accounting for a significant proportion of all mangrove sites. Assessing the pollution load index (PLI) and ecological risk index (RI), the PLI indicated a hazard level I. At the same time, microplastics posed varying degrees of ecological risk (RI) to all studied mangroves, ranging from high (hazard level III) to extreme danger (hazard level V). Microplastics were found to pose ecological risks within these mangroves, with the LB mangrove showing the highest level of risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are emerging pollutants in the ocean, but their transfer and toxicity along the food chains are unclear. In this study, a marine rotifer (Brachionus plicatilis)-marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) food chain was constructed to evaluate the transfer of polystyrene MPs and NPs (70 nm, 500 nm, and 2 μm, 2000 μg/L) and toxicity of 70 nm PS-NPs (0, 20, 200, and 2000 μg/L) on marine medaka after long-term food chain exposure. The results showed that the amount of 70 nm NPs accumulated in marine medaka was 1.24 μg/mg, which was significantly higher than that of 500 nm NPs (0.87 μg/mg) and 2 μm MP (0.69 μg/mg). Long-term food chain exposure to NPs caused microflora dysbiosis, resulting in activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, which induced liver inflammation. Moreover, NPs food chain exposure increased liver and muscle tissue triglyceride and lactate content, but decreased the protein, sugar, and glycogen content. NPs food chain exposure impaired reproductive function and inhibited offspring early development, which might pose a threat to the sustainability of marine medaka population. Overall, the study revealed the transfer of MPs and NPs and the effects of NPs on marine medaka along the food chain. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This research was conducted from June to August 2023. Data and samples were collected using an exploratory survey method in four locations around the industrial area, namely PT. ASEAN Aceh Fertilizer and PT. Kertas Kraft Aceh in North Aceh Regency, while PT. Pupuk Iskandar Muda and PT. Harun NGL in Lhokseumawe Regency, Indonesia. Observations of physico-chemical parameters including measurements of salinity, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate, total alkalinity, and total ammonia were analyzed in the Laboratory of PT Intraco Agroindustri, Langkat Regency, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Microplastic analysis was carried out at the Faculty of Marine and Fisheries, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. The biological parameters measured in this research include the chlorophyll concentration in the water locations observed. Based on the results of the analysis, it shows that the calcium, magnesium, orthophosphate content at the four research locations has exceeded the quality standards, while the nitrate content is only at PT. ASEAN Aceh Fertilizer and PT. Kertas Kraft Aceh that exceeds the quality standards. The bicarbonate, nitrite, salinity, total alkalinity, and total ammonia content at the four research locations were under normal conditions. The chlorophyll content in the four research locations was categorized as low fertility (oligotrophic). Based on the analysis, it also shows that the four research locations were contaminated with microplastics with a range of 2.78–5.49 particles/l. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) is a global challenge that negatively affects marine environment through plastic pollution and continued capture of marine animals, so-called “ghost fishing”. In different pot fisheries, ghost fishing related to ALDFG is of concern, including pot fishery targeting swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). This study quantified the ghost fishing efficiency by comparing it to the catch efficiency of actively fished pots of the commercial fishery. The results showed that the ghost fishing affects both target and bycatch species. On average, the ghost fishing pots captured 12.53 % (confidence intervals: 10.45 %–15.00 %) undersized crab and 15.70 % (confidence intervals: 12.08 %–20.74 %) legal-sized crab compared to the actively fished pots. Few individuals of several bycatch species were also captured by ghost fishing pots. The results of this study emphasized the need to develop new management strategies for reducing marine pollution by ALDFG and associated negative effects in this pot fishery. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Developing an efficient photocatalyst with good recyclability is vital for the sustainability and affordability of photocatalytic technology in the treatment of wastewater. This work demonstrates a facile route for realizing robust TiO2@Ti3C2Tx fibers with exceptional photocatalytic capability and recyclability. In this route, an alkalization/de-alkalization process was developed to treat a concentrated Ti3C2Tx suspension known as MXene sediment, followed by a wet spinning process. The pretreatment of Ti3C2Tx suspensions promoted the expansion of the d-spacing of stacked Ti3C2Tx layers in the microfibers. It was found that this was beneficial for increasing the population of TiO2 nanoparticles grown from Ti3C2Tx layers. The calcination of these fibers was systematically investigated to optimize the photocatalytic performance of TiO2@Ti3C2Tx fibers. Thanks to the TiO2 nanoparticles, the resulting fibrous photocatalysts not only enabled the fast degradation of RhB dyes but also exhibited excellent recoverability from water. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Over the past decade, global reports have shown a rise in the harmful effects of microplastics (MPs) on marine fish. This study analysed marine species' biochemical biomarker responses to microplastic exposure, finding that MPs can induce oxidative stress in marine fish through meta-regression results. Overall, exposure to MPs resulted in the activation of antioxidant defence mechanisms, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase, detoxification enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase, the detection of malondialdehyde, and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, results highlight oxidative stress biomarkers were activated in wild species that had ingested MPs, indicating potential harm to marine fish, as confirmed in experimental studies. Furthermore, even though MPs’ exposure is better regulated in an experimental setting, it is challenging to replicate actual exposure and environmental factors. The study's findings show the need for more investigation into the hazardous consequences of exposure to environmental MPs on species surveyed in the maritime environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " To explore contaminant concerns as a result of anthropogenic disturbance of the river system, this study provided the first extensive investigation of the contamination profiles, possible driving factors, and ecological risks of 40 target compounds including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), neonicotinoid pesticides (NNIs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sediments of the whole Yangtze River (the world's third longest river). Among these target compounds, PPCPs were the dominant contaminants with a total concentration (∑15PPCPs) of 2.13–14.99 ng/g, followed by ∑7PCBs (<LOD-1.97 ng/g), ∑11NNIs (<LOD-1.18 ng/g), and ∑7PBDEs (<LOD-0.78 ng/g). The results suggested that contamination levels of these chemicals were largely due to the amount used, low affinity with sediments, and effective management practices. Microplastics and anthropogenic factors (i.e., GDP per capita, population density, and urbanization rate) contributed significantly to PPCPs contamination based on correlation analysis (p < 0.05). The risk assessment suggested that PBDE 99, PBDE 183, E3, PCB 153, and PCB 118 posed relatively high risks when compared with other compounds. Therefore, it is not only necessary to take effective measures to reduce the contamination of legacy POPs, but also to improve the management and treatment of emerging organic chemicals to deal with the threat of them in the Yangtze River Basin. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a research issue on the world agenda. Monitoring studies are essential for MP content in aquatic environments since it is the final accumulation point. The present study focused on MP characterizations in sediment samples taken from 20 different stations on the Çoruh River, the major river in the North East of Türkiye. Accordingly, the potential anthropogenic pollution from settlements near the four stations (2, 15, 18, and 20) exceeding 400 MP kg−1 was estimated. On the other hand, stations (1, 3, 9, 11, and 13) far from settlements with quite low MP abundance were also observed. The polymer structures of the detected MPs are generally PE and PET, and their shapes are mostly fiber. This situation raises suspicion that MPs originate from primary use waste such as water bottles and packaging materials. In general, the fiber MPs are smaller than the fragments because of the river's high water flow rate and the low strength of the fiber MPs. In light of these results, the current monitoring data in the region will create awareness and guidance regarding MP pollution in settlements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Recently, there has been a notable rise in social and scientific interest regarding microplastic pollution in coasts where waves significantly influence flow patterns and material transport. This study explores typical short-term movement of buoyant microplastics driven by surf zone processes including wave transformation, breaking, and orbital motion. To track microplastics, Lagrangian Particle Tracking Model (PTM) coupled with Eulerian wave-current interaction model appropriate for coastal hydrodynamics was used. From the simulations, several important findings were observed. (i) In alongshore uniform beaches, lighter and larger buoyant microplastics tended to reach beach more readily. (ii) Accurate predictions of microplastic transport in the surf zone required the consideration of wave breaking. (iii) In alongshore non-uniform coastal bathymetry, rip-currents can send buoyant microplastics offshore, beyond the surf zone. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic debris accumulating on beaches pose a major threat to marine ecosystems. Unexpected events affecting human operations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted governments to implement safety measures and restrictions, can serve as an unplanned investigation of anthropogenic pressure on the marine environment. This study aimed to explore deviations in macroplastic delivery rates to the central eastern Red Sea shoreline during three distinct population mobility periods: before, during, and after COVID-19 restrictions, spanning from January 2019 to June 2022. We observed a 50 % reduction in the estimated macroplastic delivery rates during the lockdown, followed by a 25 % increase after restrictions were eased. Seasonal variations in delivery rates were also observed, with higher values during the winter monsoon. Reduced shoreline litter delivery during the pandemic highlights human operations as a cause of macroplastic litter and suggests the potential of temporary measures to reduce plastic pollution in the coastal environment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Plastic waste is a growing global pollutant. Plastic degradation by microorganisms has captured attention as an earth-friendly tactic. Although the mechanisms of plastic degradation by bacteria, fungi, and algae have been explored over the past decade, a large knowledge gap still exists regarding the identification, sorting, and cultivation of efficient plastic degraders, primarily because of their uncultivability. Advances in sequencing techniques and bioinformatics have enabled the identification of microbial degraders and related enzymes and genes involved in plastic biodegradation. In this review, we provide an outline of the situation of plastic degradation and summarize the methods for effective microbial identification using multidisciplinary techniques such as multiomics, meta-analysis, and spectroscopy. This review introduces new strategies for controlling plastic pollution in an environmentally friendly manner. Using this information, highly efficient and colonizing plastic degraders can be mined via targeted sorting and cultivation. In addition, based on the recognized rules and plastic degraders, we can perform an in-depth analysis of the associated degradation mechanism, metabolic features, and interactions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In the present study, the northwest coast of India, bordering the Arabian Sea, was selected to evaluate the microplastic (MP) abundance. This is the first study to emphasize the effects of different seasons on MP distribution. The collected MPs were dried, segregated, and evaluated based on their morphotype, size, color, and polymer type. A total of 1756.6, 7326.6, and 202 particles/kg of sand were estimated in the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively, with a dominance of polypropylene (PP) type of plastic in the pre-monsoon and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. HDPE and PP collected MPs during the monsoon season were further characterized for associated contaminants. Metal absorbance was detected using SEM-EDX mapping and ICP-MS. The presence of organic compounds (OCs) was analyzed using GC-MS. MPs exhibit distinct associations with metals, among which the HDPE pellet morphotype exhibits a higher range of metal adsorption. Total 61 different OCs were associated with MPs. The HDPE pellets contained the highest amounts of hydrophobic organic compounds. PP pellets were found to contain triglycerides, fatty aldehydes, and alkaloids, along with HOCs. Among morphotypes, pellet forms of MPs were found to adsorb more contaminants. These co-contaminants infiltrate the study area through sewage runoff and shoreline debris deposition, subsequently interacting with MPs. Furthermore, the MP diversity was studied by employing the MP diversity integrated index, which suggests that most of the MP diversity was observed in the pre-monsoon period. The pollution load index employed an MP risk assessment, which presented a low degree of MP contamination. In contrast, the polymer hazard index was calculated as 21650.3 in post-monsoon, placing the area under the extreme danger category. It is evident from the data that the types of MP is more important than their number. Thus, MP morphotypes have importance in the adsorption of co-contaminants. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The increasing problem of micro-nano plastic pollution in Egypt's coastal areas is a global threat to marine ecosystems. This study investigated an environmentally friendly bioremediation approach to tackle this issue, specifically looking at the identification and application of lipolytic bacteria found in plastic-polluted regions for breaking down nanoplastics. One of the seven bacterial strains examined showed an exceptional efficacy in degrading nanoplastics. This strain was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and was recorded in the NCBI database with an accession number of PP087224. The strain was analyzed using a p-nitrophenyl palmitate assay to quantify its lipase production when exposed to different nanoplastics, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The results showed notable differences in enzyme activity depending on the polymer type. The strain exhibited the highest lipase activity with polyethylene (142± 2U/ µL), followed by polystyrene (83± 1.4U/ µL), and the lowest activity was observed with polyethylene terephthalate (22± 2U/ µL) compared to the control. The study showed that the bacterial reaction to nanoplastic pollution differs depending on the polymer type. Scanning electron microscopy verified a 97% decrease in nanoplastic sizes and chemical structural changes. This was validated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray differential (XRD) analysis, which showed modifications in the polymer's chemical structure and crystallinity. The research introduced a viable approach for nanoplastic remediation using particular bacterial strain and their enzymes, providing a new solution to the urgent problem of marine nanoplastic pollution utilizing the capabilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa O6. © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

       " Microplastics (MPs) are a serious threat in freshwater environments. The ecological risk and abundance level of MPs in abiotic and biotic compartments of the Nile River haven't been systematically reported. Thus, these issues were highlighted in the present study during different seasons of the sampling year. The results showed that MP concentrations in the river ranged from 2.24 ± 0.6 to 3.76 ± 1.1 particles/L, 298 ± 63 to 520 ± 80 particles/kg dry weight, and 0.081 ± 0.051 to 4.95 ± 2.6 particles/individual in surface water, sediment, and different species of aquatic insects, respectively. All the extracted MPs are colored blue, red, and black. Fiber-shaped polyesters (<500–1500 μm) were the most common MPs in all the river compartments. MPs' dominance was observed during the summer in comparison with that in the other seasons. Environmental risk indicators indicate the high ecological risk of MPs, which are widely distributed in the Nile River. In conclusion, MP consumption by aquatic insects may not only be related to levels of environmental contamination, since other variables, such as taxon size, weight, and particular feeding behavior, may also be significant. Additionally, the presence of MPs in insects (at lower trophic levels) creates the potential for predation-based inter-trophic level transmission. Thus, higher trophic-level investigations of various feeding groups should be carried out to identify any possible harm that MPs cause to various aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The inaugural microplastic study on Indian lakes, conducted in 2017, marked a significant milestone in addressing the emerging issue of microplastic pollution. Despite the early recognition of microplastics in oceans since the 1970s, our knowledge cutoff reveals that only 12 Indian lakes have been investigated for microplastic contamination. Given the vulnerability of lacustrine ecosystems to pollution, they may face challenges akin to those observed in marine environments. While the contamination of oceans has received considerable attention, the impact on freshwater ecosystems and lakes is increasingly recognized. However, the relatively nascent nature of this field has led to methodological diversity, posing challenges for standardization. This review focuses on three key aspects: (1) assessing microplastic contamination in 12 Indian lakes; (2) exploring methodologies across various compartments, including surface water, sediments, and biota; and (3) examining microplastic characteristics and sources. The analysis concludes with recommendations to guide decision-making by public authorities and foster consensus among research teams in this critical field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " The loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) has been suggested as a bio-indicator species for plastic pollution. However, detailed investigations in the eastern Mediterranean are limited. Here, we present data from loggerhead turtles (2012-2022; n = 131) of which 42.7 % (n = 57) had ingested macroplastic (pieces ≥ 5 mm). Frequency of occurrence (%) was not found to have changed over time, with body size (CCL cm), between stranded or bycaught turtles, or with levels of digesta present. The characteristics of ingested plastic (n = 492) were largely sheetlike (62 %), clear (41 %) or white (25 %) and the most common polymers identified were Polypropylene (37 %) and Polyethylene (35 %). Strong selectivity was displayed towards certain types, colours and shapes. Data are also presented for posthatchling turtles (n = 4), an understudied life stage. Much larger sample sizes will be needed for this species to be an effective bio-indicator, with the consideration of monitoring green turtles (Chelonia mydas) for the eastern Mediterranean recommended allowing a more holistic picture to be gathered. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The potential of using organisms as bioindicators of marine litter has been an area of general interest in multiple scientific and monitoring programs across the globe. Procellariiformes seabirds are particularly vulnerable to plastic contamination, which makes them a research focus group. This study investigated plastic ingestion in deceased fledglings and adults Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) collected over eight years (2015 to 2022) at two Atlantic archipelagos: the Azores and the Canaries. Necropsies were carried out in a total of 1,238 individuals showing a high prevalence of plastic ingestion (90%), with approximately 80% of items recovered from the gizzard. Fledglings carried greater plastic loads compared to adults, yet plastic morphologies were similar between both age classes. The temporal analyses conducted with generalised additive mixed-effect models revealed a distinct temporal trend in plastic numbers, but not in terms of plastic mass. In addition, the spatial analyses showed that Cory's shearwaters from the Canary Islands ingest a higher quantity of plastic and a greater proportion of threadlike items than the Azorean birds. These results suggest higher contamination at the NW Africa foraging grounds next to the Canaries and highlight fisheries as a potential source of marine litter in that region. On the other hand, the information gathered from the Azorean birds suggests they would be able to monitor changes in the composition of the plastic items floating in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. Overall, our outcomes support the use of Cory's shearwater fledglings that are victims of light pollution as a key bioindicator of plastic contamination in the North Atlantic. For its policy application, the presented threshold value in combination with the assessment method will enable effective tracking of floating plastic litter in the framework of the MSFD and OSPAR. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " The present work aims to evaluate the MP contamination of zooplankton and its impact on MP trophic transfers at the lower levels of the food web in a field study. During 1 year, seasonal surveys were conducted to collect zooplankton and water samples from different sites in two estuaries, the Douro and Lima estuaries (NW, Portugal). The zooplankton was quantified and identified into major zooplanktonic groups. Dedicated protocols that had been previously optimized were used to assess the MP presence in the water samples and in two of the most abundant zooplankton groups (copepods and chaetognaths). The results showed the presence of MPs in all water samples, with similar MP concentrations in both estuaries (Lima: 2.4 ± 2.0 MPs m−3; Douro: 2.3 ± 1.9 MPs m−3). In general, no temporal or spatial variations were observed. Fibres, blue and of a small size (<1 mm), were the most common characteristics of the MPs found in the water and zooplankton, indicating that water can be a source of MPs for zooplankton. Chaetognatha exhibited higher MP contamination in the Lima (2.9 ± 3.1 MPs ind−1) and Douro (2.0 ± 2.8 MPs ind−1) estuaries than Copepoda, which tended to have lower levels of MP contamination (Lima: 0.95 ± 1.12 MPs ind−1; Douro: 1.1 ± 1.2 MPs ind−1). Such differences in the MP concentrations between these two categories of zooplanktonic organisms indicate a possible MP trophic transfer at the lower levels of the food web. The results highlight the novel possibility of an MP trophic transfer in zooplankton and the need to fully assess the impacts of MPs in real scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a routine thermoanalytical method in material science, is gaining utility in plastic pollution research to improve polymer identification. We optimized a DSC method, experimentally testing pan types, temperature ramps, number of melts, and minimum sample masses. Using the optimized method, we created an in-house thermogram library from 201 polymer reference standards. We determined peak melting temperature cutoffs for differentiating variants of PE and nylon. PE cutoffs remained stable after experimentally weathering standards outdoors or for severely weathered HDPE debris found on Hawaii's beaches. Marine debris samples, across a range of weathering severity and previously identified as either low-density or high-density polyethylene (LDPE or HDPE) based on the 1377 cm−1 peak indicating methyl groups by attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), were analyzed by DSC to confirm or challenge the ATR-FTIR PE differentiation. ATR-FTIR was correct for >80% of the HDPE samples, but <40% of those initially identified as LDPE by ATR-FTIR. Accuracy did not relate to weathering extent. Most samples mis-identified as LDPE were HDPE that had formed methyl groups likely from chain scission during photooxidation. ATR-FTIR alone is unreliable for differentiating weathered PE, DSC is required. We provide a multiple-method workflow for complete and accurate polymer identification, even for microplastics ≥0.03 mg. Applying these methods can better identify the polymer composition of marine debris, essential for sourcing and recycling efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The Canary Archipelago is a group of volcanic islands located in the North Atlantic Ocean with high marine biodiversity. This archipelago intercepts the Canary Current, the easternmost branch of the Azores Current in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, which brings large amounts of litter from remote sources via oceanic transportation. It is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to marine plastic pollution. Here, we present a review of the available studies on mesoplastics and microplastics in the Canary Islands over the last decade to evaluate the level and distribution of plastic pollution in this archipelago. Specifically, we focused on data from beaches and surface waters to assess the pollution level among the different islands as well as between windward and leeward zones, and the main characteristics (size, type, colour, and polymer) of the plastics found in the Canary Islands. The concentrations of meso- and MPs on beaches ranged from 1.5 to 2972 items/m2 with a mean of 381 ± 721 items/m2. The concentration of MPs (>200 μm) in surface waters was highly variable with mean values of 998 × 103 ± 3364 × 103 items/km2 and 10 ± 31 items/m3. Plastic pollution in windward beaches was one order of magnitude significantly higher than in leeward beaches. The accumulation of MPs in surface waters was higher in the leeward zones of the high-elevation islands, corresponding to the Special Areas of Conservation (ZECs) and where the presence of marine litter windrows (MLW) has been reported. Microplastic fragments of polyethylene of the colour category “white/clear/uncoloured” were the most common type of plastic reported in both beaches and surface waters. More studies on the occurrence of MLW in ZECS and plastic pollution in the water column and sediments, including small-size fractions (<200 μm), are needed to better assess the level of plastic pollution and its fate in the Canary Islands. Overall, this review confirms that the Canary Archipelago is a hotspot of oceanic plastic pollution, with concentrations of MPs in surface waters in the highest range reported for oceanic islands and one of the highest recorded mean concentrations of beached meso- and microplastics in the world. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastic pollution and ongoing climatic changes exert considerable pressure on coastal ecosystems. Unravelling the combined effects of these two threats is essential to management and conservation actions to reduce the overall environmental risks. We assessed the capacity of a coastal ecosystem engineer, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, to cope with various levels of aerial heat stress (20, 25, 30 and 35°C) after an exposure to substances leached from beached and virgin low-density polyethylene pellets. Our results revealed a significant interaction between temperature and plastic leachates on mussel survival rates. Specifically, microplastic leachates had no effect on mussel survival at 20, 25 and 30°C. In turn, mussel survival rates significantly decreased at 35°C, and this decrease was even more significant following an exposure to leachates from beached pellets; these pellets had a higher concentration of additives compared to the virgin ones, potentially causing a bioenergetic imbalance. Our results stress the importance of adopting integrated approaches combining the effects of multiple environmental threats on key marine species to understand and mitigate their potential synergistic effects on ecosystem dynamics and resilience in the face of the changing environment.  © 2024 The Author(s).,\n",
       " The leaching of additives from plastics and elastomers (rubbers) has raised concerns due to their potential negative impacts on the environment and the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemicals extracted from two types of rubber on microbiomes derived from a benthic sea urchin and two pelagic fish species. Additionally, we examined whether bacterial communities preconditioned with rubber-associated chemicals displayed adaptations to antibiotics. At the highest tested concentrations of chemicals, we observed reduced maximum growth rates and yields, prolonged lag phases, and increased alpha diversity. While the effects on alpha and beta diversity were not always conclusive, several bacterial genera were significantly influenced by chemicals from the two rubber sources. Subsequent exposure of sea urchin microbiomes preconditioned with rubber chemicals to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin resulted in decreased maximum growth rates. This indicates a more sensitive microbiome to ciprofloxacin when preconditioned with rubber chemicals. Although no significant interaction effects between rubber chemicals and ciprofloxacin exposure were observed in bacterial alpha and beta diversity, we observed log-fold changes in two bacterial genera in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. These findings highlight the structural and functional alterations in microbiomes originating from various marine species when exposed to rubber-associated chemicals and underscore the potential risks posed to marine life. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study aimed to assess microplastics (MPs) in the digestive glands of Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels. Mussels were collected from pristine, aquaculture, and port areas of the northern Adriatic Sea (Slovenia and Croatia coastline). MPs were detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The characterized MPs were further categorized based on their shape, size, and color. The highest number of 32.85 ± 27.98 MPs per mussel digestive gland was found in the mussels sampled from the ACI marina Rovinj (Croatia). The predominant MPs found in the mussel digestive glands at all investigated locations belonged to the smallest analyzed category (5–10 μm in size) and exhibited spherical and fragment shapes. The most abundant MPs found in mussels by color were white particles. MPs were found in both wild and farmed mussels and, hence, the results point out that the abundance of microplastic pollution is omnipresent along the coastal waters of the northern Adriatic Sea. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastic mixtures are ubiquitously distributed in global ecosystems and include varying types. However, it remains unknown how microplastic diversity affects the biotic interactions of microbes. Here, we developed novel experiments of 600 microcosms with microplastic diversity ranging from 1 to 6 types and examined ecological networks for microbial communities in lake sediments after 2 months of incubation at 15 and 20 °C. We found that microplastic diversity generally enhanced the complexity of microbial networks at both temperatures, such as increasing network connectance and reducing average path length. This phenomenon was further confirmed by strengthened species interactions toward high microplastic diversity except for the negative interactions at 15 °C. Interestingly, increasing temperatures further exaggerated the effects of microplastic diversity on network structures, resulting in higher network connectivity and species interactions. Consistently, using species extinction simulations, we found that higher microplastic diversity and temperature led to more robust networks, and their effects were additionally and positively mediated by the presence of biodegradable microplastics. Our findings provide the first evidence that increasing microplastic diversity could unexpectedly promote the complexity and stability of microbial networks and that future warming could amplify this effect. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution is an increasing threat to coral reefs, which are already strongly challenged by climate change-related heat stress. Although it is known that scleractinian corals can ingest microplastic, little is known about their egestion and how microplastic exposure may impair corals at physiological and cellular levels. In addition, the effects of microplastic pollution at current environmental concentration have been little investigated to date, particularly in corals already impacted by heat stress. In this study, the combined effects of these environmental threats on Pocillopora damicornis were investigated from a physical and cellular perspective. Colonies were exposed to three concentrations of polyethylene microplastic beads (no microplastic beads: [No MP], 1 mg/L: [Low MP]; 10 mg/L: [High MP]), and two different temperatures (25 °C and 30 °C) for 72 h. No visual signs of stress in corals, such as abnormal mucus production and polyp extroflection, were recorded. At [Low MP], beads adhered to colonies were ingested but were also egested. Moreover, thermally stressed colonies showed a lower adhesion and higher egestion of microplastic beads. Coral bleaching was observed with an increase in temperature and microplastic bead concentration, as indicated by a general decrease in chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodiniaceae density. An increase in lipid peroxidation was measured in colonies exposed to [Low MP] and [High MP] and an up-regulation of stress response gene hsp70 was observed due to the synergistic interaction of both stressors. Overall, our findings showed that heat stress still represents the main threat to P. damicornis, while the effect of microplastics on coral health and physiology may be minor, especially at control temperature. However, microplastics could exacerbate the effect of thermal stress on cellular homeostasis, even at [Low MP]. While reducing ocean warming is critical for preserving coral reefs, effective management of emerging threats like microplastic pollution is equally essential. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " There remain significant gaps in knowledge about ‘sub-lethal’ impacts of plastic ingestion, particularly chronic impacts on cells, tissues, or organs. Few studies have applied traditional animal health tools, such as histopathology, to assess physiological damage to wildlife, with fewer still providing information on the dosage or exposure to plastics needed to elicit negative effects. Our study seeks to investigate a common hypothesis in plastic pollution research; that an increasing plastics burden will have an impact on an animal's health, examining two wild species with high levels of environmental exposure to plastic through their diet. Here we assess the histopathology of the muscle, upper digestive tract, liver and kidney of two seabird species that are known to be commonly exposed to plastic, comparing exposed and non-exposed individuals. Fledgling seabirds showed histopathological evidence of cumulative pressures such as starvation, disease, and endoparasite burden. However, we observed no evidence of chronic harm that could be explicitly linked to the plastics. We found one case of haemorrhage, reaffirming that large/sharp plastic foreign bodies may cause acute physical damage. Given the numerous interacting pressures on the health of fledging seabirds, including exposure to plastic, this study highlights the need to scrutinise plastic-animal interactions and research though a One Health lens. © 2023 The Authors,\n",
       " The capacity of microplastics to harbor and propagate bacteria has been the focus of attention over the last decade. Such microplastic-supported bacterial colonization behavior in the municipal sewer system could be a critical ecological link influencing the biogeochemical activities and risks in receiving waters in urban areas, given the alarming microplastic loads discharged there. This study conducted a large-scale survey covering a wide range of residential and industrial catchments in Shanghai, China. We aimed to assess the microplastic prevalence and bacterial colonization patterns in different sewer habitats and to explore the role of land use, stratified wastewater and sediment, and microplastic attributes in shaping the patterns. We found that the sewer system formed a temporal but pronounced microplastic pool, with land use playing a significant role in the variability of microplastic prevalence. Industrial sewers contained a high abundance of microplastics with large particle sizes, diverse polymer compositions, and shapes. However, while there was a spatial discrepancy between urban and suburban areas in the abundance of microplastics in residential sewers, their predominant polymer and shape types were simple, i.e., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and fibers. Sewer habitat characteristics, particularly the stratified wastewater and sediment determined microbial colonization patterns. The latter acted as a long-term sink for microplastics and supported the high growth of colonizers. In contrast, the wastewater plastisphere presented novel niches, hosting communities with a marked proportion of unique bacterial genera after colonization. Besides, statistics showed a highly positive and dense co-occurrence network of the plastisphere communities, especially those from the industrial sewer sediment, with enhanced metabolic activity, cellular processes and systems, and increased human pathogenic potential. Findings indicated a coarse and uncertain effect of the selective pressure of microplastic attributes on plastisphere community structure differentiation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The distributions and toxicities of the pollutants benzothiazoles (BTHs), benzotriazoles (BTRs), and benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers (BUVs) have attracted much attention, but most research has focused on freshwater environments and few have examined their levels in marine environments. This study, for the first time, investigated the spatial and temporal variability and ecological risks of BTHs, BTRs and BUVs in the Yangtze River estuary and its adjacent area, and further elucidated how environmental factors influence the transport of these contaminants. The concentrations of BTHs, BTRs, and BUVs in seawater showed significant seasonal variability, with the highest concentrations in summer, followed by autumn, and then winter-spring. The spatiotemporal variability in BTHs, BTRs and BUVs in the seawater and sediments samples showed decreasing trends from nearshore to offshore, reflecting the influence of river discharge. Marine debris and continuous discharge from cities were responsible for the high detection frequency of these contaminants in the YRE and its adjacent area. Furthermore, the moderate risk from the presence of BTHs, BTRs, and BUVs as they accumulate in sediments should not be ignored. Our study provides new insights into the fate and ecological risk of BTHs, BTRs, and BUVs in the estuary. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) composed of different polymers with various shapes, within a vast granulometric distribution (1 μm - 5 mm) and with a wide variety of physicochemical surface and bulk characteristics spiral around the globe, with different atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, and terrestrial residence times, while interacting with other pollutants and biota. The challenges of microplastic pollution are related to the complex relationships between the microplastic generation mechanisms (physical, chemical, and biological), their physicochemical properties, their interactions with other pollutants and microorganisms, the changes in their properties with aging, and their small sizes that facilitate their diffusion and transportation between the air, water, land, and biota, thereby promoting their ubiquity. Early career researchers (ERCs) constitute an essential part of the scientific community committed to overcoming the challenges of microplastic pollution with their new ideas and innovative scientific perspectives for the development of remediation technologies. However, because of the enormous amount of scientific information available, it may be difficult for ERCs to determine the complexity of this environmental issue. This mini-review aims to provide a quick and updated overview of the essential insights of microplastic pollution to ERCs to help them acquire the background needed to develop highly innovative physical, chemical, and biological remediation technologies, as well as valorization proposals and environmental education and awareness campaigns. Moreover, the recommendations for the development of holistic microplastic pollution remediation strategies presented here can help ERCs propose technologies considering the environmental, social, and practical dimensions of microplastic pollution while fulfilling the current government policies to manage this plastic waste. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Aim: The prevalence of plastic particles has become a global crisis for the environment pollution and human life. This study aimed to investigate the contamination of microplastics (MPs) in marine environments and to determine the relationships between MPs pollution and types of land use. Methodology: Two invertebrate species (Anadara granosa and Litopenaeus vannamei) and sediment samples were collected for the analysis of MPs accumulation in the Chanthaburi estuarine ecosystem. The microplastics contamination and pollution were determined with visual identification and environmental index, respectively. The abundance and the land use type of MPs in Chanthaburi Province were compared by a Geographic Information System (GIS). Results: The MPs contamination in the white shrimps were higher than the cockles. The black filamentous type of MPs was a major characteristic which ranged between 0.43-0.85 mm, 0.45-0.65 mm and 1.25 - 3.05 mm in A. granosa, L. vannamei and sediment, respectively. The MPs pollution index (PLI and BCF) showed low levels in the hazardous category. The Chanthaburi land use analysis showed variation in the land use change and a strong correlation between green areas and the MPs contamination. Interpretation: The statistical analysis suggested differences between MPs abundance in our samples.The utilization of agriculture and forest land use types could relieve the impact of MPs accumulation.This study also demonstrated the need for managing MPs pollution in Thai marine ecosystems. © 2024 Triveni Enterprises.

       " Microplastic pollution in freshwater environments has received increasing attention. However, limited research on the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in plateau lakes. This study investigated the microplastic characteristics and influencing factors in lakes with different land cover types on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. Results showed that microplastic abundance ranged from 0.5 to 12.6 items/L in water and 50–325 items/kg in sediments. Microplastics in water were predominantly polypropylene (50.5%), fragments (40.5%), and 50–200 µm (66.7%). High-density (27.9%), fibrous (69.3%), and large-sized microplastics (47.7%) were retained primarily in lake sediments. The highest microplastic abundance in water was found in cropland lakes and grassland lakes, while that in sediments was in descending order of desert lakes > cropland lakes > grassland lakes > forest-grassland lakes. Differences among lake types suggest that agriculture, tourism, and atmospheric transport may be critical microplastic sources. Microplastic distribution was positively correlated with farmland and artificial surface coverage, showing that land cover types related to human activities could exacerbate microplastic pollution in lakes. Redundancy analysis showed that ammonia nitrogen and pH were the key physicochemical factors affecting microplastic distribution in lakes, indicating the potential sources of microplastics in lakes and the uniqueness of microplastic occurrence characteristics in desert saline-alkaline lakes, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics, pervasive environmental pollutants, are found across various ecosystems, including small inland water bodies. They are reported in different environmental media, yet little is known about the mutual relationships of microplastics’ properties across components of small inland water bodies. Here, having extracted and analyzed these particles from water, sediment, and amphibian larvae from 23 sites, we test within-site similarities regarding shape (morphological type), color, and chemical composition (polymer type). We also provide a brief characterization of the microplastics extracted from water and sediment regarding these parameters. We observed a statistically significant similarity of microplastics’ shapes and colors between those extracted from water and amphibian larvae. Such a similarity, though less pronounced, was also found between amphibian larvae and sediment. However, the chemical composition (polymer type) of the microplastics from water, sediment, and amphibian larvae did not exhibit any similarities beyond what would be expected by chance. The observed congruence in the colors and shapes of microplastics between amphibian larvae and their corresponding aquatic habitats underscores the profound interconnectedness among the constituents of freshwater ecosystems. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Coastal areas are prone to plastic accumulation due to their proximity to land based sources. Coastal vegetated habitats (e.g., seagrasses, saltmarshes, mangroves) provide a myriad of ecosystem functions, such as erosion protection, habitat refuge, and carbon storage. The biological and physical factors that underlie these functions may provide an additional benefit: trapping of marine microplastics. While microplastics occurrence in coastal vegetated sediments is well documented, there is conflicting evidence on whether the presence of vegetation enhances microplastics trapping relative to bare sites and the factors that influence microplastic trapping remain understudied. We investigated how vegetation structure and microplastic type influences trapping in a simulated coastal wetland. Through a flume experiment, we measured the efficiency of microplastic trapping in the presence of branched and grassy vegetation and tested an array of microplastics that differ in shape, size, and polymer. We observed that the presence of vegetation did not affect the number of microplastics trapped but did affect location of deposition. Microplastic shape, rather than polymer, was the dominant factor in determining whether microplastics were retained in the sediment or adhered to the vegetation canopy. Across the canopy, microfibre concentrations decreased from the leading edge to the interior which suggests that even on a small-scale, vegetation has a filtering effect. The outcome of this study enriches our understanding of coastal vegetation as a microplastics sink and that differences among microplastics informs where they are most likely to accumulate within a biogenic canopy. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The detrimental effects of plastic and microplastic accumulation on ecosystems are widely recognized and indisputable. The emergence of biodegradable plastics (BPs) offers a practical solution to plastic pollution. Problematically, however, not all BPs can be fully degraded in the environment. On the contrary, the scientific community has demonstrated that BPs are more likely than conventional plastics (CPs) to degrade into micro/nanoplastics and release additives, which can have similar or even worse effects than microplastics. However, there is very limited information available on the environmental toxicity assessment of BMPs. The absence of a toxicity evaluation system and the uncertainty regarding combined toxicity with other pollutants also impede the environmental toxicity assessment of BMPs. Currently, research is focused on thoroughly exploring the toxic effects of biodegradable microplastics (BMPs). This paper reviews the pollution status of BMPs in the environment, the degradation behavior of BPs and the influencing factors. This paper comprehensively summarizes the ecotoxicological effects of BPs on ecosystems, considering animals, plants, and microorganisms in various environments such as water bodies, soil, and sediment. The focus is on distinguishing between BMPs and conventional microplastics (CMPs). In addition, the combined toxic effects of BMPs and other pollutants are also being investigated. The findings suggest that BMPs may have different or more severe impacts on ecosystems. The rougher and more intricate surface of BMPs increases the likelihood of causing mechanical damage to organisms and breaking down into smaller plastic particles, releasing additives that lead to a series of cascading negative effects on related organisms and ecosystems. In the case of knowledge gaps, future research is also proposed and anticipated to investigate the toxic effects of BMPs and their evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Over the past decade or so, microplastics (MPs) have received increasing attention due to their ubiquity and potential risk to the environment. Waste plastics usually end up in landfills. These plastics in landfills undergo physical compression, chemical oxidation, and biological decomposition, breaking down into MPs. As a result, landfill leachate stores large amounts of MPs, which can negatively impact the surrounding soil and water environment. However, not enough attention has been given to the occurrence and removal of MPs in landfill leachate. This lack of knowledge has led to landfills being an underestimated source of microplastics. In order to fill this knowledge gap, this paper collects relevant literature on MPs in landfill leachate from domestic and international sources, systematically summarizes their presence within Asia and Europe, assesses the impacts of landfill leachate on MPs in the adjacent environment, and particularly discusses the possible ecotoxicological effects of MPs in leachate. We found high levels of MPs in the soil and water around informal landfills, and the MPs themselves and the toxic substances they carry can have toxic effects on organisms. In addition, this paper summarizes the potential impact of MPs on the biochemical treatment stage of leachate, finds that the effects of MPs on the biochemical treatment stage and membrane filtration are more significant, and proposes some novel processes for MPs removal from leachate. This analysis contributes to the removal of MPs from leachate. This study is the first comprehensive review of the occurrence, environmental impact, and removal of MPs in leachate from landfills in Asia and Europe. It offers a comprehensive theoretical reference for the field, providing invaluable insights. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " In the context of global environmental change, this study presents a novel approach to evaluating microplastic (MP) fluxes and probabilities of pollution within marine food webs. A topological model was built to understand the dynamics of MP pollution in the Mediterranean food webs. The analysis involves two approaches: the first approach includes centrality measures to understand the key role of species in the transmission of trophic effects regarding MPs, and the second approach incorporates MP data by developing the Interaction Pollution Indices (IPIs) at multiple levels to identify species being sources and receptors of MP pollution in the new concept of a plastic-food web. The trophic network consisted of 356 nodes representing not only species, but also aggregations in higher taxa, for a total of 3517 interactions, with 108 species having information on MP frequency of occurrence (FO). The mean probability of dietary MP transference was 0.087 %, and the maximum was 18 %. Species such as the rose shrimp A. antennatus, the catshark S. canicula, the sole S. solea, the sardine S. pilchardus, the Norway lobster N. norvegicus, and the forkbeard P. phycis were found to be significant sources of pollution and played crucial roles in the transmission of effects within the network. By incorporating the IPIs, a deeper understanding of the pollution dynamics at multiple levels was gained, highlighting the value of combining feeding and MP pollution data to develop effective management and conservation strategies. The application of the IPIs holds immense potential for studying bioaccumulation and biomagnification through MP pollutant transferences in marine ecosystems. Its flexibility in incorporating different types of information and units enables its transversal application throughout the field of ecology. This research provides a crucial step towards developing effective tools for MP pollution mitigation strategies and the preservation of marine ecosystems integrity. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), a new type of pollutant, have attracted much attention worldwide. MPs are often complexed with other pollutants such as heavy metals, resulting in combined toxicity to organisms in the environment. Studies on the combined toxicity of MPs and heavy metals have usually focused on the marine, while on the freshwater are lacking. In order to understand the combined toxic effects of MPs and heavy metals in the freshwater, five typical MPs (PVC, PE, PP, PS, PET) were selected to investigate the adsorption characteristics of MPs to Pb2+ before and after the MPs aging by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation through static adsorption tests. The results showed that UV aging enhanced adsorption of Pb2+ by MPs. It is noteworthy that MPs-PET had the highest adsorption capacity for Pb2+, and the interaction between MPs-PET and Pb2+ was the strongest. We specifically selected MPs-PET to study its combined toxicity with Pb2+ to Chlorella pyrenoidosa. In the combined toxicity test, MPs-PET and Pb2+ had significant toxic effects on Chlorella pyrenoidosa in the individual exposure, and the toxicity of individual Pb2+ exposure was greater than that of individual MPs-PET exposure. In the combined exposure, when MPs-PET and Pb2+ without adsorption (MPs-PET/Pb2+), MPs-PET and Pb2+ had a synergistic effect, which would produce strong physical and chemical stress on Chlorella pyrenoidosa simultaneously, and the toxic effect was the most significant. After the adsorption of MPs-PET and Pb2+ (MPs-PET@Pb2+), the concentration and activity of Pb2+ decreased due to the adsorption and fixation of MPs-PET, and the chemical stress on Chlorella pyrenoidosa was reduced, but the physical stress of MPs-PET still existed and posed a serious threat to the survival of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. This study has provided a theoretical basis for further assessment of the potential environmental risks of MPs in combination with other pollutants such as heavy metals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Baleen whales are ecosystem sentinels of microplastic pollution. Research indicates that they likely ingest millions of anthropogenic microparticles per day when feeding. Their immense prey consumption and filter-feeding behavior put them at risk. However, the role of baleen, the oral filtering structure of mysticete whales, in this process has not been adequately addressed. Using actual baleen tissue from four whale species (fin, humpback, minke, and North Atlantic right) in flow tank experiments, we tested the capture rate of plastics of varying size, shape, and polymer type, as well as chemical residues leached by degraded plastics, all of which accumulated in the baleen filter. Expanded polystyrene foam was the most readily captured type of plastic, followed by fragments, fibers, nurdles, and spherical microbeads. Nurdle and microbead pellets were captured most readily by right whale baleen, and fragments were captured by humpback baleen. Although not all differences between polymer types were statistically significant, buoyant polymers were most often trapped by baleen. Plastics were captured by baleen sections from all regions of a full baleen rack, but were more readily captured by baleen from dorsal and posterior regions. Baleen–plastic interactions underlie various risks to whales, including filter clogging and damage, which may impede feeding. We posit that plastics pose a higher risk to some whale species due to a combination of factors, including filter porosity, diet, habitat and geographic distribution, and foraging ecology and behavior. Certain whale species in specific marine regions are of the greatest concern due to plastic abundance. It is not feasible to remove all plastic from the sea; most of what is there will continue to break into ever-smaller pieces. We suggest that higher priorities be accorded to lessening humans’ dependence on plastics, restricting entry points of plastics into the ocean, and developing biodegradable alternatives. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in length. As an emerging pollutant, MPs are widely found in the marine and terrestrial environments. It has been found that the terrestrial environment is an important sink for MPs, where the content of MPs is 4 - 23 times higher than the marine environment. Microplastics not only affect the soil environment, but also can enter plant tissues and the human body through food chain or other pathways, posing health risks and becoming an urgent environmental problem. Detection technology is an indispensable tool for the study of environmental pollutants, but research on terrestrial ecosystems is still in its infancy and detection technology for MPs is still developing. At present, the detection of microplastics is ususally done in two steps: sample pretreatment and sample analysis. Density flotation, sieving and filtering, extraction and disintegration methods are commonly used for sample pretreatment, and visual inspection, spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are used for qualitative/quantitative sample analyses with field emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM), Raman spectra (Raman), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) most commonly used. For complex environmental samples combination methods are often required. Thus this paper summarizes research progress on detection methods for MPs in soils and plants, and discusses the application conditions and advantages and disadvantages of different detection techniques, aiming to provide a scientific reference for future studies, qualitative and quantitative, of MPs in terrestrial ecosystems and MPs transfer and accumulation in plants. © 2024 Science Frontiers editorial department.

       " The extensive use of plastics has given rise to microplastics, a novel environmental contaminant that has sparked considerable ecological and environmental concerns. Biodegradation offers a more environmentally friendly approach to eliminating microplastics, but their degradation by marine microbial communities has received little attention. In this study, we used iron-enhanced marine sediment to augment the natural bacterial community and facilitate the decomposition of polyethylene (PE) microplastics. The introduction of iron-enhanced sediment engendered an augmented bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of polyethylene (PE), thereby leading to a more pronounced degradation effect. This novel observation has been ascribed to the oxidative stress-induced generation of a variety of oxygenated functional groups, including hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (-C[dbnd]O), and ether (-C-O) moieties, within the microplastic substrate. The analysis of succession in the community structure of sediment bacteria during the degradation phase disclosed that Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas emerged as the principal bacterial players in PE degradation. These taxa were directly implicated in oxidative metabolic pathways facilitated by diverse oxidase enzymes under iron-facilitated conditions. The present study highlights bacterial community succession as a new pivotal factor influencing the complex biodegradation dynamics of polyethylene (PE) microplastics. This investigation also reveals, for the first time, a unique degradation pathway for PE microplastics orchestrated by the multifaceted marine sediment microbiota. These novel insights shed light on the unique functional capabilities and internal biochemical mechanisms employed by the marine sediment microbiota in effectively degrading polyethylene microplastics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Macroalgal blooms are increasing globally, with those linked to pelagic Sargassum affecting over 30 nations since 2011. As Sargassum mats traverse the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, they entrap and transport plastic to coastal areas, intensifying pollution in diverse ecosystems. This research assessed microplastics (MPs) within Sargassum fluitans III collected from the northern Mexican Caribbean coast (March 2021 to January 2022). The study employed a hydrogen peroxide protocol for macroalgae pretreatment to optimize MP extraction. All samples analyzed contained MPs at monthly mean concentrations that ranged from 3.5 to 15.3 MPs g−1 DW, with fibers constituting ≥90%. Fiber colors, mainly transparent, blue, and black, exhibited diverse sizes and wear stages. The study underscores the pervasive and consistent presence of MPs in pelagic Sargassum reaching the Mexican Caribbean. Considering the documented Sargassum influxes to this coast in recent years (2789–11,297 tons km−1 yr−1), potential annual MP influxes range from 0.1 × 109 to 17.3 × 109 km−1 yr−1. Efficiently removing beach-cast Sargassum and directing it to landfills could serve as a viable strategy for the simultaneous removal of attached MPs from the ocean and coastal waters, offering a promising mitigation strategy to combat plastic pollution in the examined marine environment. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Non-Technical Summary Plastic harms ecosystem health and human livelihood on land, in rivers, and in the sea. To prevent and reduce plastic pollution, we must know how plastics move through the environment. Extreme events, such as floods, bring large amounts of plastic into rivers around the world. This article summarizes how different flood types (excessive rainfall, high river flow, or floods from the sea) flush or deposit plastic pollution, and how this impacts the environment. Furthermore, this paper also discusses how improved resilience to floods is important to prevent and reduce plastic pollution. Technical Summary Plastic pollution is ubiquitous in the environment and threatens terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Reducing plastic pollution requires a thorough understanding of its sources, sinks, abundance, and impact. The transport and retention dynamics of plastics are however complex, and assumed to be driven by natural factors, anthropogenic factors, and plastic item characteristics. Current literature shows diverging correlations between river discharge, wind speed, rainfall, and plastic transport. However, floods have been consistently demonstrated to impact plastic transport and dispersal. This paper presents a synthesis of the impact of floods on plastic pollution in the environment. For each specific flood type (fluvial, pluvial, coastal, and flash floods), we identified the driving transport mechanisms from the available literature. This paper introduces the plastic-flood nexus concept, which is the negative feedback loop between floods (mobilizing plastics), and plastic pollution (increasing flood risk through blockages). Moreover, the impact of flood-driven plastic transport was assessed, and it was argued that increasing flood resilience also reduces the impact of floods on plastic pollution. This paper provides a perspective on the importance of floods on global plastic pollution. Increasing flood resilience and breaking the plastic-flood nexus are crucial steps toward reducing environmental plastic pollution.

       " Marine ecosystems pollution by microplastics (MPs) is a global problem of special concern. The present study examines the prevalence and distribution of MPs and cellulosic particles in sublittoral coastal sediments of the Canary Islands archipelago (Spain). At twenty-six different locations alongside seven islands, three samples were taken parallel to the shoreline between 1 and 10 m depth (n = 78). Sediment samples were primarily digested with a H2O2 solution followed by four flotations in a saturated NaCl solution. The mean concentration obtained was 3.9 ± 1.6 items/g of dry weight. A similar distribution pattern was observed across all islands concerning particles morphology, color, size and composition: mainly colorless/translucent and blue fibers (60.0%). Additionally, fragments were also found, and to a much lesser extent microbeads, films and tangled messes. MicroFourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy analysis of 12.5% of the fibers, showed that they were mainly cellulosic (54.5%) -either natural or semisynthetic- followed by polyester (22.7%) and acrylic (4.5%). The potential correlation between particle distribution in nearshore sediments and wave intensity was also explored. This work provides the first comprehensive report on the current MPs content of the seabed of the region. © 2023 The Authors,\n",
       " Approximately 80% of marine plastic waste originates from land-based sources and enters oceans through rivers. Hence, to create effective regulations, it is crucial to thoroughly examine the processes by which land-based plastic waste flows into marine environments. To this end, this review covers the complete journey of macro- and microplastics from their initial input into rivers to their ultimate release into oceans. Here, we also discuss the primary influencing factors and current popular research topics. Additionally, the principles, applicability, accuracy, uncertainty, and potential improvement of the standard methods used for flux estimation at each stage are outlined. Emission estimates of land-based macro- and microplastics are typically assessed using the emission factor approach, coefficient accounting approach, or material flow analysis. Accurately estimating mismanaged plastic waste is crucial for reducing uncertainty in the macroplastic emission inventory. In our review of the processes by which land-originating plastics enter rivers, we categorized them into two major types: point-source and diffuse-source pollution. Land surface hydrological models simulate transport from diffuse sources to rivers, necessitating further research. Riverine (micro)plastic flux to the ocean is often estimated using monitoring statistics and watershed hydrological models at the watershed scale; however, standardized monitoring methods have not yet been established. At the global scale, algorithms based on river datasets are often used, which require further improvements in river data selection and microplastic number-mass conversion factors. Furthermore, the article summarizes the accuracy and sources of uncertainty of various methods. Future research efforts should focus on quantifying and mitigating uncertainties in resultant projections. Overall, this review deepens our understanding of the processes by which land-based plastic waste enters the ocean and helps scholars efficiently select or improve relevant methods when studying land-ocean transport fluxes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The Yangtze River has always been considered an important river for transporting microplastics into the sea. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the degree of microplastic pollution in the sediment of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has affected the estimation of microplastic flux into the sea. In this study, microplastics in sediments from 55 stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were investigated, including 48 mainstream stations, 5 confluence stations, and 2 lake stations. Microplastics were detected in 34 stations, ranging from 0 to 71.04 n/kg of dry weight. The average concentrations of microplastics in the mainstream, confluence and lake were 6.16 ± 8.87, 23.91 ± 11.2, and 43.95 ± 27.09n/kg of dry weight, respectively. Of all the microplastics found in this investigation, fiber (59.52 %) forms the main type in terms of shape; PET is the most abundant microplastic species, accounting for 51.19 %. Sewage treatment plants are the most likely source of microplastics in sediment, and sediment from tributary estuaries, lake mouths, and lakes is an important sink of microplastics. Terrain, sediment transport load, biofilm, and flow velocity are important factors affecting microplastic settlement. Although there are multiple microplastic enrichment areas, the high flow velocity during the flood season makes it difficult for microplastics to remain in the sediment of the Yangtze River bed. This indicates that microplastics in riverbed sediments have little influence on the flux into the sea during flood season. This study is the first large-scale investigation of microplastics in riverbed sediments in the Yangtze river basin. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research,\n",
       " Stormwater represent a critical pathway for transporting microplastics (MPs) to surface waters. Due to complex dynamics of MPs in stormwater, its dispersion, weathering, risk, and transport are poorly understood. This review bridges those gaps by summarizing the latest findings on sources, abundance, characteristics, and dynamics involved in stormwater MP pollution. Weathering starts before or after MPs enter stormwater and is more pronounced on land due to continuous heat and mechanical stress. Land use patterns, rainfall intensity, MPs size and density, and drainage characteristics influence the transport of MPs in stormwater. Tire and road wear particles (TRWPs), littering, and road dust are major sources of MPs in stormwater. The concentrations of MPs varies from 0.38–197,000 particles/L globally. Further MP concentrations showed regional variations, highlighting the importance of local monitoring efforts needed to understand local pollution sources. We observed unique signatures associated with the shape and color of MPs. Fibers and fragments were widely reported, with transparent and black being the predominant colors. We conclude that the contribution of stormwater to MP pollution in surface waters is significantly greater than wastewater treatment plant effluents and demands immediate attention. Field and lab scale studies are needed to understand its behavior in stormwater and the risk posed to the downstream water bodies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) accumulation in sediments has posed a huge threat to freshwater ecosystems. However, it is still unclear the effect of MPs on riparian sediment structures and contaminant adsorption under different hydrological processes. In this study, three concentrations of polyamide (PA) MPs-treated sediments (0.1%, 1%, and 10%, w/w) were subjected to natural (NA) exposure, dry-wet (DW) cycles, and freeze-thaw (FT) cycles. The results indicated that PA MPs-added sediment increased the micro-aggregates by 10.1%−18.6% after FT cycles, leading to a decrease in aggregate stability. The pH, OM, and DOC of sediments were significantly increased in DW and FT treatments. In addition, the increasing concentration of PA MPs showed an obvious decrease in aromaticity, humification, and molecular weight of sediment DOM in FT treatments. Also, high level of MPs was more likely to inhibit the formation of humic-like substances and tryptophan-like proteins. For DW and FT cycles, 0.1% and 1% PA MPs-treated sediments slightly increased the adsorption capacity of Cd(II), which may be ascribed to the aging of MPs. Further correlation analysis found that DW and FT altered the link between DOM indicators, and aggregate stability was directly related to the changes in sediment organic carbon. Our findings revealed the ecological risk of MPs accumulating in riparian sediments under typical hydrological processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Suspended sediment (SS) is a natural component of aquatic environments. It is characterized by the adsorption of pollutants, and its physical properties can affect water volume quality. In this study, SS dynamics were simulated using a 2D hydrodynamic model in the Nanji Mountain Nature Reserve (NNR), and the fluxes of pollutants caused by SS were calculated to assess the biological risks during the wet (May–August) and dry (November–March) seasons. High spatial and temporal variability in SS load within the NNR was found in this study. The average SS load in the reserve increased and then decreased during the year, and the SS input from Ganjiang significantly affected the SS load in the NNR (p < 0.01). The SS load uptrend in the NNR occurred later than that of Ganjiang during the wet season because of the SS sedimentation in the NNR. And the suspension of SS in the NNR during the dry season resulted in a later SS load downtrend compared to Ganjiang. High SS load from Ganjiang during the wet season was responsible for the high nutrient and microplastic fluxes in the NNR, which were 8.38 and 10.61 times higher than those in the dry season, respectively. And the pollutant fluxes during the wet season were almost all from Ganjiang. In contrast, higher waterbird diversity and population during the dry season is the main reason for the increased biological risk of contaminants. Therefore, monitoring and managing SS and its contamination concentrations in rivers entering the lake is helpful for the protection of ecologically sensitive areas and key species in the lake. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) are becoming an increasingly severe global problem due to their widespread distribution and complex impact on living organisms. Apart from their environmental impact, the effects of MNPs on living organisms have also continued to attract attention. The harmful impact of MNPs has been extensively documented in marine invertebrates and larger marine vertebrates like fish. However, the research on the toxicity of these particles on mammals is still limited, and their possible effects on humans are poorly understood. Considering that MNPs are commonly found in food or food packaging, humans are primarily exposed to them through ingestion. It would be valuable to investigate the potential harmful effects of these particles on gut health. This review focuses on recent research exploring the toxicological impacts of micro- and nanoplastics on the gut, as observed in human cell lines and mammalian models. Available data from various studies indicate that the accumulation of MNPs in mammalian models and human cells may result in adverse consequences, in terms of epithelial toxicity, immune toxicity, and the disruption of the gut microbiota. The paper also discusses the current research limitations and prospects in this field, aiming to provide a scientific basis and reference for further studies on the toxic mechanisms of micro- and nanoplastics. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) converge multiple sourced microplastics (MPs) and serve as a temporary repository in the case of releasing them into the environment. The process involves two critical scientific problems, including the source composition of MPs and their fate in WWTPs. Therefore, this study conducted a full-scale investigation in each stage of four WWTPs in Hong Kong, with the results showing that the fate of MPs was mainly affected by their physicochemical characteristics and WWTP parameters. Moreover, three conventional machine learning (ML) methods, namely the multilabel decision tree, random forests, and support vector machine, were also applied for figuring out the source compositions of MPs. The results demonstrated that the sources of MPs were mainly composed of domestic (57.3-59.9%), industrial (21.1-21.7%), coastal (11.2-12.7%), domestic/medical (4.6-5.1%), and domestic/agricultural (2.6-3.8%) sources, respectively. The discovery of domestic/medical-sourced MPs should draw the public’s attention to the insufficient management of used face masks. This study was a novel attempt to utilize ML to explore the fate and sources of MPs in environmental compartments, which provided new insights into developing the MP source tracing approaches from the source management of plastic contaminants. © 2023 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Plastic waste released into the environments breaks down into microplastics due to weathering, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mechanical abrasion, and animal grazing. However, little is known about the plastic fragmentation mediated by microbial degradation. Marine plastic-degrading bacteria may have a double-edged effect in removing plastics. In this study, two ubiquitous marine bacteria, Alcanivorax xenomutans and Halomonas titanicae, were confirmed to degrade polystyrene (PS) and lead to microplastic and nanoplastic generation. Biodegradation occurred during bacterial growth with PS as the sole energy source, and the formation of carboxyl and carboxylic acid groups, decreased heat resistance, generation of PS metabolic intermediates in cultures, and plastic weight loss were observed. The generation of microplastics was dynamic alongside PS biodegradation. The size of the released microplastics gradually changed from microsized plastics on the first day (1344 nm and 1480 nm, respectively) to nanoplastics on the 30th day (614 nm and 496 nm, respectively) by the two tested strains. The peak release from PS films reached 6.29 × 106 particles/L and 7.64 × 106 particles/L from degradation by A. xenomutans (Day 10) and H. titanicae (Day 5), respectively. Quantification revealed that 1.3% and 1.9% of PS was retained in the form of micro- and nanoplastics, while 4.5% and 1.9% were mineralized by A. xenomutans and H. titanicae at the end of incubation, respectively. This highlights the negative effects of microbial degradation, which results in the continuous release of numerous microplastics, especially nanoplastics, as a notable secondary pollution into marine ecosystems. Their fates in the vast aquatic system and their impact on marine lives are noted for further study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Chemical degradation testing often involves monitoring the loss of a chemical or the evolution of a single diagnostic product through time. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to tracing complex degradation networks using mass-spectrometry-based methods and open cheminformatics tools. Ester- and ether-based thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU_Ester and TPU_Ether) microplastics (350 μm) and microplastics-derived dissolved organic carbon (MP-DOC) were photoweathered in a simulated marine environment and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We formula-annotated 1342 and 2344 unique features in the MP-DOC of TPU_Ester and TPU_Ether, respectively. From these, we extracted 199 and 568 plausible parent-transformation product pairs via matching of features (a) with complementary increasing and decreasing trends (Spearman’s correlation coefficient between normalized intensity and time), (b) spectral similarities of at least three accurate mass MS2 fragments, and (c) at least 3 ppm agreement between the theoretical and measured change in m/z between the parent-transformation product formula. Molecular network analysis revealed that both chain scission and cross-linking reactions occur dynamically rather than degradation proceeding in a monotonic progression to smaller or more oxygenated structures. Network nodes with the highest degree of centrality were tentatively identified using in silico fragmentation and can be prioritized for toxicity screening or other physicochemical properties of interest. This work has important implications for chemical transformation tracking in complex mixtures and may someday enable improved elucidation of environmental transformation rules (i.e., structure-reactivity relationships) and fate modeling. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Purpose: Current evidence indicates that humans and animals are at increased risk of multiple health challenges due to microplastic (MP) profusion. However, mitigation is constrained by inadequate scientific data, further aggravated by the lack of evidence in many African countries. This review therefore synthesized evidence on the current extent of MP pollution in Africa and the analytical techniques for reporting. Design/methodology/approach: A literature search was undertaken in research databases. Medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and keywords were used in the literature search. The authors found 38 studies from 10 countries that met the inclusion criteria. Findings: Marine organisms had MPs prevalence ranging from 19% to 100%, whereas sediments and water samples had between 77 and 100%. The most common and dominant polymers included polypropylene and polyethylene. Practical implications: This review shows that most studies still use methods that are prone to human errors. Therefore, the concentration of MPs is likely underestimated, even though the authors’ prevalence evaluations show MPs are still largely pervasive across multiple environmental matrices. Also, the study reveals significant spatial disparity in MP research across the African continent, showing the need for further research in other African countries. Originality/value: Even though some reviews have assessed MPs pollution in Africa, they have not evaluated sample prevalence, which is necessary to understand not only concentration but pervasiveness across the continent. Secondly, this study delves deeper into various methods of sampling, extraction and analysis of MPs, as well as limitations and relevant recommendations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.,\n",
       " Reservoirs are regarded as potential collection sites for microplastics (MPs), and ample water resources in plateau regions provide favorable natural conditions for hydroelectric power generation. However, research on the impact of cascade reservoir construction in the plateau region on the fate of MPs within the watershed is limited. In this study, the Yalong River, an alpine canyon river in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, was selected as the research area. This study explored the distribution of MPs at various depths in water, sediment, and riverbank soil as well as the formation of “MP communities” within the river-cascade reservoir system. Furthermore, the effects of dam construction on MPs' migration in different environments were analyzed. The results revealed that the abundance of MPs in the water and sediment within the cascade reservoir area (CRA) was significantly higher than that in the river area (RA) (P < 0.001). Additionally, the trend of increasing MPs in water with decreasing altitude was notably slower in CRA. Regarding shape, the proportion of fibers in the water within the CRA was significantly lower than that in the RA, with a smaller vertical migration rate in the water than in the sediment. The proportion of MPs < 500 μm in the water within the CRA was significantly higher than that in the RA. High-density MPs were notably deposited in the reservoir sediments. The analysis of the MP communities revealed that the construction of cascade dams led to relative geographical isolation between different sampling sites, reducing the similarity of MP communities in the CRA. This study established a theoretical foundation for understanding the impact of cascade dam construction on the fate characteristics of MPs and their potential risks in plateau areas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Although the laser-induced fluorescence method shows great potential for microplastic particle detection, overlapping fluorescence signals make accurate type and proportion identification difficult. This paper presents the identification of marine microplastics based on laser-induced fluorescence and principal component analysis. This method works by measuring the fluorescence spectra of water-containing microplastic samples irradiated with a 405-nm laser, which are then analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The nine types of microplastics were differentiated based on their positions in the PCA score plot. The mixed sample was positioned between the pure microplastic samples. The component ratio determines its position relative to that of the pure microplastic samples. The first two principal components of the mixed microplastics were linearly dependent. Natural seawater had less influence on the detection, and a mass concentration as low as 0.03% was detected. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marchica lagoon, a Ramsar site on Morocco's Mediterranean coast, has emerged as a prominent tourist destination within the Mediterranean region. However, the summer tourism is often accompanied by a rise in waste accumulation, especially on the surrounding beaches. The focus of this study is a detailed analysis of marine litter found on the beaches near Marchica Lagoon, specifically Al Mohandis, Bocana, and Nador Artificial Beach. The data collection for this study was carried out over a three-day period prior to the summer season in June 2023. The methodology adhered to the established protocols of the \"Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas.\" A total of 731 items of marine debris were collected from these three beaches, with an overall weight of 20395 kg. The composition of the collected debris revealed that polymer materials were the most prevalent, accounting for 81% of the total debris, followed by paper/cardboard (6.3%), metal (6.2%), processed wood (2.9%), glass/ceramics (1.9%), and cloth/textile (1.78%). The analysis indicates that the majority of the marine debris is associated with the activities of beach visitors. It is recommended that public awareness initiatives be implemented and solid waste management practices improved. © 2024 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.,\n",
       " The extensive usage of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) materials in marine environments raises concerns about their potential contribution to plastic pollution. Various factors contribute to the degradation of HDPE in marine environments, including UV radiation, seawater hydrolysis, biodegradation, and mechanical stress. Despite their supposed long lifespans, there is still a lack of understanding about the long-term degradation mechanisms that cause weathering of seawater-exposed HDPE products. In this research, the impact of UV radiation on the degradation of HDPE pile sleeves was studied in natural as well as laboratory settings to isolate the UV effect. After nine years of exposure to the marine environment in natural settings, the HDPE pile sleeves exhibited an increase in oxygen-containing surface functional groups and more morphological changes compared to accelerated UVB irradiation in the laboratory. This indicated that combined non-UV mechanisms may play a major role in HDPE degradation than UV irradiation alone. However, UVB irradiation was found to release dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen from HDPE pile sleeves, reaching levels of up to 15 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively. Our findings underscore the significance of taking into account both UV and non-UV degradation mechanisms when evaluating the role of HDPE in contributing to marine plastic pollution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The study addresses the growing concern of microplastic pollution in environmental matrices, emphasizing the significance of monitoring to understand their distribution, sources, and mitigation. Laboratory-based spectral reflectance analysis of water samples containing visible microplastics revealed distinctive spectral signatures. Coastal water samples collected over two campaigns were subjected to pretreatment to extract microplastics, and spectroscopic confirmation was followed by microscopic inspection. Results indicated average microplastics concentrations of 0.633 and 0.324 mg/L and 7.85 and 5.30 items/L in the datasets. Leveraging these findings, along with Sentinel-2 (Level-1C) data and spectral signatures, an empirical spectral microplastics model was developed to convert Sentinel-2's reflectance into microplastics concentrations. This model displayed an R2 of 87.30% and RMSE of ±0.015 mg/L. Subsequently, the model was employed to estimate microplastics concentrations in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, showcasing its potential for monitoring microplastic pollution in the study area and similar regions. © 2024, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

       " Tire particles (TPs), a significant group of microplastics, can be discharged into the coastal environments in various ways. However, our understanding of how TPs impact the antibiotic resistance and pathogenic risks of microorganisms in coastal sediments remains limited. In this study, we used metagenomics to investigate how TPs and their leachates could affect the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs), and their potential risks to the living creatures such as soil invertebrates and microorganisms in the coastal sediments. We discovered that TP addition significantly increased the abundance and diversity of ARGs and VFGs in coastal sediments, with raw TPs displayed higher impacts than TP leachates and TPs after leaching on ARGs and VFGs. With increasing TP exposure concentrations, the co-occurrence frequency of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the same contig also increased, suggesting that TPs could enhance the dispersal risk of ARGs. Our metagenome-based binning analysis further revealed that exposure to TPs increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB). In addition, chemical additives of TP leachates (e.g., Zn and N-cyclohexylformamide) significantly affected the changes of ARGs in the pore water. In summary, our study provides novel insights into the adverse effects of TP pollutions on aggravating the dissemination and pathogenic risks of ARGs and PARB in the coastal environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica is a growing concern, but many areas in this vast region remain unexplored. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of marine microplastic (MPs) concentrations in Potter Cove, located near the Argentinian Carlini research station on 25 de Mayo/King George Island, Antarctica. Water samples were collected at 14 sites within the cove, representing various influences from the station's activities. Two sampling methods were used: a 5 L Niskin bottle and an in-situ filtering device called Microfilter, allowing for large water volumes to be filtered. MPs were found in 100 % of the samples. Microfilter samples ranged from 0.02 to 2.14 MPs/L, with a mean concentration of 0.44 ± 0.44 MPs/L. Niskin bottle samples showed concentrations from 0.40 to 55.67 MPs/L, with a mean concentration of 19.03 ± 18.21 MPs/L. The dominant types of MPs were anthropogenic black, transparent, and pink microfibers (MFs) measuring between 0.11 and 3.6 mm (Microfilter) and 0.06 to 7.96 mm (Niskin bottle), with a median length of 0.01 mm for both methods. Transparent and black irregular microfragments (MFRs) with diameters from 0.10 to 5.08 mm and a median diameter of 0.49 mm were also prevalent. FTIR-spectroscopy revealed the presence of 14 types of polymers. Cellulose-based materials and polyethylene terephthalate were the most abundant in MFs, while polyurethanes and styrene-based copolymers dominated in MFRs. MPs were more abundant near the Carlini station. Compared to other coastal Antarctic areas, the MPs in the cove were relatively abundant and mostly smaller than 1 mm. Local activities on the island were identified as the primary source of MPs in the cove, and the cyclonic water circulation likely affects the distribution of small-sized particles. To protect the ecosystem, reducing plastic usage, improving waste management, regulating MPs debris, and enhancing wastewater practices are essential. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastic additives are widely used in plastic production and are found in the environment owing to their widespread applications. Among these additives, N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (NBBS) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) are under international watchlist for evaluation, with limited studies on amphipods. Di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are banned in some countries and categorised as substances of very high concern. This study aimed to investigate the effects of NBBS, TPHP, DEHP and DBP on the swimming activity of a coastal intertidal marine amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus. Furthermore, this study is the first to quantify startle response in E. marinus in response to light stimuli. Amphipods were exposed to 0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 μg/l concentrations of all test compounds. Swimming activity and startle responses were assessed by video tracking and analysis using an 8-min alternating dark and light protocol after exposure on days 7 and 14. We observed an overall compound and light effect on the swimming activity of E. marinus. A significant decrease in swimming distance was found in 500 μg/l NBBS and TPHP. We observed that the startle response in E. marinus had a latency period of >2 s and animals were assessed at 1 s and the sum of the first 5 s. There was a clear startle response in E. marinus during dark to light transition, evident with increased swimming distance. NBBS exposure significantly increased startle response at environmental concentrations, while significant effects were only seen in 500 μg/l TPHP at 5 s. We found no significant effects of DEHP and DBP on swimming behaviour at the concentrations assessed. The findings of this study affirm the necessity for a continuous review of plastic additives to combat adverse behavioural effects that may be transferable to the population levels. © 2024,\n",
       " An experimental study was conducted on how polymer density affects the transport and fate of microplastics in aquatic flows. For the first time, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were chemically stained and tested using solute transport techniques and velocities found among rivers in the natural environment (0.016 – 0.361 m/s). The movement of 3D-polymers with densities ranging from 0.9 – 1.4 g/cm³ was quantified in a laboratory flume scaled to simulate open-channel flows in fluvial systems. Except for PP, in most conditions microplastics exhibited similar transport characteristics to solutes regardless of density and established solute transport models were successfully implemented to predict their transport and fate. Mass recoveries and ADE routing model demonstrated microplastic deposition and resuspension was associated with polymer density below critical velocity thresholds ≤ 0.1 m/s. When density becomes the dominant force at these slower velocities, concentrations of denser than water microplastics will be momentarily or permanently deposited in channel beds and microplastics follow the classical Shields sediment transport methodology. This data is the first to provide microplastic suspension and deposition thresholds based on river velocity and polymer density, making a key contribution to research predicting microplastic fate and organismal exposure. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The root cause of global pollution is the reflection of usage of non-degradable plastics. The solutions and methods to mitigate the plastic pollution are in high demand. The application of green technology in polymer science from the marine resource gives stability to the ecosystem. The bio-composite films were fabricated using gelatin of fish scale, agar of seaweed and chitosan of shrimp shell waste by a solvent casting technique. The plasticity and bioactivity enhanced using glycerol and clove essential oil. The physic-chemical and mechanical properties of the film were evaluated against the range of test of thickness, tensile strength, elongation at break, puncture resistance, water vapor permeability, Attenuated Total Reflection—Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The characteristics of active packaging mechanism assessed based on antimicrobial and antioxidative properties. A level of 1.5% clove essential oil ration was given desirable properties of active packaging material. The biodegradability was calculated in terms of percentage weight loss under the soil burial and water immersion test. The biodegradation process of composite film took 21 days in soil and 158 in water. Hence, the bio-composite film prepared from green technology is a promising alternative to the conventional plastic to mitigate plastic pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution has garnered global attention in recent years. Although anthropogenic factors have been extensively studied for their impacts on MP pollution, there is still a lack of research on the relationship between non-anthropogenic factors and MP occurrence in inland freshwater. This study investigated MP pollution in Donghu Lake, the largest urban freshwater lake in China, to examine the effects of rainfall and lakeshore soil properties on MP pollution. The MP abundance in the surface water of Donghu Lake was 5.84 ± 2.95 items per L under the equilibrium state. However, during and after rainfall, the MP abundances significantly increased to 8.27 ± 5.65 items per L and 7.60 ± 4.04 items per L, respectively (p < 0.05). This increase could be attributed to an increase in the amount of MPs transported to the lake via atmospheric deposition and rainfall runoff, as well as the re-suspension of MP debris in sediment during stronger hydrodynamics. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between MP abundance and lakeshore soil particle size. It suggested that a high proportion of large-sized soil particles created large pores that enabled MPs to be deposited in the surface layer of soil to migrate to deeper layers. As a result, the amount of MPs in the surface soil and transported to the lake via surface runoff was low. It is of practical significance to understand the sources and distribution impact factors of MPs in urban lakes. The fate and effects of MPs retained in the inland freshwater environments should receive more attention. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.,\n",
       " Mangrove ecosystems are major carbon sink biomes and also a sink of microplastics (MPs). The final enrichment of MPs in sediments may have a significant impact on the microbial community and carbon turnover in the soil. However, the effects of MP pollution on the mangrove soil microbial communities and carbon release remain unknown. Here, we conducted a manipulative incubation experiment by adding MPs to soil at different soil depths to examine the effect of enriched MPs on soil microorganisms and its function (i.e., decomposition of soil carbon). The results showed that the addition of MPs had no significant effect on the microbial diversity and CO2 cumulative emission in the topsoil but significantly increased CO2 release from the subsoil. The promoting effect of polylactide (PLA) on the release of CO2 from the subsoil was stronger than that of polyethylene (PE) and aging PE. In the subsoil, the activity of soil extracellular enzymes related to N acquisition increased with the MP addition, indicating an increase in microbial N deficiency. The subsoil was more sensitive to MPs because of the exacerbated nitrogen limitation. MP addition reduced the microbial diversity of the subsoil and altered soil microbial interactions. The increasing abundance of some microbial taxa, especially bacteria related to the sulfur cycle, indicated more active electron transfer and organic carbon mineralization in the subsoil. Our findings suggest that MP contamination has potential effects on microbial communities, nutrient cycling, and carbon release in mangrove soils that vary depending on soil depth. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Rising ocean temperatures are driving unprecedented changes in global marine ecosystems. Meanwhile, there is growing concern about microplastic and nanoplastic (MNP) contamination, which can endanger marine organisms. Increasing ocean warming (OW) and plastic pollution inevitably cause marine organisms to interact with MNPs, but relevant studies remain sparse. Here, we investigated the interplay between ocean warming and MNP in the marine water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis. We found that combined exposure to MNPs and OW induced reproductive failure in the F2 generation. In particular, the combined effects of OW and MNPs on the F2 generation were associated with key genes related to reproduction and stress response. Moreover, populations of predatory bacteria were significantly larger under OW and MNP conditions during F2 generations, suggesting a potential link between altered microbiota and host fitness. These results were supported by a host transcriptome and microbiota interaction analysis. This research sheds light on the complex interplay between environmental stressors, their multigenerational effects on marine organisms, and the function of the microbiome. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The Yangtze River is an important global channel for plastics and microplastics (MPs) to enter the sea. However, the existing research on MPs in the Yangtze River has primarily focused on the mainstream region, without regarding the occurrence, spatial distribution, and ecological risks associated with tributaries, as well as their relationship with the mainstream. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a large-scale catchment-wide investigation of the surface water in the Yangtze River, encompassing MPs (48 µm–5 mm) of the mainstream and 15 important tributaries. Tributaries and upstream regions exhibited relatively higher levels of MPs compared with the mainstream and different sections of the river. The distribution of MPs is primarily influenced by the emission of arable land and the pH of water. Notably, the upstream tributary areas demonstrated the highest ecological risks associated with MPs. Further analysis highlighted that the tributaries accounted for a contribution ranging from 16% to 67% in quantity and from 14% to 90% in mass of the microplastics observed in the mainstream. Our results suggest that the pollution of tributaries and their associated ecological risk migration must be effectively regulated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Sixteen surface (5) and groundwater (11) samples were collected from the south-eastern part of Attica, Greece, and analysed for physico-chemical parameters and microplastics (MPs) by optical microscopy and Raman microspectroscopy (RS). A total of 3399 particles were optically identified in all sixteen samples, ranging from only 16 particles/L in a sample from a deeper borehole to 513 particles/L in a sample from a shallow water well. They were then visually classified into eight categories based on their color, texture, size, reflectivity, shape, and general morphological properties. Raman microspectroscopy was performed on the particles on the filters and revealed four different types of MPs, namely polyethylene (PE, 35%), polypropylene (PP, 30%), polystyrene (PS, 10%), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 25%). The samples from the shallow phreatic aquifer contained more MPs than the samples from the deeper borehole, which contained fewer MPs and categories. This is to be expected, since the phreatic aquifer (a) is generally more contaminated, as it is close to human activities that generate MPs and its infiltration depth is only a few metres, which means that many microplastics can infiltrate at such shallow depths, and (b) it is exposed to the atmosphere, so they can also be suspended in the air. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that MPs, especially PET and PE, were detected in the borehole sample, suggesting that MPs can migrate to greater depths through water infiltration. Chemical analyses of the groundwater samples revealed high values of E.C., Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, and Na+, which indicate that seawater intrusion is taking place in the coastal aquifer system of the Erasinos basin. The increased concentrations of NO3− and PO43− also indicate the impact of agricultural activities. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a global occurrence from villages to urban, farms to deserts, deep oceans to mountaintops, tropical landfills to arctic snow including in food chain. Over the past 60 years, there has been a steady build-up of plastic garbage on land and ocean's surface, mainly because of the unplanned, unrestricted use of plastic in routine use, non-cycling and use and throw habit of a common man. As usage of this strong and cheap material has increased over the past few decades, the waste problem has gotten worse because of non-biodegradation in nature. Since the turn of the century, the amount of plastic produced worldwide has quadrupled, reaching over 400 million metric tonnes annually in 2021. While plastic items typically have a lifespan of ten years, depending on their composition and method of disposal, plastics can take up to 500 years to degrade. The environment is harmed by the removal of all this plastic. Only 16% of plastics are recycled; the remainder is either disposed of in landfills or burned. © 2024, IGI Global.

       " Microplastics are fragments of plastic less than 5 mm in size, produced either by the breakdown of plastic waste or by using tiny pieces of plastic. The study aimed to classify the different kinds of microplastics found in the Martapura River's water, sediment, and fish. Sedgewick rafter and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used for this study. This study's findings suggest a dissimilar distribution of microplastics between the two villages of Loktangga and Teluk Muara Kelayan. Nylon was found to be the most common type of microplastic in Lok Tangga Village. Meanwhile, polystyrene and polycarbonate were found to be the most common types of microplastics in Teluk Muara Kelayan. The dispersed nature of the microplastic pollution point to distinct regional origins or unique transport and deposition mechanisms. Knowing the specific types of microplastics found in a given area helps determine where they came from and develop effective solutions. More studies may be needed to pinpoint the precise causes and assess their effects on aquatic life and human health. © 2024 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.,\n",
       " Microplastics are tiny plastic particles smaller than 5 mm. that have been widely detected in the environment, including in wastewater. They originate from various sources including breakdown of larger plastic debris, release of plastic fibres from textiles, and microbeads commonly used in personal care products. In wastewater, microplastics can pass through the treatment process and enter the environment, causing harm to biodiversity by potentially entering the food chain. Additionally, microplastics can act as a vector for harmful pollutants, increasing their transport and distribution in the environment. To address this issue, there is a growing need for effective wastewater treatment methods that can effectively remove microplastics. Currently, several physical and chemical methods are available, including filtration, sedimentation, and chemical degradation. However, these methods are costly, low efficiency and generate secondary pollutants. Furthermore, lack of standardization in the measurement and reporting of microplastics in wastewater, makes it difficult to accurately assess microplastic impact on the environment. In order to effectively manage these issues, further research and development of effective and efficient methods for removing microplastics from wastewater, as well as standardization in measurement and reporting, are necessary to effectively manage these detrimental contaminants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The abundance of microplastics (MPs) in the gastrointestinal tract (GT), gills (GI), and exoskeleton (EX) of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp cultured in a commercial indoor super-intensive controlled (ISCO) system was investigated. Shrimp of 25 days (postlarvae; PL25), and one, three, five, and seven culture months were analyzed. The postlarvae PL25 MP abundance per individual and gram of PL (wet weight) was 0.2 ± 0.0 MPs and 3.5 ± 0.5 MPs/g. For L. vannamei juveniles at one, three, five, and seven culture months, the MP abundance per juvenile shrimp was 10.0 ± 0.3, 27.2 ± 1.6, 32.3 ± 3.1, and 40.3 ± 3.6 MPs/individual, respectively (expressed in MPs/g of tissue were 1.6 ± 0.1, 2.0 ± 0.2, 2.0 ± 0.3 and 1.5 ± 0.2, respectively). Fibers were the most common MP type in all shrimp age classes (42.1–68.7 %), and the predominant color was transparent (46.1–65.0 %). The MP size in all shrimp stages ranged between 15 and 4686 μm. In general, the predominant polymers identified were PE (37.4 %), NY (21.1 %), and PET (18.5 %). The MP variability through the culture cycle showed that as the age of shrimp increased, and the culture advanced the MP abundance and size also augmented. Conversely, there is a higher MP abundance in L. vannamei cultured in ISCO systems compared to shrimp cultured in traditional semi-intensive and intensive ponds and those from wild environments. The latter is probably due to the extensive use of plasticized materials (geomembrane and greenhouse installations) and their degradation, which cause a greater MP exposure to shrimp. The estimated oral MP intake by ISCO shrimp consumption was 647 MPs/capita/year, which can be 178 % more than from wild shrimp. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Clay materials were prepared with clay and sapropel (SP) or clay and modified (frozen) sapropel (FSP) as the main raw materials. Clay-based materials were formed by mixing clay with a different dosage of SP or FSP (5–30 wt.%). The effect of SP or FSP on the properties and biological resistance of clay-based materials was studied. The results show that the bulk density of clay-based materials decreased, and the compressive strength and initial rate of water absorption increased with the increase in the SP or FSP amount in the clay mixture. Research has shown that SP or FSP can be added as a natural additive containing microfibers to improve the mechanical properties of clay materials. When clay bricks had less than 15% sapropel, dry or frozen, we tested the resistance impact of the fungi Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Stachybotrys chartarum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, and Aureobasidium pullulans under normal conditions. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Both micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) possessed excellent properties and diverse applications, albeit gained worldwide attention due to their anthropogenic, ubiquitous, degradation resistant nature and a wide variety of ecological and human health impacts. MNPs and PFAS discharged from discrete sources and extensively bioaccumulated in the food chain through trophic transfer and their long-distance transport potential assist in their dispersal to pristine but vulnerable ecosystems such as Antarctica. They inevitably interacted with each other in the environment through polarized N-H bond, hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, and weak bond energies such as Van der Waals, electrostatic, and intramolecular forces. During co-exposure, they significantly impact the uptake and bioaccumulation of each other in exposed organisms, which may increase or decrease their bioavailable concentration. Hence, this review compiles the studies on the co-occurrence and adsorption of PFAS and MNPs in the environment, their trophic transfer, combined in vivo and in vitro impacts, and factors influencing the MNP-PFAS interface. A significant proportion of studies were conducted in China, Europe, and the US, while studies are rare from other parts of the world. Freshwater and marine food chains were more prominently investigated for trophic transfers compared to terrestrial food chains. The most notable in vivo effects were growth and reproductive impairment, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and apoptosis, DNA damage, genotoxicity and immunological responses, behavioral and gut microbiota modifications, and histopathological alterations. Cellular uptake of PFAS and MNPs can impact cell survival and proliferation, photosynthesis and membrane integrity, ROS generation and antioxidant responses, and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) release in vitro. MNP characteristics, PFAS properties, tissue and species-dependent distribution, and environmental medium properties were the main factors influencing the PFAS and MNP nexus and associated impacts. Last but not least, gaps and future research directions were highlighted to better understand the interplay between these critical persistent chemicals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The global ocean has been receiving massive amounts of plastic wastes. Marine biodegradation, influenced by global climate, naturally breaks down these wastes. In this study, we systematically compared the biodegradation performance of petroleum- and bio-based plastic films, i.e., low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) under three ambient temperatures (4, 15, and 22 °C). We deployed the our previously isolated cold-tolerant plastic-degrading Alcanivorax to simulate the accelerated marine biodegradation process and evaluated the alteration of bacterial growth, plastic films, and released degradation products. Notably, we found that marine biodegradation of PHA films enriched more bacterial amounts, induced more conspicuous morphological damage, and released more microplastics (MPs) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) under all temperatures compared to LDPE and PLA. Particularly, MPs were released from film edges and cracks with a mean size of 2.8 μm under all temperatures. In addition, the degradation products released by biodegradation of PHA under 22 °C induced the highest acute toxicity to Vibrio fischeri. Our results highlighted that: (1) marine biodegradation of plastics would release millions of MPs per cm2 exposed surface area even in cold environments within 60 days; (2) different marine biodegradation scenarios of these plastics may raise disparate impacts and mitigation-related studies. © 2024,\n",
       " The continuous production and widespread use of synthetic plastics, along with the resulting waste, pose significant environmental challenges and threaten ecosystems. Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a novel type of contaminants in aquatic environments, posing risks to both ecosystems and human health. Egypt is distinguished by the diversity of its aquatic environment. The Mediterranean Sea is globally recognized as a major hotspot for the accumulation of marine litter and plastic pollution. On the other hand, the Nile River is considered a major source of plastic pollution flowing into the eastern Mediterranean basin. In addition, the Red Sea Coast of Egypt is confronted with various anthropogenic stressors that contribute to the accumulation of plastic litter in the region, causing a significant threat to the sensitive and critical ecosystems found there. Despite the global documentation of MPs pollution, there is a lack of sufficient data on the extent of MPs and their interaction with other contaminants in the aquatic environment of Egypt. Monitoring and assessing the extent of MPs pollution in aquatic environments are crucial initial steps, providing a foundation for developing recommendations and policies to mitigate major marine pollutants. This study concerned with MPs pollution in the aquatic environment, with an aim to define the various types of MPs, their sources, fate, toxicity, characterization and impact on human health. In addition, it aimed to summarize the existing research conducted in the Egyptian aquatic environments, offering an overview of the current knowledge regarding the abundance and distribution of MPs in Egypt's aquatic ecosystems. © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

       " Marine litter is a growing environmental problem for which fisheries-sourced waste remains poorly understood. In Peru, there is an ongoing challenge of waste management from the small-scale fisheries fleet given the lack of facilities to receive the variety of debris produced by fishers, which includes hazardous wastes such as batteries. In this study, onboard solid waste production was monitored daily by land-based observers upon landing at the port of Salaverry, Peru, from March to September 2017. The analysed small-scale gillnet and longline fishing fleets produced annually an estimated 11,260 kg of solid waste. Of particular concern is the production of single use plastics (3427 kg) and batteries (861 kg) due to their potential long-lasting impacts on the environment and challenges related to their proper disposal. A management plan for solid waste has been developed for Salaverry; therefore, a subsequent assessment was conducted in 2021–2022 of the behaviours and perceptions of fishers regarding the implementation of this plan. Most fishers (96%) reported disposing of their waste on land, except organic waste which is disposed of at sea. While fishers in Salaverry have become more conscious of the issues surrounding at-sea waste disposal and have an interest in better segregating and managing their waste, there remains a need for improved waste management and recycling protocols and procedures at the port to make this possible. © The Author(s) 2023.,\n",
       " The pollution of the marine environment with plastic debris is expected to increase, where ocean currents and winds cause their accumulation in convergence zones like the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). Surface-floating plastic (>330 μm) was collected in the North Pacific Ocean between Vancouver (Canada) and Singapore using a neuston catamaran and identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Baseline concentrations of 41,600-102,700 items km-2 were found, dominated by polyethylene and polypropylene. Higher concentrations (factors 4-10) of plastic items occurred not only in the NPSG (452,800 items km-2) but also in a second area, the Papaha̅naumokua̅kea Marine National Monument (PMNM, 285,200 items km-2). This second maximum was neither reported previously nor predicted by the applied ocean current model. Visual observations of floating debris (>5 cm; 8-2565 items km-2 and 34-4941 items km-2 including smaller “white bits”) yielded similar patterns of baseline pollution (34-3265 items km-2) and elevated concentrations of plastic debris in the NPSG (67-4941 items km-2) and the PMNM (295-3748 items km-2). These findings suggest that ocean currents are not the only factor provoking plastic debris accumulation in the ocean. Visual observations may be useful to increase our knowledge of large-scale (micro)plastic pollution in the global oceans. © 2024 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society,\n",
       " Turbidity can be a result of suspended natural particles, such as sediment, or anthropogenic particles such as microplastics. This study assessed whether Daphnia magna, a pelagic filter feeder known to ingest suspended particles, have an altered response to equally turbid environments caused by the presence of either suspended bentonite or suspended polyethylene microplastics. Compared to controls, daphnids exposed to suspended bentonite maintained their feeding efficiency and increased their digestive activity, as measured by mandibular movement, peristalsis, and expulsion, to pass bentonite through the digestive tract. The same effects were not seen in microplastic-exposed individuals, in which feeding efficiency was decreased and only peristaltic movement was increased but without a coordinated increase in expulsion, suggesting that microplastics do not have the same ability as bentonite to pass through the digestive tract. This study highlights the need to discern the identities of particulates contributing to turbid environments as different particles, even of the same size, can have different effects on filter feeders, which inherently ingest suspended particles. © 2023 The Authors.

       " River systems are important recipients of environmental plastic pollution and have become key pathways for the transfer of mismanaged waste from the land to the ocean. Understanding the sources and fate of plastic debris, including plastic litter (>5 mm) and microplastics (MPs) (<5 mm), entering different riverine systems is essential to mitigate the ongoing environmental plastic pollution crisis. We comprehensively investigated the plastic pollution in the catchments of two rivers in the Yangtze River basin: an urban river, the Suzhou section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (SZ); and a pristine rural river, the Jingmen section of the Hanjiang River (JM). The abundance of plastic pollutants in SZ was significantly higher than in JM: 0.430 ± 0.450 items/m3 and 0.003 ± 0.003 items/m3 of plastic litter in the water; 23.47 ± 25.53 n/m3 and 2.78 ± 1.55 n/m3 MPs in the water; and 218.82 ± 77.40 items/kg and 5.30 ± 1.99 items/kg of MPs in the sediment, respectively. Plastic litter and MPs were closely correlated in abundance and polymer composition. Overall, the polymer type, shape and color of MPs were dominant by polypropylene (42.5%), fragment (60.4%) and transparent (40.0%), respectively. Source tracing analysis revealed that packaging, shipping, and wastewater were the primary sources of plastic pollutants. The mantel analysis indicated that socio-economic and geospatial factors play crucial roles in driving the hotspot formation of plastic pollution in river networks. The composition of the MP communities differed significantly between the sediments and the overlying water. The urban riverbed sediments had a more pronounced pollutant ‘sink’ effect compared with the pristine rivers. These findings suggested that the modification of natural streams during urbanization may influence the transport and fate of plastic pollutants in them. Our results offer pivotal insights into effective preventive measures. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.,\n",
       " The stomach content of 60 krill specimens from the Southern Ocean were analyzed for the presence of microplastic (MP), by testing different sample volumes, extraction approaches, and applying hyperspectral imaging Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μFTIR). Strict quality control was applied on the generated results. A high load of residual materials in pooled samples hampered the analysis and avoided a reliable determination of putative MP particles. Individual krill stomachs displayed reliable results, however, only after re-treating the samples with hydrogen peroxide. Before this treatment, lipid rich residues of krill resulted in false assignments of polymer categories and hence, false high MP particle numbers. Finally, MP was identified in 4 stomachs out of 60, with only one MP particle per stomach. Our study highlights the importance of strict quality control to verify results before coming to a final decision on MP contamination in the environment to aid the establishment of suitable internationally standardized protocols for sampling and analysis of MP in organisms including their habitats in Southern Ocean and worldwide. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The transport of microplastics (MPs) is susceptible to being influenced by catchment hydrology; however, there is a notable lack of research on their retention and responses to flood events in estuarine sedimentary records. Herein, we collected two cores in the Yangtze Estuary to explore their microplastic pollution, influencing factors and linkage to flood events. MP abundance exhibited a decreasing trend from the top to the bottom in both cores. Both plastic production and sediment mean grain size showed a significant positive correlation with MP abundance. The sedimentary record displayed a marked surge in MP abundance during the extreme flood period, suggesting a direct influence of flooding on MP deposition. The resuspension of upstream MPs and erosion of land-based MPs by heavy rain might be responsible for this increase. Furthermore, our study identified significant periodicities in MP abundance, closely aligned with the hydrological patterns of the Yangtze River. This study highlights the role of floods in fluvial MP distribution and proposes MPs as a proxy of extreme floods from the 20th century in estuarine environments. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic waste has become a major global issue, with over 390.7 million tons of plastic produced in 2021. Because of its durability, low recycling rates, poor waste management, and maritime use, a considerable portion of plastic waste ends up in aquatic environments. Photo-oxidation and other mechanisms degrade plastics into microplastics (MPs), which are particles smaller than 5 mm. MPs can spread through the aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic areas, and running waterways serve as conduits for MP transport across various ecosystems. MPs have been found at various levels of the food web, and animals can ingest, inhale, or absorb them through their skin. MPs pose a significant health risk to flora and fauna, including marine creatures and humans, due to their small size, diverse colors, high abundance, and ability to adsorb antibiotic-resistant pathogens, causing cytotoxicity, acute reactions, undesirable immunological responses, neurotoxicity, and DNA alteration. MPs have a negative economic impact on industries such as agriculture, fishing, tourism, etc. Detecting and quantifying the presence of MPs is therefore critical. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the various techniques and equipment used to detect and characterize MPs in aqueous environments. Identifying and educating the public about the primary sources of plastic pollution can help reduce the number of MPs in the environment. © 2024, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

       " Micro- (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are currently ubiquitous in the ecosystems, and freshwater biota is still insufficiently studied to understand the global fate, transport paths, and consequences of their presence. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of bivalves and a trophic transfer of MPs and NPs in an experimental food chain. The food chain consisted of terrestrial non-selective detritivore Dendrobaena (Eisenia) sp., freshwater benthic filter feeder Unio tumidus, and freshwater benthic detritivore-collectors Asellus aquaticus or Gammarus sp. Animals were exposed to different fluorescently labeled micro- and nanoplastics (PMMA 20 μm, nanoPS 15–18 nm, and 100 nm, PS 1 μm and 20 μm, PE from cosmetics) as well as to the faeces of animals exposed to plastics to assess their influence on the environmental transportation, availability to biota, and bioaccumulation of supplied particles. Damaged and intact fluorescent particles were observed in the faeces of terrestrial detritivores and in the droppings of aquatic filter feeders, respectively. They were also present in the guts of bivalves and of crustaceans which were fed with bivalve droppings. Bivalves (Unio tumidus, and additionally Unio pictorum, and Sphaerium corneum) produced droppings containing micro- and nanoparticles filtered from suspension and deposited them onto the tank bottom, making them available for broader feeding guilds of animals (e.g. collectors, like crustaceans). Finally, the natural ageing of PS and its morphological changes, leakage of the fluorescent labelling, and agglomeration of particles were demonstrated. That supports our hypothesis of the crucial role of the characterization of physical and chemical materials in adequately understanding the mechanisms of their interaction with biota. Microscopical methods (confocal, fluorescent, scanning electron) and Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy were used to track the particles' passage in a food web and monitor structural changes of the MPs' and NPs' surface. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The fragmentation of plastic debris is a key pathway to the formation of microplastic pollution. These disintegration processes depend on the materials' physical and chemical characteristics, but insight into these interrelationships is still limited, especially under natural conditions. Five plastics of known polymer/additive compositions and processing histories were deployed in aquatic environments and recovered after six and twelve months. The polymer types used were linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), oxo-degradable LLDPE (oxoLLDPE), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyamide-6 (PA6), and poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Four geographically distinct locations across Aotearoa/New Zealand were chosen: three marine sites and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Accelerated UV-weathering under controlled laboratory conditions was also carried out to evaluate artificial ageing as a model for plastic degradation in the natural environment. The samples' physical characteristics and surface microstructures were studied for each deployment location and exposure time. The strongest effects were found for oxoLLDPE upon artificial ageing, with increased crystallinity, intense surface cracking, and substantial deterioration of its mechanical properties. However, no changes to the same extent were found after recovery of the deployed material. In the deployment environments, the chemical nature of the plastics was the most relevant factor determining their behaviours. Few significant differences between the four aquatic locations were identified, except for PA6, where indications for biological surface degradation were found only in seawater, not the WWTP. In some cases, artificial ageing reasonably mimicked the changes which some plastic properties underwent in aquatic environments, but generally, it was no reliable model for natural degradation processes. The findings from this study have implications for the understanding of the initial phases of plastic degradation in aquatic environments, eventually leading to microplastics formation. They can also guide the interpretation of accelerated laboratory ageing for the fate of aquatic plastic pollution, and for the testing of aged plastic samples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The escalating utilization of plastics in daily life has resulted in pervasive environmental pollution and consequent health hazards. The challenge of detecting and capturing microplastics, which are imperceptible to the naked eye, is exacerbated by their diminutive size, hydrophobic surface properties, and capacity to absorb organic compounds. This study focuses on the application of peptides, constituted of specific amino acid sequences, and microneedles for the rapid and selective identification of microplastics. Peptides, due to their smaller size and greater environmental stability compared with antibodies, emerge as a potent solution to overcome the limitations inherent in existing detection methodologies. To immobilize peptides onto microneedles, this study employed microneedles embedded with gold nanorods, augmenting them with sulfhydryl (SH) groups at the peptides’ termini. The sensor developed through this methodology exhibited efficient peptide binding to the microneedle tips, thereby facilitating the capture of microplastics. Raman spectroscopy was employed for the detection of microplastics, with the results demonstrating successful attachment to the microneedles. This novel approach not only facilitates localized analysis but also presents a viable strategy for the detection of microplastics across diverse environmental settings. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " This study established a unique approach to assess fecal contamination by measuring fecal sterols, especially coprostanol (5β-cholestanol-3β-ol, 5β) and cholestanol (5α-cholestan-3β-ol, 5α) and their ratio 5β/(5β + 5α) alongside triclosan (TCS) and methyl-triclosan (MTC) in beached plastic pellets across 40 countries. Coprostanol concentrations ranged from 3.6 to 8190 ng/g pellet with extremely high levels in densely populated areas in African countries. The 5β/(5β + 5α) ratio was not affected by the difference in residence time of pellets in aquatic environments, and their spatial pattern showed a positive correlation with that of sedimentary sterols, demonstrating its reliability as an indicator of fecal contamination. Pellets from populated areas of economically developing countries, i.e., Africa and Asia, with lower coverage of wastewater treatment exhibited higher 5β/(5β + 5α) ratios (∼0.7) corresponding to ∼1% sewage in seawater, while pellets from developed countries, i.e., the USA, Canada, Japan, and Europe, with higher coverage of modern wastewater treatment displayed lower ratios (∼0.5), corresponding to the first contact limit. Triclosan levels were higher in developing countries (0.4-1298 ng/g pellet), whereas developed countries showed higher methyl-triclosan levels (0.5-70 ng/g pellet) due to TCS conversion during secondary treatment. However, some samples from Japan and Europe displayed higher TCS levels, suggesting contributions from combined sewage overflow (CSO). Combination of 5β/(5β + 5α) and MTC/TCS ratios revealed extreme fecal contamination from direct input of raw sewage due to inadequate treatment facilities in some African and South and Southeast Asian countries. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) could provide vector for microorganisms to form biofilm (plastisphere), but the shaping process of MPs biofilm and its effects on the structure and function of sedimentary microbial communities especially in aquaculture environments are not reported. For this, we incubated MPs biofilm in situ in an aquaculture pond and established a sediment microcosm with plastisphere. We found that the formation of MPs biofilm in surface water was basically stable after 30 d incubation, but the biofilm communities were reshaped after deposition for another 30 d, because they were more similar to plastisphere communities incubated directly within sediment but not surface water. Moreover, microbial communities of MPs-contaminated sediment were altered, which was mainly driven by the biofilm communities present on MPs, because they but not sediment communities in proximity to MPs had a more pronounced separation from the control sediment communities. In the presence of MPs, increased sediment nitrification, denitrification and N2O production rates were observed. The K00371 (NO2-⇋NO3-) pathway and elevated abundance of nxrB and narH genes were screened by metagenomic analysis. Based on structural equation model, two key bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria bacterium and Rhodobacteraceae bacterium) associated with N2O production were further identified. Overall, the settling of MPs could reshape the original biofilm and promote N2O production by selectively elevating sedimental microorganisms and functional genes in aquaculture pond. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The Mandalika Special Economic Zone (SEZ) offers beautiful coastal and underwater marine tourism. Marine tourism destinations around the Mandalika SEZ are Tanjung Aan Beach, Seger Beach, Gerupuk Beach, and Batu Berang Beach. This place is also the host of an international-scale agenda so that it will get domestic and foreign tourist visits that continue to increase. This can be a threat, especially in the aspect of waste that will disrupt environmental sustainability. Marine debris in the form of debris can reduce tourist visits which will lead to a decrease in income. A comprehensive mitigation strategy is needed to minimize negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems and human health. The purpose of this study is to analyze the amount and composition of marine debris based on location and typology as the basis for formulating marine debris mitigation efforts. The study was conducted in the Mandalika SEZ with a typology of sandy beaches, rocky beaches, and fishing areas, namely Tanjung Aan Beach, Batu Berang Beach, and Tanjung Aan Beach fishing locations. Types of data taken in the form of waste size (macro and meso), weight (M), composition (%), and density (K) of waste. Marine debris data was collected by survey method and mitigation strategy data was collected by distributing questionnaires to respondents. Analysis of the data in the form of size, weight, and density of waste quantitatively. The results showed that the characteristics of the waste from the three locations varied. The average density of macro waste on the coast of the Mandalika SEZ area is 0.05-0.08 items/m2, with the total dominant fabric material being 0.30 items/m2 and plastic 0.09 items/m2. Meanwhile, the average density of meso waste on the coast of the Mandalika SEZ area is 0.08-0.41 items/m2, which is dominated by wood material 0.41 items/m2, cloth material 0.24 items/m2 and plastic foam material 0.16 items/m2. From the results of interviews on mitigation strategies in the management of coastal areas from shipping waste or anthropogenic effects, including sorting organic and inorganic waste in various coastal typologies by visitors and managers by preparing facilities and infrastructure by tourism managers and village governments, selling anorganic waste in the form of plastic, rubber, fabric, glass, and ceramics in various coastal typologies for the welfare of local communities, as well as drafting regulations governing the management of marine debris in tourist areas as an economic potential. © 2024 Author(s).,\n",
       " As an emerging environmental pollutant, microplastics (MPs) have received widespread attention. Recently, studies examining microplastic pollution in plateau lakes have been increasing, but few have examined the distributions, sources, and fates of MPs in different plateau areas. In this work, the abundances and characteristics of MPs in surface waters and sediments in lakes of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP) were systematically investigated. The abundances of MPs in the lakes of the QTP ranges within 0.05–1.8 n/L in surface waters and 10–2643.7 n/kg in sediments. In the lakes of the YGP, the abundances of MPs ranged within 1.3–10.1 n/L in surface waters and 171.7–4260 n/kg in sediments. The dominant shape, color, and size class of MPs were fiber, transparent, and 0–0.5 mm in plateau lakes, respectively. MPs were mainly composed of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate polymers. The different sources of MPs in the QTP and YGP lakes were mainly due to differences in human activities. The primary sources of microplastic pollution in the lakes of the QTP were tourism and atmospheric transport, while sewage discharge, agriculture, and fishing activities were the main sources of MPs in urban lakes of the YGP. Although the level of microplastic pollution in plateau lakes was relatively low, the sources should be identified and monitored so that the effects and extent of microplastic pollution in these fragile environments can be fully understood. This study provides a valuable dataset and theoretical basis for subsequent research on microplastic pollution in plateau lakes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",

       " The increasing amount of nondegradable petroleum-based plastic waste releases chemical hazards, posing a significant threat to the environment and human health. Chitosan, derived from marine wastes, is an attractive feedstock for the preparation of plastic replacement due to its renewable and degradable nature. However, in most cases, complex chemical modifications of chitosan or hybridization with chemicals from fossil resources are required. Herein, we present a high-performance chitosan-based polyimine vitrimer (CS-PI) through a mild and catalyst-free Schiff base reaction between chitosan and vanillin. The CS-PI were formed by integrating dynamic imine bonds into the polymer networks, resulting in superior thermo-processability and mechanical performances. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of the CS-PI films reached 38.72 MPa and 3.20 GPa, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of both commercial petroleum-based plastics and bioplastics. Additionally, the CS-PI films exhibited good light transmittance, self-healing ability, reprocess capacity, water resistance, and durability to various organic solvents. Moreover, the CS-PI films could be completely degraded under both acidic and natural conditions, enabling a sustainable circulation. Therefore, this work offers a new design strategy for developing all-natural environmentally friendly polymers as sustainable replacements for petroleum-based plastics, thus reducing the accumulation of nondegradable plastic waste. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastics are commonly used by society and their break down into millimeter-sized bits known as microplastics (MPs). Due to the possibility of exposure, reports of them in atmospheric deposition, indoor, and outdoor air have sparked worry for public health. In tropical and subtropical regions all throughout the world, mangroves constitute a distinctive and significant type of coastal wetlands. Mangrove plants are considered to have the effect of accumulating sediment MPs, but the sedimentation of atmospheric MPs has not been reported. In this study, we illustrated the characteristics, abundance and spatial distribution of MPs in different species of mangrove leaves along the Seagull Island in Guangzhou. MPs samples from leaves in five species showed various shapes, colors, compositions, sizes and abundance. Acanthus ilicifolius had an average fallout rate of 1223 items/m2/day which has the highest abundance of MPs in all samples. Four shapes of MPs were found in all leaves surfaces including fiber, fragment, pellet, and film, with fiber is the most. The dominant types of MPs in all leaves were cellulose and rayon. Most of the total MPs size were smaller than 2 mm. Clearly, the microstructures of each species leaf surfaces had an impact on its ability to retain MPs. The plants rough blade surfaces and big folds or gullies caused more particles to accumulate and had a higher MPs retention capacity. Overall, our study contributes to a better knowledge of the condition of MPs pollution in atmosphere and the connection between leaves structure and the retention of MPs, which indicates that mangrove plants are promising bioindicator of coastal atmospheric MPs pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics pose a severe threat to marine ecosystems; however, relevant mathematical modeling and analysis are lacking. This paper formulates two stoichiometric producer-grazer models to investigate the interactive effects of microplastics, nutrients, and light on population dynamics under different settings. One model incorporates optimal microplastic uptake and foraging behavior based on nutrient availability for natural settings, while the other model does not include foraging in laboratory settings. We establish the well-posedness of the models and examine their long-term behaviors. Our results reveal that in natural environments, producers and grazers exhibit higher sensitivity to microplastics, and the system may demonstrate bistability or tristability. Moreover, the influences of microplastics, nutrients, and light intensity are highly intertwined. The presence of microplastics amplifies the constraints on grazer growth related to food quality and quantity imposed by extreme light intensities, while elevated phosphorus input enhances the system's resistance to intense light conditions. Furthermore, higher environmental microplastic levels do not always imply elevated microplastic body burdens in organisms, as organisms are also influenced by nutrients and light. We also find that grazers are more vulnerable to microplastics, compared to producers. If producers can utilize microplastics for growth, the system displays significantly greater resilience to microplastics. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " In mineral-rich areas, eutrophic lakes are at risk of HMs pollution. However, few papers focused on the repair of HMs in eutrophic environment. Our study analyzed multiple forms of HMs, pore structure and microbial responses in the water-sediment system of eutrophic lake treated with biochar, Effective Microorganisms (EMs) or/and microplastics (MPs). As biochar provided an ideal carrier for EMs, the remediation of biochar-supported EMs (BE) achieved the greatest repairment that improved the bacterial indexes and greatly decreased the most HMs in various forms across the water-sediment system, and it also reduced metal mobility, bioavailability and ecological risk. The addition of aged MPs (MP) stimulated the microbial activity and significantly reduced the HMs levels in different forms due to the adsorption of biofilms/EPS adhered on MPs, but it increased metals mobility and ecological risks. The strong adsorption and high mobility of aged MPs would increase enrichment of HMs and cause serious ecological hazards. The incorporation of BE and MP (MBE) also greatly reduced the HMs in full forms, which was primarily ascribed to the adsorption of superfluous biofilms/EPS, but it distinctly depressed the microbial activity. The single addition of biochar and EMs resulted in the inability of HMs to be adsorbed due to the preferentially adsorption of dissolved nutrients and the absence of effective carrier, respectively. In the remediation cases, the remarkable removal of HMs was principally accomplished by the adsorption of HMs with molecular weight below 100 kDa, especially 3 kDa ∼100 kDa, which had higher specific surfaces and abundant active matters, resulting in higher adsorption onto biofilms/EPS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " For marine invertebrates, the disruption of organismal physiology and behavior by nanoplastics (NPs) has been extensively reported. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are important for redundant protein breakdown, environmental changes, and intracellular protein transport. An exhaustive identification of Hsp70 genes and an experiment where different concentrations of NPs were stressed were performed to study how Hsp70 genes respond to NPs stress in Monodonta labio. Our results identified 15 members of Hsp70 within the genome of M. labio and provided insights into their responses to different concentrations of acute NP stress. Phylogenetic analyses revealed extensive amplification of the Hsp70 genes from the Hsc70 subfamily, with gene duplication events. As a result of NP stress, five of fifteen genes showed significant upregulation or downregulation. Three Hsp70 genes were highly expressed at an NP concentration of 0.1 mg/L, and no genes were downregulated. At 10 mg/L, they showed significant upregulation of two genes and significant downregulation of two genes. At 1 mg/L treatment, three genes were significantly downregulated, and no genes were significantly upregulated. Moreover, a purifying selection was revealed using a selection test conducted on duplicate gene pairs, indicating functional redundancy. This work is the first thorough examination of the Hsp70s in Archaeogastropoda. The findings improve knowledge of Hsp70s in molluscan adaptation to NP stress and intertidal living and offer essential data for the biological study of M. labio. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Measured microplastic concentrations in river surface waters fluctuate greatly. This variability is affected by season and is codriven by factors, such as sampling methodologies, sampling site, or sampling position within site. Unfortunately, most studies comprise single-instance measurements, whereas extended sampling periods are better suited to assessing the relevance of such factors. Moreover, microplastic concentrations in riverine water column remain underexplored. Similar to the oceans, however, this compartment likely holds significant amounts of microplastics. By representatively sampling the entire Rhine River cross-section near Basel through five sampling points over 22 months, we found a median microplastic (50-3000 μm) concentration of 4.48 n m-3, and estimated a widely ranging load between 4.04 × 102 n s-1 and 3.57 × 105 n s-1. We also show that the microplastic concentration in the water column was not well explained by river discharge. This suggests that although high discharge events as observed here can over short time periods lead to peak microplastic concentrations (e.g., 1.23 × 102 n m-3), microplastic load variance was not dominated by discharge in the study area. © 2024 The Authors.

       " Nanoplastics and microplastics (MPs) can significantly affect marine ecosystems and pose potential risks to human health. Although adverse effects stemming from direct exposure to MPs have been demonstrated at the cellular level in animal models, the potential toxicity of these materials in the human body remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the three-dimensional (3D) behavior of dermal-derived cells exposed to MPs using artificially manufactured spherical primary polystyrene (PS) particles. To explore these effects, we used cellular spheroids as a 3D cell culture model, examined the size-dependent penetration of PS-MPs, and observed morphological alterations in the spheroids. Furthermore, we assessed changes in physiological activities, including reactive oxygen species, adenosine triphosphate, and lactate dehydrogenase, to elucidate the potential intra- and extracellular toxic reactions to PS-MPs. Additionally, our examination of cell–cell junctions and the extracellular matrix (ECM), along with analysis of the regulators involved in their decreased integrity, revealed negatively influenced changes in expression. This exposure study using spheroid models provides new insights into the potential toxicity of short-term exposure to MPs under conditions that closely resemble in vivo systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Polystyrene (PS) is one of the main synthetic polymers produced around the world, and it is present in the composition of a wide variety of single-use objects. When released into the environment, these materials are degraded by environmental factors, resulting in microplastics. We investigated the ability of Chironomus sancticaroli (Diptera, Chironomidae) to promote the fragmentation of PS microspheres (24.5 ± 2.9 μm) and the toxic effects associated with exposure to this polymer. C. sancticaroli larvae were exposed to 3 different concentrations of PS (67.5, 135, and 270 particles g-1 of dry sediment) for 144 h. Significant lethality was observed only at the highest concentration. A significant reduction in PS particle size as well as evidence of deterioration on the surface of the spheres, such as grooves and cracks, was observed. In addition, changes in oxidative stress biomarkers (SOD, CAT, MDA, and GST) were also observed. This is the first study to report the ability of Chironomus sp. to promote the biofragmentation of microplastics. The information obtained demonstrates that the macroinvertebrate community can play a key role in the degradation of plastic particles present in the sediment of freshwater environments and can also be threatened by such particle pollution. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is a global concern that has a significant impact on marine life. Plastic is widely used and has become a pervasive pollutant in marine environments. Plastic contamination has been documented both in marine environments and biota. Plastic contamination in cetacean gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) content has received limited attention, especially in the Black Sea. This study aims to investigate plastic contamination in the GITs of bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises, introducing a novel methodology. Given the limited exploration of this issue in the Black Sea, the research predominantly focuses on microplastic contamination. The GITs were sampled through necropsy from stranded and by-caught cetaceans, and content was washed through a multi-sieves tool. The material retained on each sieve was analysed following specific protocols. All (100%) of the GITs contained plastics (meso- and microplastics). In total, 1059 items (fibres, fragments, and beads) ranging from 22.86 µm to 5776 µm were found, suggesting a high contamination level in the Black Sea cetaceans. Future efforts should concentrate on increasing the number of samples and using the results for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " The signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is one of the most widespread non-indigenous crayfish in Europe and is of interest to aquaculture in many countries. Once they escape into the wild, they disperse and become a potential source of food exploited for consumption by local inhabitants. The ingestion of plastics by the invasive signal crayfish in the Wieprza River, a tributary to the Baltic Sea, was determined by the FTIR identification of plastic compounds found in stomachs. The occurrence of plastic debris in the stomachs of P. leniusculus is reported for the first time. Plastic particles with the size range between 70 and 450 µm were observed only among crayfish inhabiting the lower, urbanized part of the river (7.3% of specimens). The presence of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), cellophane, PP (polypropylene), PE (polyethylene), PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), and nylon was confirmed with the highest frequency of PTFE in the stomachs of crayfish. Fibres were the predominant type of microplastics in crayfish stomachs. The results indicated the size-selective uptake and ingestion of plastics depending on the traits of the species and environment. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Nanoplastics are recognized as emerging contaminants that can cause severe toxicity to marine fishes. However, limited researches were focusing on the toxic effects of nanoplastics on marine fish, especially the post-exposure resilience. In this study, red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) were exposed to 5 mg/L polystyrene nanoplastics (100 nm, PS-NPs) for a 7-day exposure experiment, and a 14-day recovery experiment that followed. The aim was to evaluate the dynamic alterations in hepatic and branchial tissue damage, hepatic antioxidant capacity, as well as hepatic transcriptional and metabolic regulation in the red drum during exposure and post-exposure to PS-NPs. Histopathological observation found that PS-NPs primarily triggered hepatic lipid droplets and branchial epithelial liftings, a phenomenon persistently discernible up to the 14 days of recovery. Although antioxidant capacity partially recovered during recovery periods, PS-NPs resulted in a sustained reduction in hepatic antioxidant activity, causing oxidative damage throughout the entire exposure and recovery phases, as evidenced by decreased total superoxide dismutase activities and increased malondialdehyde content. At the transcriptional and metabolic level, PS-NPs primarily induced lipid metabolism disorders, DNA damage, biofilm disruption, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the gene-metabolite correlation interaction network, numerous CcO (cytochrome c oxidase) family genes and lipid metabolites were identified as key regulatory genes and metabolites in detoxification processes. Among them, the red drum possesses one additional CcO6B in comparison to human and zebrafish, which potentially contributes to its enhanced capacity for maintaining a stable and positive regulatory function in detoxification. This study revealed that nanoplastics cause severe biotoxicity to red drum, which may be detrimental to the survival of wild populations and affect the economics of farmed populations. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " This study aimed to assess the initial presence of microplastics on two sandy beaches along a rugged coastline in the Northwest Atlantic, an area with limited prior investigation. Sediment samples were collected from High, Mid, and Low intertidal zones at two beaches on the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. Microplastics were isolated from 100 g sediment samples using density flotation with a sodium iodide solution. Particle characterization included size, shape, and color analysis, with polymer identification performed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Results indicated that the predominant microplastics were small (< 1.4 mm) transparent microfibers, primarily composed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon, or alkyd polymers from paints. Mean concentrations were comparable between the two beaches, averaging 5.08 ± 3.20 and 5.58 ± 4.52 microplastics per 100 g of sediment, respectively. Non-plastic microfibers, including natural and semi-synthetic cellulosic materials, were notably more abundant, with mean concentrations ranging from 75.9 ± 60.1 to 97.7 ± 87.9 per 100 g sediment. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in microplastic counts across tidal zones due to high variability over small spatial scales (tens of meters). Sources of microfibers were potentially from high recreational use at these sites. This study highlights the lower-than-expected levels of microplastic pollution compared to earlier research at these sites and global beach studies. Future monitoring efforts could focus on longitudinal studies to track microplastic trends on these exposed sandy beaches. © The Author(s) 2024. Open Access.,\n",
       " The aim of this study was to assess the abundance of microplastics in the gastro-intestinal tracts of three commercially important fish species in the UK, to determine whether catch location, feeding habits and fish size influence the amount of microplastics within fish. Fish were collected from two rivers in the UK: the River Thames and the River Stour (East Anglia). Fish were collected from two sites in the River Thames and one site in the River Stour. Species selected were European flounder (Platichthys flesus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and were chosen to represent benthic and pelagic feeding habits. Across all locations, 41.5 % of fish had ingested at least one microplastic particle (37.5 % of European flounder, 52.2 % of whiting, and 28.6 % of Atlantic herring). The average number by species was 1.98 (±3.50) microplastics/fish in European flounder, 2.46 (±3.10) microplastics/fish in whiting and 1.47 (±3.17) microplastics/fish in herring. There were no significant differences in the number or mass of microplastics in fish based on river, site, species or habitat. However, the number and mass of microplastics within benthic fish (European flounder) in the River Stour were significantly higher than in benthic fish from the River Thames. By number of microplastics, larger and heavier fish were more highly contaminated. This study enhances our understanding of microplastics in commercially important fish but highlights that fish contamination is not easily predicted by feeding habits or catch location alone. Exposure and uptake is likely to vary with changing environmental conditions. Fish size tends to be a good predictor of contamination, with larger fish generally containing more microplastics. This is the first study to directly compare concentrations of microplastics in fish from different UK rivers and the first evidence of microplastics in the River Stour. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " After over 20 years of research on microplastic (MP) pollution, there are important areas of study which are still at the inception. In particular, between 2020 and 2023 new findings on MP have emerged, which open new sub-categories of MP research. These research areas include sea surface MP ejection, direct and indirect MP influence on climate and hydrological cycle, small and nano-sized MP analysis and the relationship between MP size and abundance.

Consequently, a plethora of scientific reports are being produced regarding the occurrence, distribution, and transfer pathways of litter particles.

This Special Issue (SI) aimed to provide an update on plastic pollution and its consequences on aquatic ecosystems, with a particular focus on biological domains, by adopting a multidisciplinary perspective. Several research articles and reviews were collected, focusing on the origin, fate, and effects of plastics in marine and freshwater environments, along with their interactions with biotic components.

       " The transport mechanisms of floating marine debris in coastal zones remain poorly understood due to complex geometries and the influence of coastal processes, posing difficulties in incorporating them into Lagrangian numerical models. The numerical model LOCATE overcomes these challenges by coupling Eulerian hydrodynamic data at varying resolutions within nested grids using Parcels, a Lagrangian particle solver, to accurately simulate the motion of plastic particles where a high spatial coverage and resolution are required to resolve coastal processes. Nested grids performed better than a coarse-resolution grid when analysing the model's dispersion skill by comparing drifter data and simulated trajectories. A sensitivity analysis of different beaching conditions comparing spatiotemporal beaching patterns demonstrated notable differences in the land-water boundary detection between nested hydrodynamic grids and high-resolution shoreline data. The latter formed the basis for a beaching module that parameterised beaching by calculating the particle distance to the shore during the simulation. A realistic debris discharge scenario comparison around the Barcelona coastline using the distance-based beaching module in conjunction with nested grids or a coarse-resolution grid revealed very high levels of particle beaching (>91.5%) in each case, demonstrating the importance of appropriately parameterising beaching at coastal scales. In this scenario, high variability in particle residence times and beaching patterns was observed between simulations. These differences derived from how each option resolved the shoreline, with particle residence times being much higher in areas of intricate shoreline configurations when using nested grids, thus resolving complex structures that were undetectable using the coarse-resolution grid. LOCATE can effectively integrate high-resolution hydrodynamic data within nested grids to model the dispersion and deposition patterns of particles at coastal scales using high-resolution shoreline data for shoreline detection uniformity.  © 2024 Ivan Hernandez et al.,\n",
       " Anthropogenic litter (AL), or trash, in urban rivers is abundant, mobile, and shows a wide diversity of types (e.g., plastic, metal, textiles) and input pathways. Previous work suggests AL can be moved along with naturally occurring organic matter (e.g., sediment, leaf litter, and wood) according to particle properties and stream hy-drology. Debris dams are key sites of organic matter retention in streams. AL likely accumulates in debris dams; how-ever, measurements of AL dynamics in debris dams and non-debris dam habitats in urban streams are uncommon, as are measurements of AL composition within different zones of debris dam structure. We measured AL density as count (no./m2) and mass (g/m2) in paired debris dam and non-debris dam sites in urban streams in Baltimore, Mary-land, USA and Chicago, Illinois, USA. Within debris dams, we recorded AL by 4 zones: 1) overhanging, 2) floating, 3) submerged, and 4) riparian. As expected, there was more AL within debris dams compared with non-debris dam hab-itats. Across all sites, most AL was composed of plastic materials, but we also noted distinctions in composition. Heavy items, such as ceramic materials, dominated non-debris dam sites, whereas expanded polystyrene and cigarette litter were more common in debris dams. Similarly, there was evidence of AL sorting within debris dams, with distinct composition between the floating (lightweight items) and submerged zones (heavy materials). AL composition in the ri-parian and overhanging zones showed no differences to one another or to the floating or submerged zones. Overall, AL had patchy distribution in streams and followed well-known processes that drive particle transport. Because debris dams are hot spots of biological activity, accumulation of AL within debris dams may facilitate interaction with stream biota. Improved understanding of the spatial distribution of AL within urban streams is valuable to improve models of AL density and movement at the watershed scale and to inform policies to prevent or remove AL from polluted sites. © 2024 The Society for Freshwater Science.

       " Plastic pollution has reached irreversible levels in both the terrestrial and marine environments affecting our planet's fauna and human health. Plastic debris originating from single-use plastic products (such as bags, cups, straws, etc.) has been reported in every natural habitat around the globe, and their fragmentation to micro and nano-plastics poses high risks for every organism, including humans. Political pressure and awareness campaigns over the past decades have led governments and the industry to adopt legislative measures to ban the use of single-use plastics and seek alternative solutions. Hence, single-use paper cups, straws, lids, packages, etc. started infiltrating our daily routine, as the most promising alternative to plastic products. However, there has been increasing research in recent years showing that single-use paper products can be harmful to both the environment and human health. This work reviewed the ongoing research on the hazards associated with the use of single-use plastic and paper products to assess whether paper is a viable solution to plastic. The findings reported here show that single-use paper products might be extremely harmful to both the terrestrial, fresh, and marine environment, as well as human health and climate change. This is due to the release of toxic chemical compounds directly into the environment (as in many cases these products are not recyclable) and the food/beverage (due to their rapid mechanical/compositional failure), and the release of greenhouse gases, upon degradation. Moreover, this study discusses consumer behavior from research performed in several countries and discusses that most consumers exhibit environmental consciousness, but require better incentives to use multi-use products and turn away from single-use products. Overall, the most promising solution to mitigate pollution from single-use products is to combine the environmental consciousness of consumers with economic measures (taxes, levies) for purchasing single-use products to reduce their usage. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MP) encompass not only plastic products but also paint particles. Marine microdebris, including MP, was retrieved from five sampling stations spanning Nagasaki-Goto island and was classified into six types, primarily consisting of MP (A), Si-based (B), and Cu-based (C) paint particles. Type-A particles, i.e., MP, were exceedingly small, with 74% of them having a long diameter of 25 µm or less. The vertical distribution of type C, containing cuprous oxide, exhibited no depth dependence, with its dominant size being less than 7 μm. It was considered that the presence of type C was associated with a natural phenomenon of MP loss. To clarify this, polypropylene (PP) samples containing cuprous oxide were prepared, and their accelerated degradation behavior was studied using a novel enhanced degradation method employing a sulfate ion radical as an initiator. Infrared spectroscopy revealed the formation of a copper soap compound in seawater. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis indicated that the chemical reactions between Cl− and cuprous oxide produced Cu+ ions. The acceleration of degradation induced by the copper soap formed was studied through the changes in the number of PP chain scissions, revealing that the presence of type-C accelerated MP degradation. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is ubiquitous in aquatic environments worldwide. Rivers connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems, playing a key role in the transport of land-based plastic waste towards the sea. Emerging research suggests that in estuaries and tidal rivers, tidal dynamics play a significant role in plastic transport and retention dynamics. To date, observations in these systems have been limited, and plastic transport dynamics during single tidal cycles remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated plastic transport, trapping, and re-mobilization of macroplastics (> 0.5 cm) in the Saigon River, focusing on short-term dynamics of individual tidal cycles. We used GPS trackers, released at different stages of the tidal cycle (ebb, flood, neap, spring). Plastic items demonstrated dynamic and intermittent transport behavior. Items spent almost half of the time (49%) temporarily stopped, mainly due to their entrapment in vegetation, infrastructure, or deposition on riverbanks. Items were almost always re-mobilized within 10 h (85%), leading to successive phases of stopping and transport. Tidal dynamics also resulted in bidirectional transport of plastic items, with median daily total transport distance within the 40 km study reach (8.9 km day−1) over four times larger than the median daily net distance (2.0 km day−1). The median retention time of plastic items within the reach was 21 days (mean = 202 days). In total, 81% of the retrieved items were trapped within water hyacinths, emphasizing the important role of floating vegetation on river plastic transport dynamics. With this paper, we aim to provide data-driven insights into macroplastic transport and retention dynamics in a tropical tidal river. These are crucial in the design of effective intervention and monitoring strategies, and estimating net plastic emission from rivers into the sea. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The escalation of litter accumulation in aquatic environments is recognized as an emerging global concern. Although rivers represent the main conduits for land-based waste into the oceans, the spatial dynamics of litter accumulation in these systems remain poorly investigated, especially after hydro-climatic extreme events. Floods have been identified as major drivers of litter mobilization, including macroplastics, within rivers. However, predicting flood-induced litter accumulation along riverbanks is complex due to the cumulative interplay of multiple environmental (geomorphological and riparian) and anthropogenic factors. Using empirical data collected from 14 stream reaches in two Northern Atlantic rivers in Portugal, our study evaluates which factors, among geomorphological, riparian, and anthropogenic descriptors, best drive riverside litter accumulation after floods. Taking into account the longitudinal gradient and the spatial heterogeneity of the studied reaches, our study enhances how the accumulation and characteristics (type, size) of riverside litter vary across a rural-urban continuum. Our model reveals that the combination of the human population density and the stream slope at river reach showed the highest explanatory power for the accumulation of riverside litter. Our findings indicate that litter tends to be retained close to the source, even under flood conditions. We also found that the structure of riparian vegetation showed low explanatory power for litter accumulation. However, riparian trapping could be influenced by litter input (density and type) which varies with anthropogenic activities. This work highlights the importance of gathering field data to identify critical areas of riverside litter accumulation within river basins. Our findings can further support environmental managers in designing and implementing effective cleanup campaigns and implementing plastic recovery strategies at specific areas. Nevertheless, it is crucial to enhance coordinated efforts across the entire value chain to reduce plastic pollution, promote innovative approaches for plastic litter valorization, and establish effective prevention pathways. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastics are rapidly accumulating in blue carbon ecosystems, i.e., mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows. Accumulated plastic is diverted from the ocean, but the extent and nature of impacts on blue carbon ecosystem processes, including carbon sequestration, are poorly known. Here, we explore the potential positive and negative consequences of plastic accumulation in blue carbon ecosystems. We highlight the effects of plastic accumulation on organic carbon stocks and sediment biogeochemistry through microbial metabolism. The notion of beneficial plastic accumulation in blue carbon ecosystems is controversial, yet considering the alternative impacts of plastics on oceanic and aboveground environments, this may be the “lesser of evils”. Using environmental life cycle impact assessment, we propose a research framework to address the potential positive and negative impacts of plastic accumulation in blue carbon ecosystems. Considering the multifaceted benefits, we prioritize expanding and managing blue carbon ecosystems, which may help with ecosystem conservation, as well as mitigating the negative effects of plastic. © 2024 American Chemical Society.,\n",
       " Polypropylene based medical devices significantly increased production and usage in COVID-19 pandemic states, and this material is very resilient in the environment. Thus, more than ever, rapid action is needed to reduce this pollution. This study focuses on the degradation of polypropylene microplastics (PP MPs) by unique marine bacterial strains obtained from the Thoundi (Bacillus tropicus, Bacillus cereus, Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila, and Brucella pseudintermedia) and Rameshwaram coasts (Bacillus cereus). Those above five bacterial strains were chosen after preliminary screening of their hydrophobicity, biofilm-forming capabilities, and responsiveness to the zone of clearance technique. During the biodegradation process (28 days), the growth, metabolic activity, and viability of these five isolates were all raised. After the post-biodegradation process, the weight loss percentages of the mentioned bacterial strains treated with PP MPs gradually decreased, with values of 51.5 ± 0.5 %, 47.5 ± 0.5 %, 33 ± 1 %, 28.5 ± 0.5 and 35.5 ± 0.5 %, respectively. UV-Vis DRS and SEM analysis confirmed that bacterial strains adhering to MPs cause cracks and cavities on their surface. The degradation of PP MPs can be inferred from alterations in the FT-IR spectrum, specifically in the carbonyl group range of 1100–1700 cm−1, as well as changes in the 1H NMR spectrum, including chemical shift and proton peak pattern alterations. Bacterial strains facilitated the degradation of PP MPs through the secretion of hydrolase-categorized enzymes of protease, lipase, and esterase. The findings of this study indicate that marine bacteria may possess distinctive characteristics that facilitate the degradation of plastic waste and contribute to environmental conservation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Owing to the degradation of plastics, microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have remained the focus of global attention. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could adversely affect marine organisms due to their broad application. So far, the combined effects of MPs/NPs (strong adsorbents) with AgNPs on marine organisms are scant. Thus, four sizes polystyrene beads (80 nm, 220 nm, 1.07 µm, and 2.14 µm) combined with AgNPs (30 nm) were assessed using ciliated protozoa Uronema marinum. Results showed that MPs/NPs dramatically decrease the abundance, biovolume, and carbon biomass of U. marinum. And, exposure could cause changes of antioxidant enzyme activity and antioxidant content on U. marinum. The combined toxicity of MPs/NPs with AgNPs to ciliates showed an enhanced effect compared to exposure alone. Additionally, the negative effects under exposure of NPs plus AgNPs were more significant than those of MPs plus AgNPs. Transcriptome sequencing showed that co-exposure could affect the energy metabolism and lipid metabolism of ciliates, even cause DNA and protein damage. Our study provided a novel insight and first-hand basic data for the understanding of combined toxicity of MPs /NPs with AgNPs on the basic trophic level ciliated protozoa in marine ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution has risen to such a level that concerns are being raised regarding its consequences on the environment, especially the marine environment. Understanding microplastic pollution temporal dynamics is critical but requires time-series. However, concerns about microplastic pollution being recent, long term monitoring programs have only started very recently and remain scarce. Natural History Collections that represent archives from the past can constitute time-series. Although underused, they have evinced their success to study various stressors including pollutants, in particular when using bioindicators. Bioindicator species should be defined with regards to the studied environmental disturbance according to established criteria. Those criteria include occurring frequently, being sensitive to the pollutant, and allowing, via their monitoring, a summary of the pollutant's impacts at molecular, organismal or population levels. However, to analyse bioindicator species in Natural History Collection time-series, several specificities need to be considered. Starting from a review of articles that utilised such collections to study microplastic evolution in a given ecosystem, and focusing on their methodologies, we emphasise Natural History Collection features that need to be taken into account when choosing the most adequate taxon and extraction techniques. In particular we discuss four collection features: sampling heterogeneity, taxonomic misidentification, past environmental contamination and specimen destruction and provide leads to address these issues. We believe that combining the concept of bioindicator with valuable samples from Natural History Collections is of particular interest to monitor past microplastic pollution and better predict future trends. This constitutes a necessary step in assessing the basal level and the continuing evolution of this ever-increasing pollution. © 2024,\n",
       " As an important principle of international environmental law, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (the CBDR principle) is being applied to various international environment protection regimes including environmental governance on the high seas as an important guiding principle in the law of the sea. This may be beneficial for engaging the international community to protect the high seas in solidarity. However, the application of the CBDR principle encounters difficulties, which include obstacles regarding cross-sector application, different understandings of the CBDR principle and difficulties in implementation of international instruments. This article argues that the differentiation should not depend exclusively on the traditional dichotomy of developing and developed countries but must be determined on a fluid and case-by-case basis. This suggests that the details of the differentiated responsibilities should also be context-specific rather than uniform for all States. Moreover, the implementation of the CBDR principle to address environmental problems on the high seas should be based on substantive fairness. Finally, this article makes several observations. First, the demands of developing countries in the field of maritime emission reduction should be considered. Second, obligation of capacity building and the transfer of marine technology prescribed in the BBNJ Agreement should be encouraged and implemented. Third, strengthening international cooperation in plastic pollution control on the high seas is expected. Fourth, the international community should provide developing countries with the financial support and technical assistance in persistent organic pollutants control. All of these may contribute to the protection of the high seas environment and the future realization of the sustainable development of the oceans. # The Author(s) 2024.

       " Microplastics (MPs) are one of the leading pollutants on the earth's surface and are found almost everywhere, including in aquatic environments. Microplastic pollution (MPP) on the oceanic surface is causing widespread concern among scientists and researchers worldwide due to its life-threatening impact on underwater living organisms. Excessive production of MP components and unscientific disposal caused severe issues for the marine ecosystem. Invertebrate corals and coral reefs in tropical and sub-tropical countries have suffered immensely from MP pollution and have shown a gradually decreasing trend of coral reef concentration on the oceanic surface. The bioaccumulation and ingestion of MP debris by the coral polyps have hindered the growth of the corals and forced coral bleaching. Most of the previous studies on MP have focused on the sources and distribution of MP. However, little is known about coral bleaching and its adverse impacts on the coral ecosystem. Therefore, the present review focuses on identifying sources, their global distribution, and the adverse effects of MP on the marine ecosystem, with particular reference to corals and coral reef ecosystems. The current study's findings highlighted that only a few countries and a few researchers worldwide have worked with MP pollution and its life-threatening impact on coral ecosystems. Earlier researchers showed fish communities' vulnerability to MPP in the aquatic environment. Hence, the present work recommends researching MPP and the worldwide threats to coral ecosystems. Apart from this, the production of MP should be minimized after the identification of MP sources, regular monitoring of aquatic ecosystems, recycling of MP elements, and strict government policies to slow down the dreadful impact of MP on coral reef ecosystems and marine environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs), small synthetic particles, have emerged as perilous chemical pollutants in aquatic habitats, causing grave concerns about their disruptive effects on ecosystems. The fauna and flora inhabiting these specific environments consume these MPs, unwittingly introducing them into the intricate web of the food chain. In this comprehensive evaluation, the current methods of identifying MPs are amalgamated and their profound impacts on marine and freshwater ecosystems are discussed. There are many potential risks associated with MPs, including the dangers of ingestion and entanglement, as well as internal injuries and digestive obstructions, both marine and freshwater organisms. In this review, the merits and limitations of diverse identification techniques are discussed, including spanning chemical analysis, thermal identification, and spectroscopic imaging such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescent microscopy. Additionally, it discusses the prevalence of MPs, the factors that affect their release into aquatic ecosystems, as well as their plausible impact on various aquatic ecosystems. Considering these disconcerting findings, it is imperative that appropriate measures should be taken to assess the potential risks of MP pollution, protect aquatic life and human health, and foster sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Annually, the Mediterranean region attracts around one-third of the global coastal tourism, which is acknowledged as a substantial contributor to plastic pollution. Coastal municipalities mitigate this through periodic sand and shore cleaning. However, the efficacy of these measures remains uncertain. In this study, the occurrence of MPs (10 μm-5 mm) in sand from seven different, regularly cleaned, touristic beaches of the coastline of Valencia province (E Spain) was assessed. Two different sampling campaigns were performed in winter and in summer (2022) to compare the results and understand the influence of the high touristic activity, as well as, the efficiency of the measures taken against MPs pollution. The methodology used was designed specifically for the matrix and employed density separation using a Sediment Microplastic Isolation (SMI) Unit. In addition to conventional visual inspection and ATR-FTIR, automatic quantification and identification of the polymers of lower size was performed by μFTIR. The average MPs concentration in the summer (339 ± 92 MP kg−1 by stereomicroscopy and 339 ± 189 MP kg−1 by μFTIR) was significantly higher than in the winter (71 ± 92 MP kg−1 and 143 ± 85 MP kg−1) (p < 0.05). The combination of these analytical tools provides comprehensive information about the MPs present in beach sand. Fibers were the most abundant form of MPs, while most of the polymers analyzed were polyethylene (PE) and halogenated polystyrene (Cl-PS and Br-PS) with food packaging, swimming equipment and fishing nets being their most probable sources. Ecological risk assessment was performed through the Pollution Load Index (PLI), the Hazardous Index (HI) and the Risk Quotient (RQ), with the results indicating potential risk that ranges from moderate to high depending on the applied approach. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Rivers are the principal route for terrestrial microplastics to reach the marine environment. The Black Sea exhibits a notable representation because it has a drainage zone almost six times the surface area and is semi-closed, meaning that microplastics tend to gather there. To mitigate MP pollution, it is necessary to identify the contamination sources and then raise public awareness. Thus, the current study focused on the MP presence in the sediment of streams running into the SE Black Sea. 594 MPs were observed in sediment samples from 16 stations along the 350 km coastline. The abundance of MP was higher, particularly in streams that pass through locations with high tourism and industrial activity levels. Detected MPs ranged between 0.1 and 5 mm, while the overall density was smaller than 1 mm. Fragments and fiber MPs were regularly detected, although the presence of films was rarely recorded. The polymer structures that were most commonly observed in the analyzed pollutants were PET and PE. The current study uncovered MP contamination in stream sediments originating from Türkiye's Eastern Black Sea basin and might be a baseline work for future inland water studies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Many coastal nations have endorsed the Blue Economy as both an economic and environmental opportunity, despite numerous questions as to how industrial expansion into deep ocean waters might be regulated for sustainability. Aquaculture is one industry actively promoting a move offshore, with numerous offshore leases in development. Drawing on the history of aquaculture in the nearshore, and relying on a processual approach to property, we explore questions around the regulation of privatized ocean spaces: What can court cases involving aquaculture in the nearshore tell us about the role of law in promoting sustainable offshore ocean spaces? And what in turn does this suggest about extractive capitalism, the privatization of ocean spaces, and the law? We examine 46 Canadian court cases which cover a 30-year time frame and multiple Canadian jurisdictions. We argue that there are lessons here regarding the questionable ability of law to effectively regulate existing or future aquaculture operations once privatization emerges. The lessons from these Canadian court cases, taken together with a burgeoning literature on legal geography, more-than-human methodologies, and critical environmental law, suggest the varied legal dimensions of deep-sea aquaculture frontier imaginaries and highlight the real limits to regulating the extraction of resources in this perceived open space (terra nullius). We highlight crucial barriers to sustainability through what we are calling jurisdictional opaqueness in regulatory issues. The results include poor regulation and overlapping or contested jurisdictions, which relates in turn to inadequate consultation, frequent environmental problems (toxic chemicals, anoxia, salmon escapes, marine debris), and scientific disputes. © 2024, The Author(s).,\n",
       " Background: Microplastics (MPs) are found in all environments: aquatic, airborne, and terrestrial. While their presence is not disputed, their potential impacts are not yet known. Objective: To undertake a pilot analysis of MP contamination in archaeological sediment samples, taken in the late 1980s from two archaeological excavation sites in the historic city of York (UK) as well as contemporary sources close to the same sites, with respect to the presence (if any), levels, and characteristics of any particles identified. Methods: This study analysed pre-digested sediment samples as follows: n = 3 from Queens Hotel (QH) site and n = 3 Wellington Row (WR) contemporary core-source, and n = 3 QH and n = 3 WR archival-source samples, alongside procedural controls (n = 8), using μFTIR spectroscopy (size limitation of 5 μm) to detect and characterise any MPs present. Results: In total, 66 MP particles consisting of 16 MP polymer types were identified across both site and contemporary/archived samples. The highest levels of MP particles, 20,588 MP/kg was identified at the lowest sample depth (∼7.35 m) at archived WR, 5910 MP/kg in the mid depth layer (∼5.85 m) at the contemporary QH site. Of the MPs detected in sediment samples overall, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polybutylene sulfone (PSU), and polypropylene: polyethylene (PE:PP) copolymer polymer types were most abundant; mainly fragmented and irregular shape. Conclusions: This is believed to be the first evidence of MP contamination in archaeological sediment (or soil) samples with polymers and size ranges measured and while accounting for procedural blanks. These results support the phenomenon of transport of MPs within archaeological stratigraphy, and the characterisation of types, shapes and size ranges identified therein. Through contamination, MPs may compromise the scientific value of archaeological deposits, and environmental proxies suspended within significant sediment, and as such represent a new consideration in the dynamism of, as well as arguments for preserving, archaeological deposits in situ. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Environmental contamination by plastics has been receiving considerable attention from scientists, policy makers and the public, and waste plastic trade has become a major social issue in recent years. In this study, the authors applied eco-hydrology model coupled with plastic debris model in Asian regions by including effect of waste plastic trade in order to clarify this research gap. Result showed settling and resuspension of plastic particles have great impact on mobilisation of plastic and its high intra-annual variability, and that the plastic transport becomes drastically higher during the flood periods accounting for most of the annual flux. In particular, the model simulated the size distribution of plastics in the water and riverbed sediment of the global major rivers and showed that the coarser particles are more distributed in the riverbed than those in the water. Further, the authors evaluated impact of waste plastic trade on change in riverine plastic transport by newly including effect of plastic trade on Mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) in the extension of previous studies. They newly modified to calculate municipal plastic waste by including these effects of plastic trade and disposal, and revised MPW assuming that the import of plastics is treated as the same as the export of plastics as the first approximation, which is the innovation of this study. The modified MPW became smaller than the original one in the exporting countries and vice versa in the importing countries. Further, this analysis clarified waste plastic trade has promoted decrease of riverine plastic transport in Japanese rivers, its slight increase in Yangtze, Yellow, and Ganges Rivers, and almost its constant in Mekong, Indus, Irrawaddy, and Brahmaputra Rivers. Recently, there is a growing progress in compiling existing research results and setting policy making in various countries under the umbrella of an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) on plastic pollution. The present results help to quantify plastic trade-off about impact of export and import of waste plastic on plastic dynamics in regional scale and to support the achievement of sustainable development goals (SGDs). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution has emerged as a critical environmental issue with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and human health. These are plastic particles measuring <5 mm and are categorized as primary and secondary based on their origin. Primary MPs are used in various products like cosmetics, scrubs, body wash, and toothpaste, while secondary MPs are generated through the degradation of plastic products. These have been detected in seas, rivers, snow, indoor air, and seafood, posing potential risks to human health through the food chain. Detecting and quantifying MPs are essential to understand their distribution and abundance in the environment. Various microscopic (fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy) and spectroscopy techniques (FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) have been reported to analyse MPs. Despite the challenges in scalable removal methods, biological systems have emerged as promising options for eco-friendly MPs remediation. Algae, bacteria, and fungi have shown the potential to adsorb and degrade MPs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) offering hope for mitigating this global crisis. This review examines the sources, impacts, detection, and biological removal of MPs, highlighting future directions in this crucial field of environmental conservation. By fostering global collaboration and innovative research a path towards a cleaner and healthier planet for future generations can be promised. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have attracted growing attention worldwide as an increasingly prevalent environmental pollutant. In addition, chicken meat is currently the most widely consumed kind of poultry in the global market. Consumer demand for chicken is on the rise both at home and abroad. As a result, the safety of chicken raising has also received significant attention. The lungs play an essential role in the physiological activities of chickens, and they are also the most vulnerable organs. Lung injury is difficult to repair after the accumulation of contaminants, and the mortality rate is high, which brings huge economic losses to farmers. The research on the toxicity of MPs has mainly focused on the marine ecosystem, while the mechanisms of toxicity and lung damage in chickens have been poorly studied. Thus, this study explored the effects of exposure to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) at various concentrations for 42 d on chicken lungs. PS-MPs could cause lung pathologies and ultrastructural abnormalities, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) swelling, inflammatory cell infiltration, chromatin agglutination, and plasma membrane rupture. Simultaneously, PS-MPs increased the expression of genes related to the heat shock protein family (Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90), ER stress signaling (activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6),ATF4, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit a (eIF2α)), pyroptosis-related genes (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase 1 (Caspase1), and gasdermin-D (GSDMD)), and the inflammatory signaling pathway (nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)). The above results showed that PS-MP exposure could result in lung stress, ER stress, pyroptosis, and inflammation in broilers. Our findings provide new scientific clues for further research on the mechanisms of physical health and toxicology regarding MPs. © Zhejiang University Press 2024.,\n",
       " Anthropogenic influences such as plastic pollution are causing serious environmental problems. While effects of microplastics on marine organisms are well studied, less is known about effects of plastic particles on terrestrial organisms such as plants. We investigated the effects of microplastic particles on different growth and metabolic traits of savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda). Sections of seedlings exposed to polystyrene particles were analysed by coherent Raman scattering microscopy. These analyses revealed an uptake of particles in a size range of 0.5 µm to 2.0 µm into cells of the hypocotyl. Furthermore, plants were grown in substrate amended with polyethylene and polystyrene particles of different sizes (s1: 200–500 µm; s2: 100–200 µm; s3: 20–100 µm; s4: < 100 µm, with most particles < 20 µm; s5: < 20 µm) and in different concentrations (c1 = 0.1%, c2 = 0.01%, c3 = 0.001%). After several weeks, shoot and root biomass were harvested. Leaves were analysed for their carbon to nitrogen ratio, while amino acid and glucosinolate composition were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Plastic type, particle size and concentration showed distinct effects on certain plant traits. Shoot biomass was interactively influenced by size and concentration of polyethylene, while root biomass was not modified by any of the plastic exposure treatments. Likewise, the composition and total concentrations of leaf amino acids were not affected, but the leucine concentration was significantly increased in several of the plastic-exposed plants. Glucosinolates were also slightly altered, depending on the particle size. Some of the observed effects may be independent of plastic uptake, as larger particles were not taken up but still could affect plant traits. For example, in the rhizosphere plastic particles may increase the water holding capacity of the soil, impacting some of the plant traits. In summary, this study shows how important the plastic type, particle size and concentration are for the uptake of microplastics and their effects on plant traits, which may have important implications for crops, but also for ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The use of novel and inexpensive catalysts as replacements for platinum is desirable. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that cost-effective metal oxide nanomaterials and the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) can be directly chemically synthesized on carbon microfiber electrodes to improve the performance of lake sediment inoculated MFCs. Nanomaterial of MnO2, MnO2/polyaniline (PANI), ZnO/NiO and ZnO/NiO/PANI attachments were directly chemically synthesized on the carbon material and used as cathode electrodes. The maximum power densities recorded for the different treatments were; MnO2 78.5 mW/m2, MnO2/PANI (Polyaniline) 141.6 mW/m2, ZnO/NiO 67.6 mW/m2, and ZnO/NiO/PANI 129.4 mW/m2. Current and power densities were more than six-fold higher in ZnO/NiO/PANI and MnO2/PANI nanoparticle modified cathodes compared to the control MFCs with no catalyst and more than 2.5 fold higher compared to Pt loaded conventional cathodes. In-excess of 50-fold reductions in catalyst application costs to obtain a unit amount of power was demonstrated with the novel nanomaterials direct deposition method when compared to traditional catalysts such as Pt. This study demonstrates that nanomaterials-incorporated carbon microfiber cathodes bring about significant enhancements to power densities and may potentially have applications in cost-effective MFCs. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have gained global concern due to their detrimental effects on marine organisms. We investigated the effects of 80 nm polystyrene (PS) NPs on life history traits, ingestion, and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) production in the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. Fluorescently labeled 80 nm PS NPs were ingested by the rotifer B. plicatilis and accumulated in the digestive tract. The lethal rates of B. plicatilis exposed to NPs were dose-dependent. High concentrations of PS NPs exposure had negative effects on developmental duration, leading to prolonged embryonic development and pre-reproductive periods, shortened reproductive period, post-reproductive period, and lifespan in B. plicatilis. High concentrations of PS NPs exposure inhibited life table demographic parameters such as age-specific survivorship and fecundity, generation time, net reproductive rate, and life expectancy. Consequently, the population of B. plicatilis was adversely impacted. Furthermore, exposure to PS NPs resulted in a reduced ingestion rate in B. plicatilis, as well as a decreased in DMS, particulate DMSP (DMSPp) concentration, and DMSP lyase activity (DLA), which exhibited a dose-response relationship. B. plicatilis grazing promoted DLA and therefore increased DMS production. PS NPs exposure caused a decline in the increased DMS induced by rotifer grazing. Our results help to understand the ecotoxicity of NPs on rotifer and their impact on the biogeochemical cycle of dimethylated sulfur compounds. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) were investigated at 19 sandy beaches along the eastern Mediterranean Moroccan coast. Sediment samples (5 mm–63 μm) were analyzed to identify MPs abundance, size, shape, color and nature. MPs concentration ranged from 40 ± 7.4 to 230 ± 48.6 MPs kg−1; fibrous MPs were the most abundant (74.72 %), followed by fragments (20.26 %), films (3.27 %), pellets (1.42 %) and foams (0.33 %). Large MPs (1–5 mm) accounted for 58 %, while small (< 1 mm) for 42 %. The 1–2 mm fraction of sediments presented the greatest amounts (30.67 %) of MPs. Transparent (50 %) and blue (17 %) were most common colors and most of particles were angular and irregularly shaped. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that PE (Polyethylene), PS (Polystyrene) and PP (Polypropylene) and PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) were the most common polymers. These findings revealed a moderate level of microplastic pollution along the beaches of the eastern Moroccan Mediterranean coast. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics (MP) which are tiny plastic particles of sizes range from 1 μm (μm) to 5 mm (mm), have become a growing cause of concern due to their widespread presence in the environment and their potential impacts on ecosystems and human health. Marine organisms have the potential to consume microplastics, which could lead to physical injuries, blockages, or the transfer of harmful substances up the food chain. Humans may indirectly consume microplastics through contaminated seafood and water, although the complete scope of health risks is currently under investigation. An essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of microplastic pollution in waterbodies is the identification of microplastics, which is also crucial for further development of effective environmental regulations to address its adverse impacts. Majority of the researchers are accomplishing it globally using commercial platforms based on Raman spectroscopy. However, the development of indigenous Raman systems, which can enable microplastic identification, particularly in developing nations, is the need of the hour due to the outrageous cost of commercial platforms. In the current study, a custom-designed micro-Raman spectroscopy system was developed to detect and characterize microplastics from waterbodies. The developed system enabled visualization, size measurement and characterization of microplastics. Experimental parameters were fine-tuned, and a standardized Raman database was established for each type of plastic. This system exhibited high resolution which was capable of analysing microparticles of size up to 5 μm. Principal component analysis was carried out on the experimental Raman data, demonstrating good classification amongst different kinds of plastics. The performance of the developed system in analysing real samples was evaluated through experiments conducted on water samples obtained from the shore of Malpe Beach in Udupi district. The results revealed the presence of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate in the samples, along with the detection of pigments like copper phthalocyanine and indigo blue. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are pervasive pollutants in the marine environment, exerting adverse effects on marine organisms. While it is suggested that their exposure may compromise the immune responses of marine organisms, the cumulative immunotoxic effects remain uncertain. Additionally, the intricate mechanisms underlying the immunotoxicity of PCBs and MPs in marine organisms are not yet fully comprehended. To illuminate their combined biological impacts, Crassostrea gigas were exposed to 50 μg/L MPs (30-μm porous) alone, as well as 10 or 100 ng/L PCBs individually or in combination with 50 μg/L of MPs for 28 days. Our data demonstrated that oysters treated with the pollutants examined led to decreased total haemocyte count, inhibited phagocytosis of haemocytes, enhanced the intracellular contents of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, reduced lysozyme concentration and activity, gave rise to superoxide dismutase. Catalaseand glutathione S-transferaseactivity. The expression of three immune-related genes (NF-κB, TNF-α, TLR-6) was drastically suppressed by the PCBs and MPs treatment, while the apoptosis pathway-related genes (BAX and Caspase-3) showed a significant increase. In addition, compared to oysters treated with a single type of pollutant, coexposure to MPs and PCBs exerted more severe adverse impacts on all the parameters investigated, indicating a significant synergistic effect. Therefore, the risk of MPs and PCBs chemicals on marine organisms should be paid more attention. © 2024,\n",
       " Phthalates are widely employed plasticizers blended to plastic polymers that, during plastic aging and weathering are prone to leach in the surrounding environment. Thus, phthalates were proposed to indirectly evaluate MPs contamination in marine environments, with still uncertain and scarce data, particularly for wildlife. This study investigates simultaneously microplastics (MPs) and phthalates (PAEs) occurrence in wild Actinia equina and Anemonia viridis, two common and edible sea anemone species. Both species had a 100 % frequency of MPs occurrence, with similar average concentrations. PAEs were detected in 70 % of samples, with concentrations up to 150 ng/g in A. equina and 144.3 ng/g for A. viridis. MPs and PAEs present in sea anemone tissues appear to reflect seawater plastic contamination conditions in the study area. Given the rapid biodegradation of PAEs, occurrence and concentrations of both these additives and their metabolites could be useful tracers of short-term plastic debris-biota interactions. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution's impact on the marine ecosystem is widely recognized. This study compared the effects of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on two bivalve species, Ruditapes philippinarum (clam) and Chlamys farreri (scallop), at two particle concentrations (10 and 1000 μg/L). MPs were found in the digestive glands and gills of both species. Although clearance rates showed no significant changes, exposure to different MPs caused oxidative stress, energy disruption, and lipid metabolism disorders in both clam and scallop. Histopathological damage was observed in gills and digestive glands. IBR values indicated increasing toxicity with concentration, with PET being more toxic than PE. WOE model suggested increasing hazard with concentration, highlighting higher PET toxicity on clam digestive glands. In contrast, PE hazard increased in gills, showing different species responses. R. philippinarum exhibited higher sensitivity to MPs than C. farreri, providing insights for assessing ecological risk under realistic conditions and stress conditions. © 2024,\n",
       " Mangrove wetlands are hotspots of the global nitrogen (N) cycle and important sinks of microplastics (MPs) due to their ecotone location between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, the effects of MPs on N cycle processes in mangrove ecosystems are still poorly understood. Thus, the present study assessed the impacts by adding MPs to mangrove sediments in a microcosm incubation experiment. The results showed that MPs increased dissolved organic carbon and nitrate but reduced ammonium contents in the sediments. MPs increased C:N stoichiometric and N:C-acquiring enzymatic ratios, indicating an intensified N limitation in mangrove sediments following exposure of MPs. MPs decreased microbial community diversity and shifted sediment microbial communities from r- to K-strategists, consistent with the intensified N limitation. In response, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates increased while nitrous oxide (N2O) production reduced suggesting more efficient N utilization in MPs treatments. The MPs with heteroatoms such as PLA- and PVC-MPs, increased DNRA rates by 67.5–78.7%, exhibiting a stronger impact than PE-MPs. The variation partitioning analysis revealed that the variances of DNRA rates and N2O production could be attributed to synergistic effects of physicochemical properties, nutrient limitation, and microbial community in mangrove sediments. Overall, this study provides pertinent insights into the impacts of MPs as a new carbon source on nutrient limitation and N turnover in mangrove ecosystems. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pose a threat to ecosystems due to their capacity to bind with toxic chemicals. While the occurrence of MPs in aquatic environmental matrices like water, sediments, and biota is well studied, their presence in the atmosphere remains less understood. This study aimed to determine the presence of airborne MPs and their characteristics through ground-based sampling in the coastal city of Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia. Airborne MP samples were collected using passive sampling technique in December 2019. MPs were manually counted and identified using a stereomicroscope based on their colour and shape. The average deposition rate of airborne MPs during the sampling period was 5476 ± 3796 particles/m2/day, ranging from 576 to 15,562 particles/m2/day. Various colours such as transparent (38%), blue (25%), black (20%), red (13%), and others (4%) were observed. The predominant shape of airborne MPs was fibres (> 99%). The morphology structure of MPs observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed a cracked surface on MPs, suggesting weathering and irregular fragmentation. Further elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed the presence of heavy metals such as aluminium (Al) and cadmium (Cd) on the surface of MPs, attributed to the adsorption capacities of MPs. Polymer types of airborne MPs were analysed using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), which revealed particles composed of polyester (PES), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). The preliminary findings could provide additional information for further investigations of MPs, especially in the atmosphere, to better understand their sources and potential human exposure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " The commercial shrimping industry is subjected to myriad stressors that have led to financial hardships among industry members. One of these stressors is marine debris; however, there is limited understanding of the type and magnitude of impacts. Quantitative methods of estimating the economic impacts of marine debris on the commercial shrimping industry were developed. From June to December 2019, participating shrimpers submitted 393 daily summaries, including shrimping activities, marine debris encounters, damages, and impacts. The impacts of marine debris encounters were assessed from reports of daily damages to fishing assets, daily lost fishing time, daily loss-catch ratios, and daily catch losses. The results of this study demonstrate substantial negative economic impacts on commercial shrimpers related to marine debris encounters. About 17 % of shrimp caught were lost due to marine debris encounters, resulting in foregone total sales and job impacts of $3.2 million and 33 jobs in shrimping and associated businesses. © 2024,\n",
       " Several studies have focused on identifying and quantifying suspended plastics in surface and subsurface seawater. Microplastics (MPs) have attracted attention as carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the marine environment. Plastispheres, specific biofilms on MP, can provide an ideal niche to spread more widely through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), thereby increasing risks to ecosystems and human health. However, the microbial communities formed on different plastic types and ARG abundances during exposure time in natural marine environments remain unclear. Four types of commonly used MPs (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were periodically cultured (46, 63, and 102 d) in a field-based marine environment to study the co-selection of ARGs and microbial communities in marine plastispheres. After the first 63 d of incubation (p < 0.05), the initial 16S rRNA gene abundance of microorganisms in the plastisphere increased significantly, and the biomass subsequently decreased. These results suggest that MPs can serve as vehicles for various microorganisms to travel to different environments and eventually provide a niche for a variety of microorganisms. Additionally, the qPCR results showed that MPs selectively enriched ARGs. In particular, tetA, tetQ, sul1, and qnrS were selectively enriched in the PVC-MPs. The abundances of intl1, a mobile genetic element, was measured in all MP types for 46 d (5.22 × 10−5 ± 8.21 × 10−6 copies/16s rRNA gene copies), 63 d (5.90 × 10−5 ± 2.49 × 10−6 copies/16s rRNA gene copies), and 102 d (4.00 × 10−5 ± 5.11 × 10−6 copies/16s rRNA gene copies). Network analysis indicated that ARG profiles co-occurred with key biofilm-forming bacteria. This study suggests that the selection of ARGs and their co-occurring bacteria in MPs could potentially accelerate their transmission through HGT in natural marine plastics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and pesticides are two categories contaminants with proposed negative impacts to aqueous ecosystems, and adsorption of pesticides on MPs may result in their long-range transport and compound combination effects. Florpyrauxifen-benzyl, a novel pyridine-2-carboxylate auxin herbicide has been widely used to control weeds in paddy field, but the insights of which are extremely limited. Therefore, adsorption and desorption behaviors of florpyrauxifen-benzyl on polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE) and disposable face masks (DFMs) in five water environment were investigated. The impacts of various environmental factors on adsorption capacity were evaluated, as well as adsorption mechanisms. The results revealed significant variations in adsorption capacity of florpyrauxifen-benzyl on three MPs, with approximately order of DFMs > PE > PVC. The discrepancy can be attributed to differences in structural and physicochemical properties, as evidenced by various characterization analysis. The kinetics and isotherm of florpyrauxifen-benzyl on three MPs were suitable for different models, wherein physical force predominantly governed adsorption process. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that both high and low temperatures weakened PE and DFMs adsorption, whereas temperature exhibited negligible impact on PVC adsorption. The adsorption capacity was significantly influenced by most environmental factors, particularly pH, cations and coexisting herbicide. This study provides valuable insights into the fate of florpyrauxifen-benzyl in presence of MPs, suggesting that PVC, PE and DFMs can serve as carriers of florpyrauxifen-benzyl in aquatic environment. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics are a global ecological concern due to their potential risk to wildlife and human health. Animals ingest microplastics, which can enter the trophic chain and ultimately impact human well-being. The ingestion of microplastics can cause physical and chemical damage to the animals' digestive systems, affecting their health. To estimate the risk to ecosystems and human health, it is crucial to understand the accumulation and localization of ingested microplastics within the cells and tissues of living organisms. However, analyzing this issue is challenging due to the risk of sample contamination, given the ubiquity of microplastics. Here, an analytical approach is employed to confirm the internalization of microplastics in cryogenic cross-sections of mussel tissue. Using 3D Raman confocal microscopy in combination with chemometrics, microplastics measuring 1 μm in size were detected. The results were further validated using optical and fluorescence microscopy. The findings revealed evidence of microplastics being internalized in the digestive epithelial tissues of exposed mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), specifically within the digestive cells forming digestive alveoli. This study highlights the need to investigate the internalization of microplastics in organisms like mussels, as it helps us understand the potential risks they pose to aquatic biota and ultimately to human health. By employing advanced imaging techniques, challenges associated with sample contamination can be overcome and valuable insights into the impact of microplastics on marine ecosystems and human consumers are provided. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are found in aquatic environments all over the world. Among MPs, tire wear particles (TWPs) are a major contributor to microplastic pollution, and their effects on marine ecosystems are of emerging concern. The blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) is a keystone species in coastal ecosystems with a high risk of exposure to microplastic pollution as the microplastics often overlap in size with the plankton consumed by mussels. In the present study, we investigated the effect of tire particles and their leachates on the filtration rates of M. edulis after short (72 h) and long-term (3 weeks) exposure. Acute exposure to leachates alone causes a significant decrease in the filtration rates of M. edulis with a low observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 1.25 g L−1 and a median effect concentration (EC50) = 3 g L−1. At a concentration of 1.25 g L−1, the filtration rate was reduced compared to the control on average by 38% when mussels were exposed to either TWP or leachates for 72 h. Similarly, mussels exposed to tire particles or their leachates for 3 weeks showed a 46% reduction in filtration rates, compared to the control group. A non-significant difference in filtration rate decrease was found between leachates alone or TWP, which indicates that leachates are the main responsible for the observed toxicity. Our findings indicate that elevated levels of TWP pollution can cause an adverse impact on M. edulis. This could disrupt the natural grazing pressure exerted by M. edulis on phytoplankton, potentially leading to an increased likelihood of algal blooms and hypoxia occurrence in coastal ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Micro/nanoplastics (MNPs) have emerged as a significant environmental concern due to their widespread distribution and potential adverse effects on human health and the environment. In this study, to integrate exposure and toxicity pathways of MNPs, a comprehensive review of the occurrence, toxicokinetics (absorption, distribution, and excretion [ADE]), and toxicity of MNPs were investigated using the aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) and adverse outcome pathway (AOP) frameworks. Eighty-five papers were selected: 34 papers were on detecting MNPs in environmental samples, 38 papers were on the ADE of MNPs in humans and fish, and 36 papers were related to MNPs toxicity using experimental models. This review not only summarizes individual studies but also presents a preliminary AEP-AOP framework. This framework offers a comprehensive overview of pathways, enabling a clearer visualization of intricate processes spanning from environmental media, absorption, distribution, and molecular effects to adverse outcomes. Overall, this review emphasizes the importance of integrating exposure and toxicity pathways of MNPs by utilizing AEP-AOP to comprehensively understand their impacts on human and ecological organisms. The findings contribute to highlighting the need for further research to fill the existing knowledge gaps in this field and the development of more effective strategies for the safe management of MNPs. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics, which have a diameter of less than 5 mm, are becoming an increasingly prevalent contaminant in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to the dramatic increase in plastic production to 390.7 million tonnes in 2021. Among all the plastics produced since 1950, nearly 80% ended up in the environment or landfills and eventually reached the oceans. Currently, 82–358 trillion plastic particles, equivalent to 1.1–4.9 million tonnes by weight, are floating on the ocean's surface. The interactions between microorganisms and microplastics have led to the transportation of other associated pollutants to higher trophic levels of the food chain, where microplastics eventually reach plants, animals, and top predators. This review paper focuses on the interactions and origins of microplastics in diverse environmental compartments that involve terrestrial and aquatic food chains. The present review study also critically discusses the toxicity potential of microplastics in the food chain. This systematic review critically identified 206 publications from 2010 to 2022, specifically reported on microplastic transport and ecotoxicological impact in aquatic and terrestrial food chains. Based on the ScienceDirect database, the total number of studies with “microplastic” as the keyword in their title increased from 75 to 4813 between 2010 and 2022. Furthermore, various contaminants are discussed, including how microplastics act as a vector to reach organisms after ingestion. This review paper would provide useful perspectives in comprehending the possible effects of microplastics and associated contaminants from primary producers to the highest trophic level (i.e. human health). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.,\n",
       " Mangrove forests of Biscayne Bay in southeast Florida, USA can sequester pollutants from freshwater inputs. This “filtering” of water minimizes point source discharges through canals, but mangroves may also play an important role in the cycling of plastic pollution that reaches the Bay. The objectives of this study are to determine: 1) The composition of debris in the Bay’s mangroves and 2) How the structure of mangrove forests affects debris distribution. Debris was hypothesized to be more abundant further into the forest due to trapping by vegetation, and mesoplastics (5 mm – 2.5 cm) would be positively correlated to macroplastics (> 2.5 cm) due to fragmentation. Nine transects were surveyed and debris was recorded by size and potential origin. 94.5% of all debris was plastic of which 57.8% were fragments. Negative binomial generalized linear regression was used to relate total plastic and mesoplastic densities to distance from shoreline, elevation, basal area, prop root and pneumatophore cover, and mangrove seedling abundance. Plastic increased with distance from shore and basal area, although the latter was just above the p-value cut-off of 0.05 for mesoplastic (p-value = 0.0513), and was weakly negatively related to prop root coverage. Total plastic was weakly negatively related to red mangrove seedlings and pneumatophore coverage, although these relationships were less clear. Mesoplastic and macroplastic were positively correlated (p-value < 0.05). Selected mangrove forests of Biscayne Bay appear to be sinks for plastic debris, where it accumulates in the interior forest from which it is unlikely to escape. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists 2024.,\n",
       " Particulate organic matter (POM), as an important component of organic matter, can act as a redox mediator and thus intervene in the environmental behavior of microplastics (MPs). However, quantitative information on the role of POM in the photoaging of MPs under ultraviolet (UV) light is still lacking. To raise the knowledge gap, through environmental simulation experiments and qualitative/quantitative experiments of active substances, we found that POM from peat soil has stronger oxidation capacity than POM from sediment, and the involvement of POM at high water content makes the aging of MPs more obvious. This is because the persistent radicals and electron-absorbing groups on the surface of POM indirectly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by promoting electron transfer, and the dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from POM under UV light (POM-DOM) is further excited to generate triplet-state photochemistry of DOM (3DOM*) to promote the aging of MPs. Theoretical calculations revealed that the benzene ring, mainly C = C, and C = O in the main chain in the plastic macromolecule structure are more susceptible to ROS attack, and the differences in the vulnerable sites contained in different plastic structures as well as the differences in the energy band gaps lead to differences in their aging processes. This study firstly elucidates the key role and intrinsic mechanism of POM in the photoaging of MPs, providing a theoretical basis for a comprehensive assessment of the effect of POM on MPs in the environment. © 2024,\n",
       " The ecological impact of microplastics (MPs) in coastal environments has been widely studied. However, the influence of small microplastics in the actual environment is often overlooked due to measurement challenges. In this study, Hangzhou Bay (HZB), China, was selected as our study area. High-throughput metagenomic sequencing and micro-Raman spectrometry were employed to analyze the microbial communities and microplastics of coastal sediment samples, respectively. We aimed to explore the ecological impact of MPs with small sizes (≤ 100 μm) in real coastal sediment environments. Our results revealed that as microplastic size decreased, the environmental behavior of MPs underwent alterations. In the coastal sediments, no significant correlations were observed between the detected MPs and the whole microbial communities, but small MPs posed potential hazards to eukaryotic communities. Moreover, these small MPs were more prone to microbial degradation and significantly affected carbon metabolism in the habitat. This study is the first to reveal the comprehensive impact of small MPs on microbial communities in a real coastal sediment environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Marine litter and plastic pollution are pressing concerns demanding immediate attention. Understanding psychological processes causing anti-environmental behavior is crucial to prevent littering. Even when people have the intention not to litter, they may still engage in littering behaviors. Therefore, this study develops a littering behavior model that incorporates the concept of implementation intention. This proposed model suggests that the willingness to admit to littering within a specific context is introduced between the behavioral intention and the actual behavior. For this study, a web questionnaire survey was conducted in Japan, yielding 4642 valid responses. We developed question items considering response bias toward socially undesirable content. Through this approach, we gathered participant responses that revealed a tendency to litter depending on the situation. The results of structural equation modeling confirmed the model’s validity, suggesting that implementation intention was a direct determinant of littering behavior. The model demonstrated that individuals may still engage in littering behavior in specific situations, despite having a goal of not littering, due to the influence of implementation intention. Accordingly, efficient interventions should be designed in alignment with this behavioral model. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " The study presents the results of the survey of beached litter on the two opposite shores of the Fields Peninsula (King George Island) conducted during the austral summer seasons of 2022 and 2023, as part of the 67th and 68th Russian Antarctic expeditions. Beaches situated on the coast of the Drake Passage were much more polluted compared to the beaches on the Maxwell Bay side. Plastic accounted for 86 % of all found items on the shores of the Drake Passage, with the majority of items related to fisheries or shipping. On the Maxwell Bay beaches, only 36 % of litter was plastic, with other categories like wood and metal dominating the total number. The average density of marine litter is 0.32 items/m (0.017 items/m2), comparable to other similar surveys conducted on Antarctic islands; however, this is at least 15–20 times lower than beach litter densities in the Arctic. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics have been an emerging threat to filtering species and the ingestion and impacts of microplastics on oysters are a cause for concern. However, much remains unknown about the effects of microplastics on flavor-related biomarkers in oysters. Herein, a laboratory microplastic exposure with concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 mg/L for 15 days was performed to investigate the impacts of microplastics on the flavor parameters of oysters. Exposure to microplastics changed the odor characteristics of oysters. Microplastic exposure had minor effects on the fatty acid composition; however, significant alterations in free amino acids and nucleotides were observed under the 1 and 10 mg/L exposure groups, respectively. The overall results indicated 10 mg/L of microplastic exposure significantly increased the equivalent umami value of oysters. These findings stressed the effects of microplastics on oysters and would be an important reference for the assessment of the potential risks associated with microplastics in marine edible species. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " In February 2018 over 100 millions of polyethylene biofilm chips overflowed from a wastewater treatment plant located at Capaccio Paestum (Italy) and due to the Thyrrhenian Sea currents, in few days they invaded the coasts of Campania, Lazio and Tuscany. During the following months the diffusion involves all the coasts of the western Mediterranean, including Spain, France and Tunisia. Samples of chips were recovered mainly along the Latium coasts (Italy) during the last 6 years. Following the exposure of the biofilm chips to the environmental conditions, the effect of natural weathering on polyethylene have been studied. The following annual decreases were evaluated: thickness 9.5 μm, diameter 18.5 μm and weight 3.7 mg while the average value of the size of all recovered items (n = 60) are: thickness = 2.936 ± 0.0406 mm, diameter = 44.349 ± 0.1266 mm and weight = 1.1593 ± 0.0248 g. Considering the weight loss, it was calculated that the complete mineralization of the disks will occur in 310 years producing about 0.5 tons of microplastics per year. FTIR analysis was used to investigate the change of chemical structure of the polyethylene. The Carbonyl index (CI), Vinyl index (VI) and Hydroxyl normalized absorbance peak were used to evaluate the polymer degradation while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the surface of the polymer samples. It was observed that erosion/degradation increases with time spent in the environment, above all from the last two years. The static contact angle was always >90° confirming that the surface of the biofilm chip is hydrophilic. The Oxygen/Carbon ratio increase with time: 0.18 and 0.27 has been found for 2018 and 2023 disks respectively confirming the progressive oxidative process. From TGA analysis a slightly reduction of decomposition temperature has been evaluated. © 2024,\n",
       " Spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics (MPs) in the nearshore seafloor sediments along the Southwest coast of India and their patterns of accumulation in selected infaunal and epibenthic molluscs with diverse feeding strategies were investigated. Along the 300-km coastal stretch, which is one of the most productive and biodiversity rich regions of the eastern Arabian Sea, notable levels of MP contamination in both sediment (617.7 items/kg dry weight) and molluscs (5.39 items/g) was recorded. The concentration of MPs in sediments also varied seasonally, with a higher prevalence during the post-monsoon season. Among the four molluscan groups studied, the highest MP abundance was recorded among scavenging gastropod Pseudominolia biangulosa (9.13 items/g), followed by microcarnivore scaphopod Tesseracme quadrapicalis (5.96 items/g). In comparison, the suspension feeding bivalve, Anadara hankeyana and deposit feeding clam Jitlada philippinarum had lesser accumulation of MPs (2.98 items/g and 3.50 items/g respectively). The majority of MPs in sediments and within molluscs were less than 250 μm in size (89.14%) and were predominantly fibres and fragments. Chemical characterisation of MPs revealed eleven types of polymers dominated by polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Present study identified positive correlations between ingested MP polymers and the feeding strategies of molluscs. Higher values for the ecological risk assessment indices (PHI, PLI and PERI) in most of the stations indicated the severity of plastic pollution in the region. Molluscs being a major contributor to the benthic food web is also a connecting link to higher trophic levels. Hence understanding the specificity in the MPs accumulation pattern within this group has far reaching significance in utilizing them as potential bioindicators for pollution studies in marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have become a popular research topic due to their potential ramifications on aquatic organisms. To evaluate the ecotoxicological impacts of chronic exposure to different microplastics on marine medaka larvae, we exposed medaka larvae to 200 μg/L of polyethylene (PE-200) and polylactic acid (PLA-200) microplastics for 60 days, respectively. The results indicated that both exposures had no significant effect on fish length/weight and did not result in fish mortality. Notably, the structure of intestinal microbiota was not disrupted either. However, microscopy observations of intestinal tissue suggested that exposure to MPs resulted in inflammation of the intestinal tract of fish and significant atrophy and shedding of small intestinal villus. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) showed that intestinal enrichment of Streptomyces occurred in marine medaka larvae in both MPs treatments, while the PE-200 treatment exhibited a significant enrichment. In addition, the PICRUSt2 prediction indicated significant upregulation of the Novobiocin biosynthesis function in gut microbiota in the PE-200 treatment. Overall, multi-level assessment is necessary to determine the risk of exposure of aquatic organisms to MPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) may be accidently ingested by many organisms due to their small size (<5 mm), and their accumulation along the food chain poses a serious threat to ecosystem health. Microorganism can directly or indirectly affect the morphology, properties, eco-toxicity, and degradation of MPs in the environment. The present review mainly aims to reveal the interaction mechanism of MPs with microorganism. We found that the most studies between MPs and microorganism are focused on bacterial in comparison with fungus and archaea in the past decade. Many microbes can accelerate the aging and degradation of MPs in soil. The abundance of MPs in indoor air is higher than that in outdoor air. The abundance of MPs in urban areas is greater than that in rural areas. The mechanism and process of MP degradation by microorganism mainly included deterioration, colonization, depolymerization, assimilation, and mineralization. Here, we review recent research on the interactions between microorganism (mainly bacteria and fungi) and MPs, and discuss characterization techniques used for revealing the MP degradation mechanisms of microorganism. However, there are several challenges associated with studies of the interactions between MPs and microorganism, and these have implications for the design of policies and the efficacy of ecological protection efforts implemented by governments worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The Mediterranean Sea's biodiversity is declining due to climate change and human activities, with plastics and emerging contaminants (ECs) posing significant threats. This study assessed phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) occurrence in four anthozoan species (Cladocora caespitosa, Eunicella cavolini, Madracis pharensis, Parazoanthus axinellae) using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All specimens were contaminated with at least one contaminant, reaching maximum values of 57.3 ng/g for the ∑PAEs and 64.2 ng/g (wet weight) for ∑APIs, with dibutyl phthalate and Ketoprofen being the most abundant. P. axinellae was the most contaminated species, indicating higher susceptibility to bioaccumulation, while the other three species showed two-fold lower concentrations. Moreover, the potential adverse effects of these contaminants on anthozoans have been discussed. Investigating the impact of PAEs and APIs on these species is crucial, given their key role in the Mediterranean benthic communities. © 2024,\n",
       " The analysis of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial environments and the evaluation of their environmental risk has gained great attention, owing to the increasing evidence for their widespread presence in soils and freshwater sediments globally. Once in the environment, MPs undergo abiotic and biotic processes which alter their properties and integrity: this process is called “aging” and has implications for the fate of these contaminants, their morphology and surface chemistry. Aging may also affect the analytical assessment of MPs in environmental samples which likely contain aged MPs. In contrast, analytical methods are established using pristine plastics for validation. This can lead to uncertainties in quantification and characterization. This critical review summarizes the current trends in the simulation and characterization of MP aging in laboratory conditions, highlighting limitations and knowledge gaps. It also discusses the challenges in MP analysis induced by aging in environmental samples, providing directions toward possible solutions. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Mangrove ecosystems have been hypothesised as a potential sink of microplastic debris, which could pose a threat to mangrove biota and ecological function. In this field-study we establish the prevalence of microplastics in sediments and commercially-exploited Anadara tuberculosa (black ark) and Ucides occidentalis (mangrove crab) from five different zones in the mangrove ecosystem of Tumbes, Peru. Microplastic were evident in all samples, with an average of 726 ± 396 microplastics/kg for the sediment, although no differences between the different zones of the mangrove ecosystem were observed. Microplastic concentrations were 1.6± 1.1 items/g for the black ark and 1.9 ± 0.9 microplastics/g for the mangrove crab, with a difference in the microplastic abundance between species (p < 0.05), and between the gills and stomachs of the crab (p < 0.01). Human intake of microplastics from these species, for the population in Tumbes, is estimated at 431 items per capita per year. The outcomes of this work highlight that the mangrove ecosystem is widely contaminated with microplastics, presenting a concern for the marine food web and food security. © 2024,\n",
       " Plastic products are widely distributed worldwide and continue to have a negative impact on the environment and organisms. Intertidal regions, which interface between upland and marine ecosystems, are regions of high ecological importance and serve as repositories for a variety of plastic wastes. However, ecological risk assessments of microplastics (MPs) in these transitional environments are still scarce. In this study, the morphological characteristics and spatial distribution of MPs in the intertidal surface sediments of Haizhou Bay were analyzed, and an ecological risk assessment framework for MPs was developed. Overall, the average abundance of MPs in the sediments was 2.31 ± 1.35 pieces/g dw. The size of the MPs was mainly less than 1 mm, and the main shape, color and polymer type of the MPs were mainly fibrous (58%), blue (30%), and PVC (22%), respectively. Cluster analyses showed that the sites could be well distinguished by size and polymer type but not by MP shape and color. According to the hazard scores, most of the sites in this area belonged to a risk level of IV, while the pollution loading index (PLI) showed that most of the sites belonged to a risk level of II. The ecological toxicity risk from the species–sensitive distribution (SSD) model showed that one–third of the sites had ecological MPs toxicity risks to marine organisms. We believe that normalized and standardized assessment methods should be implemented to monitor and manage the risk of MPs in the intertidal sediments. Particularly, the multiple dimensions, standard abundance of MPs, as well as MPs ingestion in the intertidal organisms, should be fully considered in the next step. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study evaluated the distribution and abundance of marine litter on 30 beaches around Okinawa Island, Japan. Beach quality indices and multivariate statistical analyses were used to assess the quality of the beaches and their pollution patterns. A total of 11,626 items weighing 513.49 kg with an average density of 0.13 ± 0.10 items/m2 were collected. Litter was dominated by plastics (81.72 %), broken glass (8.38 %), and cigarette butts (7.44 %), and 74.05 % of total litter was from land-based sources. Single-use plastics (SUPs) were present in all surveyed beaches and made up 30.54 % of the total litter. The clean coast index (CCI), plastic abundance index (PAI), and hazardous index (HI) were between 0.1 and 7.6, 0.1–4.0 and 0.01–1.42, respectively, indicating low to moderate levels of pollution of Okinawan beaches. This study should aid in the formation of strategies to deal with marine litter in Okinawa, other areas of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The presence of microplastics (MPs) in marine ecosystems is widespread and extensive. They have even reached the deepest parts of the ocean and polar regions. The number of articles on plastic pollution has increased in recent years, but few have investigated the MPs from oceanic islands which are biodiversity hotspots. We investigated the possible microplastic contamination their source and characteristics in surface waters off Kavaratti Island and in the gastrointestinal tract (GT) of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis collected from Kavaratti Island of the Lakshadweep archipelago. A total of 424 MP particles were isolated from the surface water samples collected from off Kavaratti Island with an average abundance of 5 ± 1nos./L. A total of 117 MPs were recovered from the GT of skipjack tuna from 30 individual fishes. This points to a potential threat of MP contamination in seafood around the world since this species has a high value in local and international markets. Fiber and blue color were the most common microplastic morphotypes and colors encountered, respectively, both from surface water and GT of fish. Smaller MPs (0.01–1 mm) made up a greater portion of the recovered materials, and most of them were secondary MPs. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant polymers found in this study. The Pollution Load Index (1.3 ± 0.21) of the surface water and skipjack tuna (1 ± 0.7) indicates a minor ecological risk for the coral islands, while the Polymer Hazard Index highlights the ecological risk of polymers, even at low MP concentrations. This pioneer study sheds preliminary light on the abundance, properties, and environmental risks of MPs to this highly biodiverse ecosystem. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " In recent years, a growing body of literature on seafloor macro-litter has been produced worldwide. However, the spatial coverage of these studies is still limited and highly unbalanced, resulting in considerable knowledge gaps in some regions. To address this lack of information in Oceania, we extracted data from the Citizen Science project Dive Against Debris® to characterize marine debris collected by volunteer scuba divers on the coastal seafloor. Overall, the average litter density was 58.22 items/100m2, with plastics accounting for approximately 50 % of the total abundance and Single Use Plastics accounting for nearly 17 %. Notably, 36 % of the total litter abundance consisted of lost Fishing Gear including fishing lines, sinkers, baits and hooks as the most abundant debris items. To reduce lost fishing gear, clean-up initiatives by divers along with management actions such as education programs for fishermen, gear restrictions and the identification of designated fishing sites are recommended. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study tested the utility of virtual reality technologies in building public awareness of an environmental issue—the growing pollution of plastic waste in oceans. We conducted an experiment to test whether viewing of VR video would produce two anticipated immersive experiences (e.g., perceived realism and spatial presence) in severely polluted oceans, and to further examine their effects on participants’ pro-environmental attitudes with regards to reducing plastic waste. Results showed that VR viewing led to higher perceived realism and spatial presence in comparisons with 2D video and audio-only conditions; perceived realism contributed significantly to pro-environmental attitude, whereas spatial presence did not. The higher the perceived realism, the stronger the pro-environmental attitude. Implications of the findings for using VR technologies for effective environmental communication are discussed. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Sea turtles face considerable risks from ingesting marine debris. They are primarily visual feeders, so color may be important for identifying food suitability or enhancing prey detection. Here, we investigated the impacts of color and texture on foraging behavior in relation to plastic consumption. We experimentally assessed the influences of color and texture as attractors for sea turtles using edible jellyfish. The findings showed that the colors of objects significantly affected selective preferences, as evidenced by different behaviors by sea turtles in response to different colors. They exhibited diet-related selectivity toward colors similar to common aquarium food, and texture had a significant impact on complete ingestion. The results suggest that plastic resembling natural prey is more likely ingested. Also, sea turtles were attracted by the color yellow, suggesting that visually distinctive items can attract them. Our results provide fundamental knowledge, helping mitigate the effects of plastic pollution on wildlife. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The growing concerns over food safety and pollutants, especially emerging contaminants like microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, have attracted considerable research attention. This paper provides a comprehensive review of MPs, heavy metals, antibiotics, and ARGs within Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), exploring their occurrence, characteristics, sources, impacts, removal strategies, and interactions. MPs are found in varying concentrations in RAS, especially in fish tissues, raising concerns about fish health. Heavy metals in RAS, originating from feed, pipe corrosion, and make-up water, accumulate, posing risks to fish and necessitating stringent control measures. Antibiotics persist in RAS water and sediment, contributing to ARGs, posing a threat to both fish and human health. Research gaps persist in the removal of MPs, efficient heavy metals control, and addressing antibiotics and ARGs pollution in RAS. Controlling MPs is crucial due to their role as ideal carriers, potential reservoirs, and hotspots for other pollutants, emphasizing the need for comprehensive approaches to mitigate environmental and health risks. The field encounters notable challenges but presents promising avenues for future research in RAS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " The hydro-meteorological conditions in marine environments are recognized to have a major impact on the transport and dispersion of microplastics (MP), although their precise effects remain poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of tidal fluctuations on MP abundance and composition in a megatidal coastal water. Waters samples were collected every ninety minutes over the course of two complete tidal cycles – one during spring tide and another during neap tide. There were no significant disparities in term of abondance, size, and composition of MPs between the samples collected during the two tidal cycles. Nevertheless, MP abundance and characteristics (morphology, size and polymer types) can be influenced over the course of a complete tidal cycle due to the impact of tidal currents and water height. This study highlights the need to consider the fluctuations of the tidal cycle when planning in-situ surveys to better assess MP pollution in coastal environments. © 2024,\n",
       " Scylla serrata plays a crucial role in India's seafood exports yet there exists limited understanding on the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in these crabs. In this baseline study, we examined the presence of microplastics in the digestive tracts of S. serrata collected from the Kota mangroves, southwestern coast of India. Our analysis revealed the presence of 264 MPs in all the samples with an average (± standard deviation) of 29.33 (±11.53) MPs/Individual. The most dominant categories were fibres (98.86 %) and fragments (1.14 %). Primarily 0.1–0.3 mm (50.90 %) and 0.3–1 mm (37.65 %) size range dominated. The predominant polymers were polypropylene (33.71 %), high-density polyethylene (31.44 %), and polyethylene terephthalate (17.80 %). Scanning electron microscopy revealed extensive weathering on the surface of the microplastics. Risk assessments indicated severe risks to S. serrata due to microplastic ingestion emphasizing the need to protect delicate ecosystems like mangroves and the biota within. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) are a pervasive pollutant in the marine environment. Pantai Teluk Likas in Sabah, Malaysia is one of the most visited beaches where tourism, recreational, and fisheries activities are high in this area. Hence, the area suffers from severe pollution, particularly from plastics. This study aims to quantify the microplastic composition in terms of color, shapes, and polymer types in marine bivalves (Anadara granosa, Glauconome virens, and Meretrix lyrata) and water column samples from Pantai Teluk Likas. All samples were digested using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and incubated in the oven for at least 48 h. Serial filtration was done for each sample before they were observed under the dissecting microscope. The microplastics were identified and counted based on their physical attributes which were colors and shapes. The functional group of the polymers was determined using FTIR spectroscopy. Microplastics were found present in all samples collected. G. virens had the highest abundance of microplastics at 113.6 ± 6.5 particles/g followed by M. lyrata at 78.4 ± 3.7 particles/g. On the contrary, A. granosa had the least microplastics with an abundance of 24.4 ± 0.6 particles/g. Meanwhile, 110.0 ± 36.2 particles/L of microplastics were found in water column samples from Pantai Teluk Likas. Based on the analysis, fibers were the most common shape in bivalves, while fibers and films were common in the water column. In terms of colors, black, blue, and red were a few of the most abundant colors observed in both samples. The most common polymer detected in all bivalve species and water column samples is polycarbonate (PC), followed by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Future study that focuses on the correlation between microplastic abundance in the marine biota and the water column is recommended to better understand microplastic availability and exposure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Few studies have documented microplastics (<5 mm) in shark gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. Here, we report microplastic contamination in the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), an apex predator and generalist feeder, at several different life stages. We examined seven stomachs and one spiral valve from eight individuals captured off the United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts (eastern US) and conducted a literature review of publications reporting anthropogenic debris ingestion in elasmobranchs. Specimens were chemically digested in potassium hydroxide (KOH) and density separated using calcium chloride (CaCl2) before quantifying and categorizing suspected anthropogenic particles (>45 μm) by size, morphology, and colour. Anthropogenic particles were found in the stomachs and spiral valve of all sharks. A total of 3151 anthropogenic particles were observed across all stomachs with 1603 anthropogenic particles observed in a single specimen. A subset of suspected anthropogenic particles (14%) were chemically identified using Raman spectroscopy and μ-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy to confirm anthropogenic origin. Overall, ≥95% of particles analyzed via spectroscopy were confirmed anthropogenic, with 45% confirmed as microplastics. Of the microplastics, polypropylene (32%) was the most common polymer. Diverse microparticle morphologies were found, with fragments (57%) and fibers (41%) most frequently observed. The high occurrence and abundance of anthropogenic particle contamination in tiger sharks is likely due to their generalist feeding strategy and high trophic position compared to other marine species. The literature review resulted in 32 studies published through 2022. Several methodologies were employed, and varying amounts of contamination were reported, but none reported contamination as high as detected in our study. Anthropogenic particle ingestion studies should continue in the tiger shark, in addition to other elasmobranch species, to further understand the effects of anthropogenic activities and associated pollution on these predators. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Plastic pollution is widespread in oceans and the ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is causing concern about potential adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to analyze the different types of plastics in the digestive tract of female small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). An alkaline digestion method using 10 % potassium hydroxide (KOH), was used. The samples were filtered and visually observed to classify the plastics according to size, shape, and color. Raman spectroscopy was further employed to identify the polymer types. The study found the presence of plastics in 89.5 % of the 200 females analyzed, including 10 polymers, with polystyrene (PS), polyamide-6 (PA6), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and silicone rubber (SR) being the most common. The polymers identified largely reflect the results of similar studies in the marine environment and were similar to global polymer diversity of microplastics, which highlights the potential of S. canicula females for biomonitoring microplastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Bone transplantation is the second most common transplantation surgery in the world. Therefore, there is an urgent need for artificial bone transplantation to repair bone defects. In bone tissue engineering, hydroxyapatite (HA) plays a major role in bone graft applications. This study deals with a facile method for synthesizing HA hexagonal nanorods from seashells by a solid-state hydrothermal transition process. The synthesized HA nanorods (∼2.29 nm) were reinforced with carbon nanotube and chitosan on graphene oxide sheets with polymeric support by in-situ synthetic approach. Among the synthesized nanocomposites viz., hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide (HA-GO), hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide-chitosan (HA-GO-CS), hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide-chitosan-carbon nanotube-polylactic acid (HA-GO–CS–CNT-PLA). Among them, the HA-GO–CS–CNT-PLA composite exhibits micro and macro porosity (∼200 to 600 μm), higher mechanical strength, (Hardness ∼90.5 ± 1.33 MPa; Tensile strength 25.62 MPa), and maximum cell viability in MG63 osteoblast-like cells (80%). The self-assembled hybrid-nanocomposite of HA-GO–CS–CNT-PLA is a promising material for bone filler application and could efficiently utilize seashell waste through the green process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The contamination of mangroves by anthropogenic litter has increased in recent decades. Notably, Brazil occupies a prominent status within Latin America, boasting the second-largest mangrove areas globally. In Santos-São Vicente Estuarine System (SESS), mangroves coexist with a preeminent port complex and substantial urbanization rates. Nevertheless, the anthropogenic litter occurrence and distribution in this ecosystem remains unknown. This study aimed to comprehensively assess anthropogenic litter across 13 strategically positioned sites in the SESS. The total litter density (Mean ± SD) was 22.84 ± 36.47 (0.00–142.00) items·m−2, putting the SESS among the top four most contaminated mangrove ecosystems worldwide. Residential zones accumulated more litter than uninhabited areas and significant correlation was seen with human modification index. Plastic was the prevalent material (70.4 %), measuring mostly between 2.5 and 30 cm (41.1 %). It is imperative that local authorities adopt comprehensive strategies to mitigate contamination, while also curtailing the litter inputs to the SSES mangrove ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics are considered an emerging environmental pollutant due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment. However, the potential impact of microplastics on human health warrants further research. Recent studies have reported neurobehavioral and neurotoxic effects in marine and rodent models; however, their impact on the underlying cellular physiology in mammals remains unclear. Herein, we exposed neural stem cells and neural stem cell-derived astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons to various sizes and concentrations of polystyrene nano- and microplastics. We investigated their cellular uptake, impact on cytotoxicity, and alteration of gene expression through transcriptome profiling. The cell type most affected by decreased viability were astrocytes after 7 days of repeated exposure. Transcriptional analysis showed that 1274 genes were differentially expressed in astrocytes exposed to 500 nm microplastics, but only 531 genes were altered in astrocytes exposed to 50 nm nanoplastics. Both canonical pathway and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that upregulated pathways were involved in neuroinflammation, innate and adaptive immunity, cell migration, proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and cytoskeleton structures. The downregulated pathways were involved in lipid metabolism, specifically fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol metabolism. Our results show that neural stem cell-derived astrocytes repeatedly exposed to nano- and microplastics for 7 days undergo changes that are hallmarks of astrogliosis. © 2024 by the authors.,\n",
       " Due to the increasing use and inadequate disposal of plastic by humans, aquatic environments have become receptacles for pollutants such as plastic. This study aimed to perform an analysis of plastic particles pollution in Brazilian aquatic ecosystems with special attention to inland aquatic environments and fish in order to identify information gaps in this field. Manuscripts published in the last 21 years and indexed in the Web of Science database were consulted. A total of 185 met the proposed inclusion criteria, such as having empirical data, being conducted in Brazil, and dealing with plastic pollution. In general, the number of studies increases over the years, and this increasing number of publications is accompanied by declared financial support; the Southeast and Northeast regions are the regions that publish the most on the topic, with São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Pernambuco being the main states; the main focus of the studies is the detection of plastic particles mainly in biota (51%) and sediment (34%), and the most frequent ecosystem is the marine (89%); regarding the taxa, the majority is about plastic detection in fish (75%). Only 18% of the papers studying fishes consider their bio-ecological data, and only 17% of the manuscripts carried out the chemical characterization of the particles. However, 99% of the papers considered the shape of the plastic particle. We emphasize the need for more research and grants for studies with Brazilian inland aquatic ecosystems on the effects of plastic particle pollution on freshwater fish. Regional and national research funding agencies are very important to encourage an increase in the number of grants and specific calls for studies on plastic pollution and its impact on freshwater biota, considering the different macro-regions in Brazil, especially in the northern region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Poor waste management and unsustainable institutional and individual behaviors, have led to the accumulation of plastic litter in many habitats worldwide. Assessment of plastic pollution in Kenyan marine environment was conducted focusing on the impact of banning the single-use plastic carrier bags in Kenya. The quantification, composition, and distribution of plastics were determined at nine (9) beaches along Kenyan coastline using standing stock method. A total of 750 plastic items were collected and categorized with only 47 pieces being single-use plastic carrier bags. A great number of plastics (n = 383), were identified by their original use, with packaging plastics being the most common (n = 155). Macroplastics were the overall dominant plastics at 76%, mesoplastics, 21% and microplastics, 3%, which were altogether dominated by low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at (46%), followed by polypropylene (PP), 30%; polyethylene tetraphthalate (PET), 9%; polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 8%; and polystyrene (PS), 7%. The absence of identifiable single-use plastic carrier bags in 6 out of 9 beaches signified the effectiveness of the ban in Kenya. Monitoring of trends and sources of plastic debris is encouraged to help enhance the science-policy linkage aimed at reducing marine plastic pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastic contamination has become increasingly aggravated in coastal environments, further affecting biogeochemical processes involved with microbial community shifts. As a key biogeochemical process mainly driven by microbiota in coastal wetland sediments, litter decomposition contributes greatly to the global greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. However, under microplastic pollution, the relationship between microbial alterations and GHG emissions during litter decomposition in coastal wetlands remains largely unknown. Here, we explored the microbial mechanism by which polyethylene microplastic (PE-MP) influenced greenhouse gas (i.e., CH4, CO2 and N2O) emissions during litter decomposition in coastal sediments through a 75-day microcosm experiment. During litter decomposition, PE-MP exposure significantly decreased cumulative CH4 and CO2 emissions by 41.07% and 25.79%, respectively. However, there was no significant change in cumulative N2O emissions under PE-MP exposure. The bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities in sediments exhibited varied responses to PE-MP exposure over time, as reflected by the altered structure and changed functional groups of the microbiota. The altered microbial functional groups ascribed to PE-MP exposure and sediment property changes might contribute to suppressing CH4 and CO2 emissions during litter decomposition. This study yielded valuable information regarding the effects of PE-MP on GHG emissions during litter decomposition in coastal wetland sediments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In aquatic ecosystems, plastic litter is a substrate for biofilms. Biofilms on plastic and natural surfaces share similar composition and activity, with some differences due to factors such as porosity. In freshwaters, most studies have examined biofilms on benthic substrates, while little research has compared the activity and composition of biofilms on buoyant plastic and natural surfaces. Additionally, the influence of substrate size and successional stage on biofilm composition has not been commonly assessed. We incubated three plastics of distinct textures that are buoyant in rivers, low-density polyethylene (rigid; 1.7 mm thick), low-density polyethylene film (flexible; 0.0254 mm thick), and foamed polystyrene (brittle; 6.5 mm thick), as well as wood substrates (untreated oak veneer; 0.6 mm thick) in the Chicago River. Each material was incubated at three sizes (1, 7.5, and 15 cm2). Substrates were incubated at 2–10 cm depths and removed weekly for 6 weeks. On each substrate we measured chlorophyll concentration, biofilm biomass, respiration, and flux of nitrogen gas. We sequenced 16S and 23S rRNA genes at Weeks 1, 3, and 6 to capture biofilm community composition across successional stages. Chlorophyll, biomass, and N2 flux were similar across substrates, but respiration was greater on wood than plastics. Bacterial and algal richness and diversity were highest on foam and wood compared to polyethylene substrates. Bacterial biofilm community composition was distinct between wood and plastic substrates, while the algal community was distinct on wood and foam, which were different from each other and polyethylene substrates. These results indicate that polymer properties influence biofilm alpha and beta diversity, which may affect transport and distribution of plastic pollution and associated microbes, as well as biogeochemical processes in urban rivers. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of substrate on biofilm characteristics, and the ecological impacts of plastic pollution on urban rivers. Practitioner Points: Plastic physical and chemical properties act as forces of selection for biofilm. Biofilm activity was similar among three different types of plastic. Community composition between plastic and wood was different. © 2024 The Authors. Water Environment Research published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Water Environment Federation.,\n",
       " The interaction of multiple stressors in freshwater ecosystems may lead to adverse effects on aquatic communities and their ecological functions. Microplastics (MPs) are a class of contaminants of emerging concern that can exert both direct and indirect ecotoxicological effects. A growing number of studies have investigated MPs-attached microbial communities, but the interaction between MPs and substrate-associated biofilm (i.e., on natural river substrates, such as stones and sediments) remains poorly studied. In this work, the combined effects of polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) with a particle size of 10–45 μm (2 mg/L) and the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) (20 μg/L) were investigated on river biofilms through a short-term exposure experiment (72 h). To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of MPs and chemical contaminants in substrate-associated river biofilms were assessed. Different response parameters were evaluated, including (i) exposure assessment and ii) contaminants effects at different levels: bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), photosynthetic efficiency (Yeff), and leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAPA). Triclosan was accumulated in river biofilms (1189–1513 ng/g dw) alongside its biotransformation product methyl-triclosan (20−29 ng/g dw). Also, PE-MPs were detected on biofilms (168−292 MP/cm2), but they had no significant influence on the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of TCS. A moderate shift in bacterial community composition was driven by TCS, regardless of PE-MPs co-exposure (e.g., increased relative abundance of Sphingomonadaceae family). Additionally, Yeff and EPS content were significantly disrupted in TCS-exposed biofilms. Therefore, the most remarkable effects on river biofilms were related to the antimicrobial TCS, whereas single PE-MPs exposure did not alter any of the evaluated parameters. These results demonstrate that biofilms might act as environmental sink of MPs. Although no interaction between PE-MPs and TCS was observed, the possible indirect impact of other MPs-adsorbed contaminants on biofilms should be further assessed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The deposition of MPs in a water column and surface sediment during a mixed spring tidal cycle of the Chao Phraya River estuary was investigated. The settling MPs during flood and ebb tides were collected by deploying traps at 3 m below the surface, while the settled MPs throughout the tidal cycle were collected by deploying traps at 1 m above the bottom. The settling rate of MPs was 2168 pieces/m2/h during highest to low tide, and 639 pieces/m2/h during high to lowest tide. The deposition rate of MPs after the end of the tidal cycle was 3172 pieces/m2/day, while the accumulation rate of MPs in the surface sediment was 1515 pieces/m2/day. The settling MPs tended to decrease inversely to the suspended solids and salinity. The major types of the deposited MPs were polyethylene (36 %) and polyamide (33 %), while that of the surface sediment was epoxy resin (80 %). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Releasing non-degradable plastics into the oceans contributes to ghost fishing and microplastic generation, thus increasing the interest in biodegradable alternatives. However, biodegradable plastics decompose slowly in marine environments, and understanding how their chemical structure influences their degradation behavior in the oceans is a growing focus. Herein, we investigated the effects of intrinsic factors such as crystallinity of polyester, the difference in Tg determined by the chemical structure, presence of natural nanofillers and additives on seawater decomposition. Moreover, the biodegradation behavior of polyesters was analyzed based on environmental conditions, such as water temperature and microbial communities. The biodegradation degrees were as follows: poly(butylene succinate-co-carbonate) > poly(butylene adipate-co-furanoate) ≫ poly‌(butylene succinate) > poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) ≫ poly(ʟ-lactic acid). No clear trend in molecular weight change of existing samples was observed because cleaved polymer chains were washed out through surface hydrolysis mechanism. Microbial species richness increased significantly during summer, with no dependency on the type of polyester. This study provides insights into the biodegradation behavior of various polyesters in seawater. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCEs), comprising mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, located at the land-ocean interface provide crucial ecosystem services. These ecosystems serve as a natural barrier against the transportation of plastic waste from land to the ocean, effectively intercepting and mitigating plastic pollution in the ocean. To gain insights into the current state of research, and uncover key research gaps related to plastic pollution in BCEs, this study conveyed a comprehensive overview using bibliometric, altmetric, and literature synthesis approaches. The bibliometric analysis revealed a significant increase in publications addressing plastic pollution in BCEs, particularly since 2018. Geographically, Chinese institutions have made substantial contributions to this research field compared to countries and regions with extensive BCEs and established blue carbon science programs. Furthermore, many studies have focused on mangrove ecosystems, while limited attention was given to exploring plastic pollution in saltmarsh, seagrass, and multiple ecosystems simultaneously. Through a systematic analysis, this study identified four major research themes in BCE-plastics research: a) plastic trapping by vegetated coastal ecosystems, b) microbial plastic degradation, c) ingestion of plastic by benthic organisms, and d) effects of plastic on blue carbon biogeochemistry. Upon synthesising the current knowledge in each theme, we employed a perspective lens to outline future research frameworks, specifically emphasising habitat characteristics and blue carbon biogeochemistry. Emphasising the importance of synergistic research between plastic pollution and blue carbon science, we underscore the opportunities to progress our understanding of plastic reservoirs across BCEs and their subsequent effects on blue carbon sequestration and mineralisation. Together, the outcomes of this review have overarching implications for managing plastic pollution and optimising climate mitigation outcomes through the blue carbon strategies. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic concentrations have been reported in a variety of environmental matrices and organisms across the world. Assessments of environmental concentrations are essential to understand trends and ensure decision-making processes that reduce environmental pressure. In this study, a combined sampling approach to surface waters, benthic sediments and biota in Galway Bay, Ireland, was carried out. Average concentrations of microplastics in surface waters were 1.42 ± 0.33 MPs m−3, in biota were 4.46 ± 0.36 MPs ind−1 and in benthic sediments were 5.60 ± 1.54 MPs kg−1. The diversity of polymers, microplastic types and colours were more abundant in surface waters and biota, when compared to benthic sediments. Integrated assessments of microplastics that follow existing monitoring programmes are essential to understand environmental trends.

       " Micro-/nano-plastic particles (MNPs) are present in the ocean with potential detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems. Bivalves are often used as marine bioindicators and are ideal to evaluate the threat posed by various-sized MNPs. We exposed the mussel Mytilus coruscus to MNPs with different particle sizes (70 and 500 nm, 5, 10 and 100 μm) for 3, 72 h and 30 days. The antioxidant responses in digestive gland and the hemolymph were then evaluated. The time of exposure played a strong modulating role in the biological response. A 3-hour exposure had no significant impact on the digestive gland. After 72 h, an increase in oxidative stress was observed in the digestive gland, including increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) production. After a 30-day exposure, the oxidative stress decreased while lipid peroxidation increased. A 30-day exposure increased hemocyte mortality (HM) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the hemolymph, while phagocytosis (PA), lysosome content (LC), mitochondrial number (MN) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) significantly decreased. Longer-term exposure to MNPs caused oxidative stress in the digestive gland as well as impaired viability and immunity of hemocytes. Particle size also influenced the response with smaller particles having more severe effects. A depuration for 7 days was enough to reverse the negative effects observed on the digestive gland and hemolymph. This study provides new insights on the effects of small-sized MNPs, especially nanoplastic particles (NPs), on aquatic organisms, and provides a solid theoretical knowledge background for future studies on toxic effects of MNPs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Plastics, particularly mesoplastics, dominate beach debris and act as carriers of hazardous chemicals, either initially present in plastics or absorbed from the surrounding environment. In this study, mesoplastics were collected from five beaches in the southern region of Spain to investigate their potential impact on marine life. In vitro assays employing fish liver cells (PLHC-1) were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of methanolic extracts derived from intact mesoplastics and after simulated photodegradation. LC-MS analysis of the methanolic extracts revealed the presence of organophosphate esters, phthalates, and phthalate alternatives. The extracts from photodegraded plastics generally showed higher cytotoxicity, ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genotoxicity (micronuclei formation) than those from intact mesoplastics. All the extracts induced EROD activity in PLHC-1 cells, indicating the presence of significant amounts of CYP1A inducers in beach mesoplastics. Thus, mesoplastics contain chemicals able to induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in PLHC-1 cells, and further photodegradation of mesoplastics facilitates the release of additional chemicals, increasing the overall toxicity. This work also highlights the usefulness of cell-based assays to better define the risks of plastic pollution. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " The escalating global microplastic (MP) pollution severely threatens marine life due to insufficient waste management and widespread single-use plastic. This study focuses on assessing MP contamination in commercial prawns from Gujarat State, India. Ten prawn species collected at five main fishing harbors revealed 590 MP particles in their gastrointestinal tracts, averaging 6.08 ± 5.96 MPs/g and 1.15 ± 0.78 MPs/individual. Significant variations in contamination levels were observed between species and study sites. Pollution indices indicated very high contamination throughout the study sites. Threads were the predominant shape, with blue and black as prevalent colors. Size-wise, 1–2 mm MPs dominated. Polymer analysis identified polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethane, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The findings provided crucial preliminary information for ecotoxicology and seafood safety investigations regarding MP contamination in commercially important prawns. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) is categorized as vulnerable in the Brazilian list of endangered animals, and its populations suffer from several anthropological threats. In this study, we analyzed the presence of macro, meso, and microplastics (MPs) in Guiana dolphins (n = 12) in Brazil Southeastern coast by analysing their gastrointestinal tract. The MP extractions were carried out with H2O2 (35 %) to remove organic matter. Four specimens ingested meso and macroplastics, including an item of polypropylene of 19.22 cm that was produced about 943 km from the place in which the animal was found stranded. All the specimens analyzed had fragment-type microplastics in their intestines. Blue was the prevailing color, followed by black, green, and red. We highlight the contamination by microplastics in the species, still little investigated, especially the need to understand the contamination by microplastics along trophic levels. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " In this work we present a novel system for marine sediment sampling aimed at microplastic (MP) assessment studies. The system is composed of a medium-sized underwater legged robot (ULR) equipped with a customized sampler consisting of a grab mounted on an underactuated mechanism. The system was developed following the requirements of marine biologists actively involved in MP pollution investigation. The requirements include the penetration depth, the weight of the sample, the possibility of collecting replicas without returning to the boat or the shore, the amount of sediment perturbation introduced by the system, and the sampling accuracy. The proposed system has been tested under controlled conditions in a tank as well as in real conditions in two different field trials. Our results showed that the proposed system is capable of meeting all user requirements by taking advantage of the capabilities of ULRs in terms of low sediment resuspension, precise position control, and increased station-keeping capabilities coupled with the custom sampler design. Sediment collected during field trials has been analyzed, extracting information about the quantity and composition of MPs, to provide an overview of the complete procedure. This work represents an important step toward the use of legged robots in marine operations and contributes to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary collaborations among roboticists and scientists to develop novel solutions and increase the sampling capabilities of end users.  © 1994-2011 IEEE.,\n",
       " Background: Carbapenemase-producing Citrobacter freundii has been reported as a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Particularly, C. freundii belonging to the sequence type (ST) 18 is considered to be an emerging nosocomial clone. Objectives: To report the genomic background and phylogenomic analysis of a multidrug-resistant NDM-1-producing C. freundii ST18 (strain CF135931) isolated from an endangered green sea turtle affected by plastic pollution in Brazil. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. De novo assembly was performed by CLC Workbench, and in silico analysis accomplished by bioinformatics tools. For phylogenomic analysis, publicly available C. freundii (txid:546) genome assemblies were retrieved from the NCBI database. Results: The genome size was calculated at 5 290 351 bp, comprising 5263 total genes, 4 rRNAs, 77 tRNAs, 11ncRNAs, and 176 pseudogenes. The strain belonged to C. freundii ST18, whereas resistome analysis predicted genes encoding resistance to β-lactams (blaNDM-1, blaOXA-1, blaCMY-117, and blaTEM-1C), aminoglycosides (aph(3′')-Ib, aadA16, aph(3′)-VI, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, and aph(6)-Id), quinolones (aac(6′)-Ib-cr), macrolides (mph(A) and erm(B)), sulphonamides (sul1 and sul2), tetracyclines (tetA and tetD), and trimethoprim (dfrA27). The phylogenomic analysis revealed that CF135931 strain is closely related to international human-associated ST18 clones producing NDM-1. Conclusion: Genomic surveillance efforts are necessary for robust monitoring of the emergence of drug-resistant strains and WHO critical priority pathogens within a One Health framework. In this regard, this draft genome and associated data can improve understanding of dissemination dynamics of nosocomial clones of carbapenemase-producing C. freundii beyond hospital walls. In fact, the emergence of NDM-1-producing C. freundii of global ST18 in wildlife deserves considerable attention. © 2024 The Author(s),\n",
       " Estuarine coastal water and sediments collected from multiple locations within the middle Río de la Plata (RDLP) estuary were analyzed in order to identify the presence of microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) and mesoplastics (MePs, 5–25 mm) in one of the most significant estuaries in the Southwestern Atlantic. The present study represents one of the first researches to survey MPs and MePs contamination in key stations at RDLP estuary. Average concentrations of 14.17 ± 5.50 MPs/L and 10.00 MePs/L were detected in water samples, while 547.83 ± 620.06 MPs/kg (dry weight) and 74.23 ± 47.29 MePs/kg d.w. were recorded in sediments. The greatest abundances were observed in the more anthropized areas, near urban settlements. Fibers were the most conspicuous plastic items in water and sediments, followed by fragments. On the other hand, surface sediments, and 50 cm and 100 cm-depth sediments also presented MPs and MePs indicating they could serve as a stratigraphic indicator for recently formed sediments. The main polymer type identified were acrylic fibers, followed by polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Besides, SEM-EDX detected the presence of Si, Fe, Ti, Al and Cl onto the plastics' surface. These elements may serve as additives to enhance the plastics' properties, such as in the case of Ti, or they could originate from the environment, like biogenic Si or Fe, and Al possibly as a component of the suspended particles or sediments adhered to the micro or meso plastics. Finally, the results of the present study showed that MPs and MePs are commonly found in waters and also tend to be trapped in sediments of the RDLP estuary supporting the assertion that these areas play a substantial role in influencing the transport, dispersion, and buildup of MPs in estuarine regions. © 2024,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have become a major environmental concern due to their persistence and potential impact on ecosystems. It is essential to understand the behavior of MPs in landfill sites to effectively manage waste and protect the environment. This study aims to investigate the behavior of MPs in a solid waste landfill site, Japan, as a case study and assess their potential sources, distribution, and environmental implications. In the targeted landfill site, microplastics (MPs) were detected in the intermediate cover soil and final cover soil, and it has been confirmed that the MPs found in intermediate cover soil originate from crushed incombustibles generated at the crushing-sorting plant. This confirmation is based on the similarity in representative components. In the rainwater reservoirs, although only a small amount of MPs was found in the surface water, a significant number of MPs were found in the sediments. Substantial quantities of MPs were identified in samples taken from the landfill site. In contrast, very few MPs were detected in raw leachate and none were found in the treated leachate at the leachate treatment facility. This suggests that treatment process is effective in removing MPs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Santa Luzia, an uninhabited island in the archipelago of Cabo Verde, serves as a natural laboratory and important nesting site for loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. The island constitutes an Integral Natural Reserve and a Marine Protected Area. We assessed marine litter accumulation on sandy beaches of the island and analysed their spatial patterns using two sampling methods: at a fine scale, sand samples from 1 × 1 m squares were collected, identifying debris larger than 1 mm; at a coarse scale, drone surveys were conducted to identify visible marine debris (>25 mm) in aerial images. We sampled six points on three beaches of the island: Achados (three points), Francisca (two points) and Palmo Tostão (one point). Then, we modelled the abundance of marine debris using topographical variables as explanatory factors, derived from digital surface models (DSM). Our findings reveal that the island is a significant repository for marine litter (>84% composed of plastics), with up to 917 plastic items per m2 in the sand samples and a maximum of 38 macro-debris items per m2 in the drone surveys. Plastic fragments dominate, followed by plastic pellets (at the fine-scale approach) and fishing materials (at the coarse-scale approach). We observed that north-facing, higher-elevation beaches accumulate more large marine litter, while slope and elevation affect their spatial distribution within the beach. Achados Beach faces severe marine debris pollution challenges, and the upcoming climate changes could exacerbate this problem. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic pollution poses threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. In this study，in order to investigate the characteristics of microplastic occurrence in different environmental media，the abundance，particle size，shape，color，and composition types of microplastics in the water column，sediment，riparian zone soil，and the benthic snail Bellamya aeruginosa of the Manao River were analyzed using field sampling，microscopic observation，and Fourier infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the average abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Manao River was（5. 9±0. 26）n·L−1；the abundance of microplastics in the upper sediment（by dry weight）was（1. 35±0. 1）n·g−1，and that in the lower sediment（by dry weight）was（0. 93±0. 12）n·g−1. The abundance of microplastics in the near riparian zone soil（by dry weight）was（0. 68±0. 16）n·g−1，and that in the far riparian zone soil（by dry weight）was（0. 69±0. 14）n·g−1，and the abundance of microplastics in the B. aeruginosa was（2. 06±0. 25）n·g−1. The analysis results showed that the abundance of microplastics in the upper and lower sediments were positively correlated；the abundance of microplastics in B. aeruginosa was positively correlated with the abundance of microplastics in the upper and lower sediments，respectively；and the abundance of microplastics in the near and far riparian zone soils were also correlated. Most of the microplastics within each environmental medium and B. aeruginosa were <0. 1 mm in size，mainly in the form of fibers and fragments，mainly blue and black in color，and mainly composed of polypropylene（PP）and polyethylene（PE）. It was found that microplastics in riparian zone soils mainly originated from the fragmentation and decomposition of agricultural plastic films. The results of this study shed light on the accumulation of microplastics in macrobenthic organisms through the investigation of microplastics in multi-environmental media and in the B. aeruginosa，which helps us to understand the potential ecological risk of microplastics in a comprehensive manner. © 2024 Science Press.

       " Microplastics are pervasive in the natural environment and pose a growing concern for global health. Plastic waste in marine environments has emerged as a global issue, threatening not only marine biota but also human health due to its implications for the food chain. This study aims to discern the patterns and trends of research, specifically on Marine Microplastic Pollution (MMP), based on a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications from 2011 to 2022. The methodology utilized in this study comprises three stages: (a) creating a bibliographical dataset from Scopus by Elsevier and the Web of Science Core Collection by Clarivate Analytics, (b) analyzing current research (trends and patterns) using bibliometric analysis through Biblioshiny tool, and (c) examining themes and subthemes in MMP research (wastewater treatment, plastic ingestion, the Mediterranean Sea, microplastics pollution, microplastics in freshwater, microplastic ingestion, plastic pollution, and microplastic pollution in the marine environment). The findings reveal that during the studied period, the number of MMP publications amounted to 1377 articles, with an average citation per publication of 59.23 and a total citation count of 81,553. The most cited article was published in 2011, and since then, the number of publications on this topic has been increasing steadily. The author count stood at 5478, with 22 trending topics identified from the 1377 published titles. Between 2019 and 2022, the countries contributing most to the publication of MMP articles were China, the United States of America (USA), and the United Kingdom (UK). However, a noticeable shift in the origin of author countries was observed in the 2019–2022 timeframe, transitioning from a dominance by the USA and the UK to a predominance by China. In 2019, there was a substantial increase in the volume of publications addressing the topic of microplastics. The results show that the most prevalent themes and subthemes pertained to MMP in the Mediterranean Sea. The journals with the highest number of MMP articles published were the Marine Pollution Bulletin (253 articles) and Science of the Total Environment (190 articles). The analysis concludes that research on MMP remains prominent and appears to be increasing each year.

       " Microplastics (MPs) are globally observed in marine as well as freshwater habitats, and laboratory studies have shown that marine organisms can accidentally ingest them. Monitoring the MP ingestion by fish in the environment is very crucial for understanding the risk of consuming MP-contaminated fish for human health. In this study, we investigated MP ingestion in 400 fish individuals from the Veraval Coast, in the state of Gujarat, India. There was 100% MP occurrence in the inedible tissues of fish, and 68% of the analyzed fishes presented MPs in edible tissues. The most dominant MPs based on their size in fishes were 0.05–0.1 mm. One hundred percent presence of only fibres in edible tissue was observed, while in inedible tissue, it was 77%, 20.42% and 2.58% of fibre, fragment and film respectively. The most common MP colour was blue. The predominant polymers were low-density polyethylene (LDPE) followed by polypropylene, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polystyrene. This is the first study performed on MPs in marine fishes from this region. Our findings suggest that the abundance of MPs observed in this area is higher than in other states of the country. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) weather after entering the environment gradually, and the interaction with metal ions in the aqueous environment has received extensive attention. However, there are few studies on Hg(Ⅱ), especially the effect of MPs on the release of Hg0(DEM) in water after entering the aqueous environment. In this study, four types of MPs (PP, PE, PET, PVC) were selected to study the adsorption and desorption behavior of Hg(Ⅱ) after photoaging and to explore the influence of MPs on the release of DEM in seawater under different lighting conditions. The results showed that the specific surface area, negative charges, and oxygen-containing functional group of MPs increased after aging. The adsorption capacity of aged MPs for Hg(Ⅱ) was significantly improved, which was consistent with the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order model, indicating that the adsorption process was a chemical and physical adsorption. The fitting results of the in-particle diffusion model indicated that the adsorption was controlled by multiple steps. Hg(Ⅱ) was easier to desorb in the simulated gastric fluid environment. Because the aged MPs had the stronger binding force to Hg(Ⅱ), their desorption rate is lower than new MPs. Under visible light and UVA irradiation, MPs inhibited the release of Hg0. Under UVA, the mass of DEM produced in seawater with aged PE and PVC was higher than that of new PE and PVC. The aged PE and PVC could produce more ·O2 -, which was conducive to the reduction of mercury. However, in UVB irradiation, the addition of MPs promoted the release of DEM, and ·O2 - also played an important contribution in affecting the photochemical reaction of mercury. Therefore, the presence of aged MPs will significantly affect the water-air exchange of Hg in water. Compared with new MPs, aged MPs improved the contribution of free radicals in Hg transformation by releasing reactive oxygen species. This study extends the understanding of the effects of MPs on the geochemical cycle of Hg(Ⅱ) in seawater, better assesses the potential combined ecological risks of MPs and Hg(Ⅱ), and provides certain guidance for the pollution prevention and control of MPs. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " In recent year, the use of plastics has become inevitable due to its unique properties that allow for the production of durable and non-durable goods. Post use, plastics enter the waste stream and now can be found in all compartments of the biosphere as microplastics (MPs). This study presents the abundance of MPs in surface water and within copepods in the southwestern Bay of Bengal during dry (June 2022) and wet season (November 2022). The MPs in the surface water were found in all three regions [Chennai, Tuticorin and Nagapattinam (four locations in each region)] and maximum in wet season (53 particles/m3). Moreover, during dry season the mean ingestion of MPs by copepods in Chennai (0.103 ± 0.04 particles/individual), Tuticorin (0.11 ± 0.07 particles/individual) and Nagapattinam (0.036 ± 0.01 particles/individual) is high compared to the wet season. The maximum level of MPs found in both surface water and ingestion by copepods in Tuticorin and Chennai is subjective to the high maritime activities than Nagapattinam region. Whatever, the anthropogenic activities in the study region increase the bioavailability of MPs pollutant in the copepods and transported to higher trophic levels, endangering marine life and human health. Hence, further studies are needed to determine their potential impact on marine food chain in this alarming situation. © 2024,\n",
       " Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is a polymer which is considered as one of the major contaminants to the environment. The PET waste materials can be recycled to produce value-added products. PET can be converted to nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanocomposites, and nano coatings. To extend the applications of PET nanomaterials, understanding its commercialization potential is important. In addition, knowledge about the factors affecting recycling of PET based nanomaterials is essential. The presented review is focused on understanding the PET commercialization aspects, keeping in mind market analysis, growth drivers, regulatory affairs, safety considerations, issues associated with scale-up, manufacturing challenges, economic viability, and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the paper elaborates the challenges associated with the use of PET based nanomaterials. These challenges include PET contamination to water, soil, sediments, and human exposure to PET nanomaterials. Moreover, the paper discusses in detail about the factors affecting PET recycling, commercialization, and circular economy with specific emphasis on life cycle assessment (LCA) of PET recycled nanomaterials. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Abstract: Microplastics research in South Africa has focused on marine and coastal areas, with limited studies reporting microplastics in freshwaters. To address this gap, we conducted this study to investigate the presence, abundance, physical characteristics, and chemical composition of microplastics in the surface water of the Vaal River, one of the most important freshwater systems in South Africa. Twenty-two surface water samples were collected along 60 km of the middle part of the river using a 55 μm plankton net. Samples were treated by acid digestion, and MPs were separated by density separation. Physical identification was performed using a Nikon stereomicroscope, and chemical composition was identified using Raman spectroscopy. MPs were observed in all samples with 0.13 to 2.52 particles/m3 concentrations. Microplastics ranged in size from 0.06 – 4.95 mm, with more than 89% less than 2 mm, and 81% were fragments (39%) and fibers (42%). Microplastics were observed in numerous colours, of which green, black, and blue were the most dominant, representing 22%, 19%, and 18%, respectively. Chemical analysis revealed the polymer types as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In addition, two colourants, pigment yellow 83 and carbon black, were detected. This study provides new data on microplastic occurrence and characteristics in the Vaal River system and offers a baseline for future monitoring. Our findings confirm that the Vaal River is under a real threat of microplastic contamination, which could impact its role as a significant freshwater system in South Africa. Highlights: • Microplastics were prevalent in the surface water of the Vaal River. • Fibrous, small-sized, and coloured microplastics were most abundant. • Polymers were identified as HDPE, LDPE, and PP. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Due to the amply exposure of marine turtles to marine plastic pollution, this is a reason that the green sea turtle Chelonia mydas makes a good candidate species as a bioindicator for plastic pollution. Turtle feces were collected at Isla Blanca on the northeast Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Microplastic extraction was done following Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012) and Masura et al. (2015) methods. After organic matter degradation of the feces samples, microplastics were identified and quantified by stereomicroscope. Their morphostructure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, while their composition was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Microplastics (MP) abundance ranged from 10 ± 2 MP·g−1 to 89 ± 3 MP·g−1. Kruskal Wallis test (KW = 70.31, p < 0.001) showed a significant difference between 22 green turtles analyzed. Most of the microplastics were fiber type. Blue, purple, and transparent fibers were the most abundant. The identified microplastics were nylon (polyamide), PVC, polypropylene, polyester, and viscose (cellulose). The non-invasive method used here allowed the detection of microplastic pollution and is promising for long-term microplastic pollution monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) have become an important concern among scientists and policymakers all around the globe. Despite this, the contribution of MPs to global warming and climate change, a significant aspect of the issue, has been overlooked. Continuous greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting in climate change have long been a major issue with apparent consequences. Climate change and plastic crises are threatening our planet, and the co-occurrence of both would be catastrophic. This article addressed the links between microplastic pollution and climate change; how MPs contribute to climate change by interacting with water, air, and soil; and recommendations to address the issues together. Throughout their lives, plastics emit GHG. MPs in water impede the climate change mitigation potential of the ocean in different ways; they hamper photosynthesis and carbon sequestration by phytoplankton and the Blue Carbon Ecosystem. MPs induce GHG emissions from the soil. Airborne MPs have the potential to aid in cloud formation and interfere with atmospheric cooling. Climate change–induced extreme events redistribute MPs in the environment, causing the pollution to increase vertically and horizontally, which then aggravates the situation in a feedback loop. The evidence acquired in the study implies that MPs and climate change are inextricably linked and that MPs play a vital role in fueling climate change. This bridges the gap between MPs and climate change issues that were previously regarded separately. Due to the linkages between these intertwined challenges, integrated and holistic research and policy measures are required to address both crises concurrently. © The Author(s) 2024.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) pollution is considered as a globally pervasive threat to aquatic ecosystems and many studies reported this pollution in different aquatic ecosystems. However, studies on MPs pollution in wetlands are still scarce. Therefore, the aim of present study was to investigate the presence of MPs in the surface water, sediment and different fish species of Amir˗Kalayeh wetland, Northern Ian. Surface water and sediment samples were collected from six stations during June to July 2022. Moreover, the gills and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of 54 fish specimens belonging to four species including Cyprinus carpio, Tinca tinca, Esox lucius and Silurus glanis were analysed. MPs were detected in all samples with an average of 2.15 ± 1.98 items/m3 for surface water, 51.66 ± 32.20 items/kg dry weight for sediments, 0.17 ± 0.17 items/individual for fish GIT and 0.12 ± 0.12 items/individual for fish gills. There was no significant relationship between MPs abundance in surface waters and sediments as well as between MPs abundance in environmental matrices and fish (P > 0.0.5). In terms of feeding habit, no significant differences were observed between the number of MPs found in omnivorous and carnivorous fish species (P > 0.05). Moreover, no significant relationship was detected between the MPs abundance in fish tissues and body size (P > 0.05). MPs were mainly fibers, mostly transparent, and in a range size of 70˗5000 µm. The dominant MPs type was nylon in all samples. This study will help increase our knowledge about MPs pollution in inland freshwater systems and suggests that management policies take essential steps to reduce this insidious problem in freshwater ecosystems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.,\n",
       " Concerning microplastics (MPs) contamination is increasing due their negative impacts on marine food webs and their potential toxicity to wildlife and humans. In this study, we analyze the presence of MPs in the stomachs of the commercial fish species Scomber colias (Atlantic chub mackerel) in the Gulf of Cadiz (GoC). Out of the 104 analyzed stomachs, 90.4 % contained some type of MPs, with an average of 5.4 MPs per individual. Of the 1152 MPs analyzed, 91.1 % were fibers, and 8.9 % fragments type. Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectrometry analysis was performed on 152 items, revealing that 73.6 % were MPs. The most common synthetic polymers found were polyamide (64 %), polypropylene (15 %), polystyrene (12 %), polyvinyl chloride (5 %), and polyethylene (4 %). The consistent ingestion of synthetic polymers by the individuals of Atlantic chub mackerel across different zones might suggest an even distribution of MP contamination throughout the GoC. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics have accumulated in the environment since plastic production began, with present-day observations that range from marine trenches to mountains. However, research on microplastics has only recently begun so it is unclear how they have changed over time in many oceanic regions. Our study addressed this gap by quantifying the temporal and spatial dynamics of microplastics in two deep-water regions of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We isolated agglutinated foraminifera from sediment cores and assessed microplastics that were incorporated into their tests. Our results indicated that microplastics were incorporated by agglutinated foraminifera after plastic production began. Microplastics were higher at deep-water sites and closer to the Mississippi River. This study confirms the presence of microplastic incorporation into agglutinated foraminifera tests and investigates microplastics in deep-water sediments in the GOM. Additional work is needed to fully identify the distribution of microplastics across the GOM and other oceanic basins. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The term ‘blue economy’, first introduced in 2010, is the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, jobs, ocean health, and to improve livelihoods. However, a sustainable blue economy faces various challenges in the form of global warming, ocean acidification, and lack of knowledge about the ocean; for example, 95% of the sea is still unexplored, making it more important to understand the blue economy and implement it on a global scale. Other challenges include harmful algal blooms (HABs), invasive species, coral bleaching, and thermohaline circulation. This review discusses various aspects of the blue economy like food, value-added products, offshore energy, oxygen source, mining, fisheries, carbon sequestration, and cloud seeding. The future aspects of blue economy, like sustainability, effective policies, and reducing carbon footprints and microplastics are also explored here. © 2024, Indian Academy of Sciences.,\n",
       " The aim of the paper was to develop chitosan-coated nanoliposomes for carrying bioactive peptides derived from hydrolyzed shrimp waste (SW) with chitosan coating (concentrations of 0, 0.5 and 1% W/ V). The study involved producing SW hydrolysates using protease enzymes from Bacillus salsus bacteria, followed by investigating the physicochemical, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of the peptide-loaded nanoliposomes. The dispersion index ranged from 0.17 to 0.65, and the particle size varied from 500 to 685 nm. Increasing the chitosan concentration to 1% significantly increased the particle size (P < 0.05). The Zeta potential of the nanoliposomes became positive as the chitosan concentration increased, starting from − 47.73 mV and reaching + 36.40 mV. The highest encapsulation efficiency (84.67%) was observed in nanoliposomes with 1% chitosan, while uncoated liposomes had the lowest encapsulation efficiency (44%). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the nanoparticles exhibited homogeneous, spherical, and cluster-shaped structures with smooth surfaces. Chitosan coating enhanced the stability of the peptides in simulated stomach and intestinal environments, with higher stability observed at higher chitosan concentrations (P < 0.05). Chitosan-coated nanoliposomes exhibited higher antioxidant and antimicrobial activities compared to uncoated nanoliposomes. Increasing the chitosan concentration resulted in greater inhibition of free radicals (DPPH and ABTS free radical activities increased significantly in nanoliposomes with 1% chitosan compared to uncoated samples: 32.56–70.28% and 41.58–80.28% respectively) and enhanced antimicrobial properties (P < 0.05). In conclusion, coating hydrolyzed SW with nanoliposomes and chitosan improved the structural, physicochemical, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of the peptides, making them suitable for direct application in food products requiring antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.,\n",
       " Whether intentionally manufactured or resulting from fragmentation of larger plastic debris, micro-sized plastic fragments (<5 mm), commonly referred to as microplastics, are ubiquitous in the environment. Therefore, correctly ascertaining their prevalence, in order to accurately estimate their environmental, ecotoxicological and health impacts, is of the utmost importance. However, simple, straightforward and efficient methods for their routine monitoring remain scarce. In this scenario, staining techniques, following adequate sample pre-processing, have been vastly used as a simple method to visually sort microplastics in diverse matrices. Nile Red, despite its widespread use, also has limitations, thereby preventing it from being applied at a large(r) scale. Herein, we overview the different types of dyes that have been used in microplastic detection studies, with the purpose of assessing the state of the art concerning new and alternative methods for visual inspection of microplastics along with each method's features that underly their potential for large-scale applicability. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Nanoplastic contamination has become an issue of environmental concern but the information on the potential adverse effects of nanoplastics on marine ecosystems is still limited. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the effects of the exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs; 0.05, 0.5 and 5 μg/mL) on the brittles star Ophiactis virens. Diverse endpoints at different levels of biological organization were considered, including behavior, arm regeneration capacity and oxidative stress. PS-NPs were observed on the brittle star body surface but not in inner tissues. Accumulation of PS-NPs was observed in the pre-buccal cavity of animals exposed to 5 μg/mL PS-NPs which also displayed delayed righting activity and an oxidative stress condition. Nevertheless, no effect was observed on arm regeneration efficiency at any tested PS-NPs concentration. Overall, our results highlighted that prolonged exposure to high amounts of PS-NPs could interfere at least partially with the physiology of O. virens. © 2024,\n",
       " Since the urban stormwater inlet (USI) acts as a link in the migration of microplastics (MPs) in stormwater, sufficient information on MPs in USI sediments is very important for understanding urban diffuse microplastic pollution. In this study, the abundance and characteristics of MPs in the USI sediments of Ma'anshan City, China, were analyzed based on urban land use type. MPs were prevalent in the USI sediments, with the average abundances of 536.77 ± 313.92 items·kg−1 for commercial areas, 505.64 ± 400.82 items·kg−1 for campuses, 694.71 ± 219.95 items·kg−1 for industrial areas, 526.41 ± 152.34 items·kg−1 for residential areas, and 1107.75 ± 422.10 items·kg−1 for main roads, indicating a high microplastic pollution in the USI sediments from main roads. The microplastic polymers were mainly polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polystyrene (PS), accounting for 46.75 %–100.00 %, with PP MPs being the most abundant. Fiber MPs had the highest proportion in USI sediments from both campuses (35.30 %) and industrial areas (38.19 %), while film MPs were the most abundant for both commercial areas (39.91 %) and residential areas (35.65 %). The average proportions of fiber (27.29 %), fragment (29.18 %), and film (28.68 %) were almost equal for main roads, unlike other land use types. Except for campuses, transparent MPs were the most common for all land use types, with average proportions of 29.60 %–42.70 %. The proportions of MPs with sizes of <1000 μm were 72.54 % for commercial areas, 77.11 % for campuses, 76.05 % for industrial areas, 70.76 % for residential areas, and 74.29 % for main roads, respectively, with a consistent result with previous study that the MPs of <1000 μm are the predominant in the environment. This study enriches the knowledge of microplastic pollution in USI sediments and will benefit the mitigation of diffuse microplastic pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution in lakes has received much attention as an increasing amount of plastic waste enters aquatic ecosystems. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the global distribution patterns, environmental hazards, factors driving their presence, and the relationships between sources and sinks of MPs. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of drivers of lake MP pollution based on 42 articles on MP pollution from three different aspects: geographical distribution, driving factors and environmental risks. The results revealed differences in the MP pollution levels across the different sampling sites in the global lakes. Moreover, there is significant heterogeneity in the abundance of MPs among various lakes, whose distribution pattern is affected by geographical location, sampling method and extraction method. The size of the MPs differed significantly between water and sediment, and the proportion of small (<1 mm) MPs in sediment was significantly greater than that in water (72% > 46%). Environmental risk assessment reveals that the risk level of MP pollution in most lakes worldwide is low, and the environmental risk of pollution in lake water is higher than that in sediment. Based on the risk assessment and geographical location of the lake, the risk of MP pollution is related not only to human activities and economic development but also to local waste management practices, which directly impact the accumulation of MPs. Therefore, we suggest that the production of biodegradable low-risk polymer plastics instead of high-risk materials, and plastic solid waste recycling management should be strengthened to effectively mitigate the presence of MPs in the environment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " The primary objective of this research was to assess microplastics (MPs) in the sediments of Chilika lake. MPs were extracted from 22 sediment samples using the density separation method combined with vacuum pump filtration. A stereo-zoom microscope and Raman spectroscopy were employed to identify the sediment-associated MPs. The total MPs collected from all 22 sites was 440 ± 3.53 particles kg−1 wet sediments, with sizes ranging between 50 and 500 μm. In terms of morphology, fibers and fragments emerged as the dominant MP types, with counts of 210 ± 1.66 and 175 ± 1.76 particles kg−1 wet sediments, respectively. Raman spectroscopy verified the presence of various MP polymers in the sediments, predominantly HDPE (37 %), followed by PS (20 %), PET (18 %), PA (11 %), PP (7 %), and PC (7 %). A notable color variation was observed in MPs; black being the most prevalent (38.8 %), succeeded by blue (19.5 %), green (11.8 %), white (11.5 %), red (10.6 %), and transparent (7.5 %). ANOVA results indicated significant (p > 0.05) variations in MP abundance across the 22 sampling locations. However, principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis indicated that water quality parameters did not significantly influence MP abundance, yet it was found that MP retention was higher in fine-grained sediments like clay and silt. The leading sources of MPs in Chilika lake were found to be aquafarming, trailed by river and sewage discharges, fishing activities, antifouling coatings and tourism. Additionally, the pollution load index (PLI) was employed to gauge the ecological risks, categorizing the lake under risk category 1, which implies a minimal level of MPs pollution. This research aims to serve as an early warning system for MPs pollution in productive brackish water habitats globally, including Chilika lake, guiding policymakers towards appropriate management strategies and preventive measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " Massive amounts of microplastics are transported daily from the oceans and rivers onto beaches. The ocean plastisphere is a hotspot and a vector for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, very little is known about the plastisphere in beach sand. Thus, to describe whether the microplastics from beach sand represent a risk to human health, we evaluated the bacteriome and abundance of ARGs on microplastic and sand sampled at the drift line and supralittoral zones of four beaches of poor and good water quality. The bacteriome was evaluated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, and the ARGs and bacterial abundances were evaluated by high-throughput real-time PCR. The results revealed that the microplastic harbored a bacterial community that is more abundant and distinct from that of beach sand, as well as a greater abundance of potential human and marine pathogens, especially the microplastics deposited closer to seawater. Microplastics also harbored a greater number and abundance of ARGs. All antibiotic classes evaluated were found in the microplastic samples, but not in the beach sand ones. Additionally, 16 ARGs were found on the microplastic alone, including genes related to multidrug resistance (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, tetM, mdtE and acrB_1), genes that have the potential to rapidly and horizontally spread (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, and tetM), and the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics that are typically regarded as the ultimate line of defense against severe multi-resistant bacterial infections (blaKPC). Lastly, microplastic harbored a similar bacterial community and ARGs regardless of beach water quality. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of microplastics in beach sand worldwide may constitute a potential threat to human health, even in beaches where the water quality is deemed satisfactory. This phenomenon may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Since the 1950s, plastic pollution and its risk have been recognized as irreversible and nonnegligible problems as global plastic production has increased. In recent years, the transport and trophic transfer of microplastics (MPs) in biotic and abiotic environment have attracted extensive attention from researchers. In this study, based on the Ecotracer module from Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model, the marine ranching area of Haizhou Bay, Jiangsu Province, China, was taken as a case study by linking the environmental plastic inflow with MPs in organisms to simulate the variation of MPs in the marine food web for 20 years, as well as its potential trophic transfer and biomagnification. We found that the concentration of MPs in top consumers first increased when the concentration of MPs in the environment increased, while that in primary consumers first decreased when the concentration of MPs in the environment decreased. Moreover, high TL consumers had a stronger ability to accumulate MPs, and pelagic prey fishes was the opposite. From the perspective of the food web, all functional groups showed significant trophic magnification along with the trophic level and no biodilution. Generally, there is a direct relationship between the MPs in marine organisms and environmental inflow. If the pollutants flowing into the environment can be reduced, the MP pollution problem in coastal waters will be effectively alleviated. Our research can further provide a scientific basis for ecological risk assessment and management of MPs and biodiversity protection in marine ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics and antibiotics are emerging pollutants in the environment and have received widespread attention globally. In coastal areas, microplastic and antibiotic pollution is ubiquitous and often overlapping. Microplastic-antibiotic compound pollutants that are formed through adsorption have thus become a major concern. However, modeling knowledge of microplastic transport in coastal areas is still limited, and research on the impact of compound pollutants caused by Polythene (PE)-antibiotics in such settings is in early stages. In this study, using a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and temporal Markov method (TMM) under a statistical-physical framework, we simulated pollutant transport and PE-antibiotic compound pollutants in coastal areas. First, a series of models are proposed, including an LBM wave-current coupling model, an LBM antibiotic transport model, an LBM particle-tracking model, a TMM microplastic transport model and the final LBM-TMM hybrid compound pollutant model. Then, the suitability and applicability of the models was validated using experimental data and numerical simulations. Finally, the models were applied to a study area, Laizhou Bay (China). The simulation results demonstrate that adsorption will reduce the concentration of antibiotics in the water environment. Within 44 days, the adsorbed antibiotic carried by PE particles migrate further, and the width of the pollution zone escalates from 234.2 m to 689.0 m. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " As an emerging form of pollution, microplastic contamination of the coastal ecosystems is one of the world's most pressing environmental concerns. Coastal sediments have been polluted to varying degrees by microplastics, and their ubiquitous presence in sediments poses a threat to marine organisms. However, there is currently no ecological risk assessment of microplastics on aquatic biota in sediments. This study, for the first time, established a new procedure to evaluate the toxicity of microplastics on aquatic biota in sediments, based on the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) concept. The choice of Zhelin Bay as the case study site was based on its severe pollution status. The average content of microplastics in the sediments of Zhelin Bay was 2054.17 items kg−1 dry weight, and these microplastics consisted of 46 different species. Microplastics in sediments exist in five different forms, with the film form being the main composition, and the majority of microplastics have particle sizes ranging from 100 to 500 μm. Correlation analysis (CA) reveals significant negative correlations between microplastic abundance, and Al2O3 and SiO2. The toxicity of microplastics, based on the PRA concept, suggests that Zhelin Bay surface sediments had a low probability (3.43%) of toxic effects on aquatic biota. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " This study presents a comprehensive review of the characterization, quantification, and ecological risk assessment of microplastics (MPs) in soils and sediments. MPs, defined as plastic particles of size smaller than 5 mm, have been less studied in these environments compared to aquatic ecosystems. Broadly, all analytical methods include the following steps: sampling, extraction, polymer identification, and quantitation/particle counting. This review highlights the variation in current methodologies for sampling, extraction, and quantification of MPs, which hinders data comparison across studies. This poses a real challenge to compare the data of various studies. Hence, there is an urgency to develop standardized methodologies for analyzing MPs in different environmental matrices. Spectroscopic techniques such as FT-IR and Raman are the most widely used techniques for polymer identification. Adopting proper quality control and quality assurance measures will improve the reproducibility and comparability of results. This review calls for further research on MPs’ effects on soil and sediment environments to inform standardization efforts and improve our understanding of MPs pollution.

       " Tardigrades are remarkable microorganisms known for their extraordinary resilience in diverse environments, including extreme conditions such as outer space. They are known for their interactions with natural substrates in terrestrial and aquatic systems, but have remained largely unexplored in relation to marine plastics. This study aims to investigate the colonization of plastics, ranging from fossil fuel-based to bioplastics, in the coastal zones of four countries (Brazil, Ireland, France and Italy). Here, we report the first documented occurrence of tardigrades colonizing plastic substrates. We identified five amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to the Tardigrada phylum, specifically in a post-consumer polypropylene, in the coastal zone of Galway, Ireland. This discovery raises questions about the characteristics of different plastics influencing on tardigrades' adhesion. Tardigrades hitchhiking on plastics in the oceans could expand their habitat range, possibly displacing native species and altering trophic interactions, with potential consequences for the overall biodiversity. © 2024 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastics and nanoplastics are found in marine biota across a wide range of trophic levels and environments. While a large portion of the information about plastic exposure comes from gastrointestinal (GI) data, the relevance of particle accumulation from an oral exposure compared with other types of exposure (e.g. dermal, respiratory) is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, larval zebrafish (7 days post fertilization) were exposed to two different sizes of nanoplastics through either oral gavage or a waterborne exposure. Larvae were tracked for 48 h post exposure (hpe) to assess the migration and elimination of plastics. Larvae eliminated orally gavaged nanoplastics within 48 hpe. Oral gavage showed limited particle movement from the GI tract into other tissues. In contrast, waterborne nanoplastic-exposed larvae displayed notable fluorescence in tissues outside of the GI tract. The 50 nm waterborne-exposed larvae retained the particles past 48 hpe, and showed accumulation with neuromasts. For both sizes of plastic particles, the nanoplastics were eliminated from non-GI tract tissues by 24 hpe. Our results suggest that waterborne exposure leads to greater accumulation of plastic in comparison to oral exposure, suggesting that plastic accumulation in certain tissues is greater via routes of exposure other than oral consumption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,\n",
       " Microplastics have become one of the hot concerns of global marine pollution. In recent years, diversity and abiotic influence factors of plastisphere microbial communities were well documented, but our knowledge of their assembly mechanisms and co-occurrence patterns remains unclear, especially the effects of depth on them. Here, we collected microorganisms on microplastics to investigate how ocean depth affects on microbial diversity, community composition, assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns. Our results indicated that there were similar microbial richness and community compositions but microbial evenness and unique microbes were obviously different in different ocean layers. Our findings also demonstrated that deterministic processes played dominant roles in the assembly of the mesopelagic plastisphere microbial communities, while the bathypelagic microbial community assembly was mainly shaped by stochastic processes. In addition, the co-occurrence networks suggested that the relationships between microorganisms in the mesopelagic layer were more complex and stable than those in the bathypelagic layer. Simultaneously, we also found that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota were the most abundant keystones which played important roles in microbial co-occurrence networks at both layers. This study enhanced our understanding of microbial diversity, assembly mechanism, and co-occurrence pattern on plastisphere surfaces, and provided useful insights into microorganisms capable of degrading plastics and microbial remediation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.,\n",
       " A promising strategy to counteract the progressing plastic pollution of the environment can involve the replacement of persistent plastics with biodegradable materials. Biodegradable polymers are enzymatically degradable by various hydrolytic enzymes. However, these materials can reach the environment in the same way as conventional plastics. Therefore, they are accessible to terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biota. Once ingested by marine organisms, highly active enzymes in their digestive tracts may break down biodegradable compounds. We incubated microparticles of five different biodegradable plastics, based on polylactictic acid (PLA), polybutylene succinate (PBS), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV), in-vitro with the gastric fluid of the edible crab Cancer pagurus and evaluated the hydrolysis rates by pH Stat titration. A plastic blend of PLA with PBAT showed the highest hydrolysis rate. The enzymes in the gastric fluid of crabs were separated by anion exchange chromatography. Fractions with carboxylesterase activity were identified using fluorescent methylumbelliferyl (MUF)-derivatives. Pooled fractions with high carboxylesterase activity also hydrolyzed a PLA/PBAT plastic blend. Carboxylesterases showed molecular masses of 40–45 kDa as determined by native gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Our study demonstrated that digestive carboxylesterases in the gastric fluid of C. pagurus exhibit a high potential for hydrolyzing certain biodegradable plastics. Since esterases are common in the digestive tract of organisms, it seems likely that other invertebrates possess the ability to hydrolyze biodegradable plastics. © 2023 The Authors,\n",
       " Microplastic (MP) pollution pervades global ecosystems, originating from improper plastic disposal and fragmentation due to factors like hydrolysis and biodegradation. These minute particles, less than 5 mm in size, have become omnipresent, impacting terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments worldwide. Their ubiquity poses severe threats to marine life by causing physical harm and potentially transferring toxins through the food chain. Addressing this environmental crisis necessitates a sustainable strategy. Our proposed solution involves a highly efficient copper substitute polyoxometalate (Cu-POM) nanocluster infused triple interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogel, comprising chitosan (CS), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyaniline (PANI) (referred to as pGel@IPN) for mitigating MP contamination from water. This 3D IPN architecture, incorporating nanoclusters, also enhances the hydrogel's photodegradation capabilities. Our scalable approach offers a sustainable strategy to combat MPs in water bodies, as demostrated by the adsorption behaviors on the hydrogel matrix under varying conditions, simulating real-world scenarios. Evaluations of physicochemical properties, mechanical strength, and thermal behavior underscore the hydrogel's robustness and stability. Detecting minute MP particles remains challenging, prompting us to label MPs with Nile red for fluorescence microscopic analysis of their concentration and adsorption on the hydrogel. The catalytic properties of POM within the hydrogel facilitate UV-induced MP degradation, highlighting a sustainable solution. Our detailed kinetics and isotherm studies revealed pseudo-first-order and Langmuir models as fitting descriptors for MP adsorption, exhibiting a high maximum adsorption capacity (Qm). Notably, pGel@IPN achieved ∼95% and ∼93% removal efficiencies for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) MPs at pH ∼ 6.5, respectively, also demonstrating reusability for up to 5 cycles. Post-end-of-life, the spent adsorbent was efficiently upcycled into carbon nanomaterials, effectively removing the heavy metal Cr(vi), exemplifying circular economy principles. Our prepared hydrogel emerges as a potent solution for MP removal from water, promising effective mitigation of the emerging pollutants of MPs while ensuring sustainable environmental practices. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.,\n",
       " Microplastics (MPs) and antifouling paint particles (APPs) are important components of marine microdebris (MDs), which constitute a potential environmental risk. This study analyzed baseline contamination levels of MDs and mesodebris (MesDs) in intertidal sediments at different depths, exploring the geomorphological influence in three Argentine coastal environments: Bahía Blanca Estuary (BBE), Los Pocitos (LP) and Puerto Madryn (PM). The MDs and MesDs samples were characterized by μ-FTIR, SEM/EDX and XRD. The abundance of MPs and APPs in sediments, range between 19.78 and 1087.19 and between 0 and 172.93 items/kg d.w., respectively. Despite variations in population and industrial developments in these areas, MPs abundance shows no significant differences in low and high intertidal zones. However, mean MPs concentrations were higher in the surface layer (0–5 cm) compared to the deeper sediments (5–10 cm), indicating recent MPs deposition. Chemical characterization evidenced the presence of cellulose (CE) and denser polymers as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyacrylics (PAN), APPs, metallic and black MDs. Surface degradation and heavy metals (Zn, Cr, and Ba) were also detected in APPs and other MDs, either as additives or adhered to their surfaces. Changes in crystallinity were also observed on the MesDs due to weathering. The calculated polymer hazard index (PHI) and the presence of hazardous polymers such as ABS and PAN indicated an increased risk of MPs pollution on the BBE and PM coasts. The pollution load index (PLI) values (from 4.63 to 5.34) suggested unpolluted to moderately polluted levels. These findings offer insights into potential risks associated with MDs in Argentine intertidal sediments, underscoring the critical need to comprehend the geomorphology and the influence of coastal dynamics. This is crucial for effectively addressing challenges linked to MDs pollution guiding the development of robust management and mitigation strategies. © 2023,\n",
       " The massive amount of marine debris generated from land to the marine ecosystem could bring various negative impacts on the flora and fauna that resides there. To properly remove marine debris from the marine ecosystem, the marine debris needs to be identified and measured first so relevant parties can execute the job easily with the right tools and methods. Various studies had been conducted to detect and quantify marine debris using deep learning models and remote sensing devices to capture the debris footage. But most of the studies don't include a platform such as a web or mobile application for executing the developed model. In this paper, a concept mobile application called MarinaWatch is proposed that brings marine debris monitoring through drone detection and quantification using a deep learning model on a single mobile platform with the combination of cloud computing. © 2024 AIP Publishing LLC.,\n",
